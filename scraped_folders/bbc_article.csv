Is a Gaza ceasefire deal in sight?Published4 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"At the Nova festival site in southern Israel, attacked by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, the families and friends of Israeli hostages began a long march to Jerusalem on Wednesday. The festival site, near Kibbutz Re'im, is where hundreds of Israelis were killed and hundreds more dragged away into Gaza. The marchers, carrying pictures of those still missing, are demanding that their government do more to bring the remaining 134 hostages home. Their hopes have been raised by talk of a ceasefire. ""One hundred and forty-five endless days and nights of yearning for our loved ones,"" Ronen Neutra said, addressing the crowd. Ronen's 22-year-old son, Omer, is somewhere in Gaza. ""We send them strength, and ask them to hold a little longer,"" Ronen said. ""Omer, just a little longer. A deal is possible."" Since US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators met in Paris last weekend, the Israeli press has been full of talk of a deal to pause the fighting. No document has been made public, outlining the latest proposals, but whenJoe Biden said an agreement might be in place by Monday, speculation only increased. But what might a deal look like? It is thought a ceasefire could last for six weeks, during which time 40 Israeli hostages would gradually be released. Female civilians and soldiers would be freed first. In return, around 400 Palestinian prisoners, some of them convicted of serious terrorist offences, would be released from Israeli jails. Israeli soldiers might move away from some of Gaza's most populated areas, and some of the 1.8 million Palestinians displaced by the fighting since October might be able to return to homes in the north. But with talks still going on in Qatar this week - where Egyptian and Qatari mediators are shuttling between Israeli and Hamas delegates - it is clear that most issues are still up in the air. Reports suggest that there is still wrangling over the number of Palestinian prisoners released for each Israeli hostage. Nor is there yet thought to be agreement on the redeployment of Israeli soldiers or the return of Palestinians to their homes. But Haim Tomer, a former Mossad chief of division, with experience of previous negotiations, told me he was optimistic. ""I think that we are pretty close,"" he said. ""I'm not saying that for sure we will see the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. But I think that the negotiation is getting forward."" He cited comments by the Qatar-based leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, who gave the first oblique hint on Wednesday that the group might be softening its position on a deal. ""Any flexibility we are showing in the negotiations,"" he said in a televised address, ""is to protect the blood of our people and to put an end to their huge pains and sacrifices in the brutal war of extermination against it."" Mr Haniyeh went on to say that Hamas was ready to keep fighting if necessary, and he urged Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem to defy Israeli restrictions and march on Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The reference to ""flexibility"" indicated that Hamas might be reconsidering demands - a complete end to the fighting and the total withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip - which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called ""delusional."" But Hamas has yet to respond formally to the proposals drawn up in Paris. It is also not known what Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, thinks about the deal. He was last filmed in an underground tunnel, somewhere underneath Khan Yunis or Rafah. His guerrilla army is slowly being annihilated above him and the Israeli government has vowed to capture him. Israeli officials have suggested that Mr Sinwar's authority has been severely eroded by five-and-a-half months of crushing bombardment and the deaths of tens of thousands of his people. Such reports are hard to verify, but one thing is certain - it is harder and harder to communicate with the man who launched the attacks of 7 October. Meanwhile, the families and friends of the remaining hostages are on the road. They say they will reach Jerusalem on Saturday. Will good news be waiting for them when they get there?",2024-02-28T22:22:35.000Z

Journalists call for foreign media access to Gaza in open letterPublished4 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"More than 50 journalists have sent an open letter calling on Israel and Egypt to provide ""free and unfettered access to Gaza for all foreign media"". The letter is signed by correspondents and presenters for broadcasters with UK bases, including the BBC's Jeremy Bowen, Lyse Doucet and Mishal Husain. It says the need for comprehensive on-the-ground reporting is ""imperative"". Israel's military says its troops have taken journalists on escorted trips in Gaza to allow them to report safely. Palestinian journalists and media workers have reported from inside Gaza since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October, but dozens have been killed, injured or gone missing. In the letter, the 55 journalists write that ""foreign reporters are still being denied access to the territory, outside of the rare and escorted trips with the Israeli military"". The escorted trips are highly controlled and often only to show tunnels that the military says are used by Hamas or weapons stores. Only one foreign journalist has been granted entry into Gaza through Egypt on an escorted visit. CNN's Clarissa Ward - who is among the signatories of the letter - was able to spend only a few hours on the ground in the southern border city of Rafah with an Emirati medical team in December. The letter calls on Israel's government to ""openly state its permission for international journalists to operate in Gaza"". It also asks Egyptian authorities to allow foreign press access to the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza. The letter continues: ""It's vital that local journalists' safety is respected and that their efforts are bolstered by the journalism of members of the international media. The need for comprehensive on-the-ground reporting of the conflict is imperative. ""The risks of conflict reporting are well understood by our organisations who have decades of experience of reporting in warzones around the world and in previous wars in Gaza."" The broadcasters represented in the letter are the UK's BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky News, and the US outlets ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC. A number of journalists who signed the letter have been reporting from Israel during the conflict. In November, the BBC's international editor Jeremy Bowen travelled with Israeli forces into Gaza. While the BBC had editorial control of the report, the section with the Israeli forces was viewed by them. When asked for comment on the letter, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said: ""The IDF is currently conducting a war against the terror organisation Hamas. ""In order to allow journalists to report safely, the IDF accompanies them when in the battlefield."" Last month,the Foreign Press Association (FPA) in Jerusalem accused Israel of imposing an unprecedented ban on independent foreign press access to Gaza, after the Israeli High Court of Justice rejected a petition from the organisation and ruled that restrictions on entry were justified on security grounds. The FPA said defence authorities had told the court that journalists in Gaza could be put at risk in wartime and endanger soldiers by reporting on troop positions. They also argued that it was too dangerous for Israeli personnel to be present at the Israeli border to facilitate press entry to Gaza. The court's ruling also cited defence authorities as stating that the Rafah crossing was ""under the control and sovereignty"" of Egypt, and that ""to the best of [their] knowledge"" the Egyptian government was allowing foreign journalists to enter Gaza. However, in late October a senior Egyptian official said it was the Israeli military stopping journalists from entering. Almost 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza during the war between Israel and Hamas, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel's military launched an air and ground campaign after Hamas's attacks on Israel on 7 October, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 253 others were taken hostage. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 83 Palestinian and two Israeli journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of the war.",2024-02-28T20:06:38.000Z

Joe Biden wins Michigan primary despite sizeable Gaza protest votePublished4 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"President Joe Biden has won Michigan's Democratic presidential primary comfortably, despite a significant protest vote over strong US support for Israel in the war in Gaza. Mr Biden won 81% of the vote, according to projections, but the ""uncommitted"" exceeded expectations with 13%. His campaign will pay close attention to see if that result in the key swing state will spread nationwide. Many voters have been angered by the US stance in the Israel-Hamas conflict. On Wednesday, activists from the group Listen to Michigan and its supporters hailed the size of the protest vote - more than 100,000 - as a victory. They pledged to continue to pressure the Biden administration to back a ceasefire in Gaza and limit foreign aid to Israel. ""What is clear is that our president has a choice before him,"" said Abdullah Hammoud, mayor of Dearborn, a Detroit suburb with a large Arab-American population. ""It is my hope, Mr President, that you listen to us, that you choose the people of America over Benjamin Netanyahu."" People were in tears at the organisation's watch party on Tuesday night as tallies were updated. The US is a close ally of Israel, providing it with billions of dollars in military aid. Earlier this month the US vetoed a UN resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, while proposing a draft of its own urging a temporary ceasefire. Many people, including in Mr Biden's own party, want the president to take a much stronger stance against Israel's military campaign. ""I think he should be cognisant of it as he moves forward with his Middle East policy,"" Larry Sabato, a political analyst at the University of Virginia, said of the ""uncommitted"" vote. ""Because the truth is, he's losing a lot of votes, not just Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, but young people."" The ""uncommitted"" result could bolster similar protest efforts underway in states like Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. Mr Trump is also projected to easily win Tuesday's Republican primary in the state, after what he called a ""great day"". Results so far from the primary contests - which the US political parties use to select their presidential candidate - indicate that the two men are on course to face off in November's general election in a rematch of 2020. Michigan is considered a critical swing state, which picked the winning president in the last two contests. It has the largest proportion of Arab-Americans in the country, but Mr Biden's support for Israel appears to have cost him support among that demographic. The war in Gaza began after Hamas's attack in southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Israel has launched a massive military operation in the Palestinian territory since then, with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas. However, almost 30,000 people have been killed and 70,325 injured in the retaliatory campaign - most of them civilians, the Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip says. The huge toll has led to international pressure on Israel and calls for a ceasefire. Tuesday does not mark the first time a significant portion of Michiganders opted to cast votes as ""uncommitted"". Around 19,000 residents did so in 2020's primary and more than 21,601 in 2016. In 2008 it was 238,000 - after Barack Obama's campaign encouraged them to do so, because he chose not to be on the ballot due to party squabbles. But campaigners in Michigan have been organising for months to send Mr Biden a message of ""no ceasefire, no vote"" over the war in Gaza. At Salina Intermediate School in Dearborn, the BBC spoke to Hala, 32, who said she voted ""uncommitted"". She did not ""want to vote for Genocide Joe"", she explained - alluding to allegations made against the Israeli military during its campaign in Gaza, which Israel strongly denies. Hala - who declined to share her last name - said she voted for Mr Biden last time, but was not sure she would do so again when the presidential election comes round. ""Maybe, if he calls for an immediate ceasefire, but he's not going to do that,"" she said. Some members of the state's Armenian community also pushed for a protest vote over what they see as a failure of the Biden administration to address the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Other Democrats told the BBC on polling day that they remained supportive of Mr Biden, including Kim Murdough, an office manager at a church in the city of Flint. ""I voted Democrat. I personally don't have an issue with anything that the administration has done,"" she said. She added that separate concerns about Mr Biden's age - 81 - were not a deal-breaker for her. ""I'd rather have someone in office that forgets a few things than a criminal,"" she said, referencing Mr Trump, who faces federal and state criminal charges. Margaret Won voted for Mr Biden, too. She is mostly happy with the work the president has done, though said he had been blocked in some of his aims by Republicans in Congress. She said she wished the frontrunner presidential candidates were younger and said if Nikki Haley beat Mr Trump to the Republican nomination, she might get her vote. Ms Haley, however, is yet to win any primary contest against Mr Trump -a trend that continued on Tuesday. Like dozens of other states, Michigan has open primary elections - which means Democrats, Republicans and independents were all able to cast votes, though they had to ask for a specific party's ballot when casting their ballot. The state's remaining Republican delegates - who must be secured for a candidate to win their party's nomination - will be formally awarded later at a convention this weekend. During the present conflict between Israel and Hamas, the ""uncommitted"" movement gained endorsements from at least 39 state and local elected officials in Michigan, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib. Ms Tlaib's sister was the campaign manager for Listen to Michigan campaign. Samraa Luqman, an activist with the Abandon Biden campaign, said her goal was to ""oust somebody from office for having this many lives lost without calling for a ceasefire"". Another woman, who did not want to be named, told the BBC she had even switched to the Republican party over the Middle Eastern conflict. Most foreign policy analysts agree that Mr Trump, who has boasted of being the most pro-Israel president in US history, would be even less likely to challenge Israel's Gaza policy if he returns to the White House next year. Senator Gary Peters, from Michigan, told reporters at a meeting arranged by the Biden campaign on Monday that the president understood voters' concerns about Gaza. However, the White House has been reluctant to row back its support, sending billions of dollars in military aid to Israel and three times blocking a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire.",2024-02-28T19:33:57.000Z

"Marches will continue, pro-Palestinian groups tell James CleverlyPublished4 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Pro-Palestinian groups have hit back at James Cleverly's call to end protest marches, after the home secretary said ""you've made your point"". In aninterview with the Times, Mr Cleverly questioned whether holding regular marches ""adds value"" to their call for an end to fighting in Gaza. Shamiul Joarder of Friends of Al-Aqsa (FOA) said: ""We will continue to march until there is an immediate ceasefire."" The FOA is part of a coalition of groups organising the marches. Representatives from all six groups - together with Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and campaign group Liberty - held a press conference earlier in Parliament. They argued that anti-Muslim ""hysteria"" from some MPs and pressure from the government had provoked the Metropolitan Police into heavy-handed and ""discriminatory"" policing of ""peaceful mass protests"". Some Conservative MPs have called for the Met to take a tougher line on protests. The Metropolitan Police has been contacted for a response. Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said: ""The demonising of protests for Palestinian rights [is] driven by pro-Israel actors in the political establishment in order to deflect attention away from Israel's decades-long repression of the rights of the Palestinian people."" He said his organisation would ""review"" the need for further marches if a ceasefire is agreed between Israel and Hamas. US President Joe Biden this week said he was hopeful a ceasefire deal could be in place by next week, with negotiations continuing. ""If we feel that there is a moment where a permanent ceasefire is called, then we will look at whether or not we need to continue marching,"" Mr Jamal told the meeting. He also defended protesters using the chant ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" on marches. Critics of the chant, including Israel and most Jewish groups, argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel. This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself. Jewish Conservative MP Andrew Percy said the phrase, which was projected on to Parliament last week while a Gaza ceasefire debate was taking place in the Commons, was a ""genocidal call"". Mr Jamal said his organisation had not projected the slogan on to Parliament but he defended the right of protesters to use it, ""despite the rhetoric being used to demonise it"". He said it had ""been used by the majority of Palestinians for decades"" and ""it speaks to the nature of how the rights of the Palestinian people are deprived"". He added: ""It in no way calls for the abrogation of anybody else's rights."" Large demonstrations have been taking place across the UK since the 7 October attacks on Israel by Hamas and Israel began its military assault in response to destroy the group in Gaza. On Wednesday, Mr Cleverly announced a £31m ($39m) package to bolster protection for MPs, some of whom have spoken about being intimidated and harassed by pro-Palestinian backers. Mr Cleverly told the Times it was vital that MPs were not ""bullied"" into changing their stance on the Gaza conflict due to threats from demonstrators. ""I genuinely don't know what these regular protests are seeking to achieve,"" he added. ""They have made their position clear, we recognise that there are many people in the UK that hold that position."" The government says it is also considering increasing the amount of notice protest organisers have to give the police, following a recommendation by the Commons Home Affairs Committee. The Palestine Solidarity Campaign says it does not support protests outside MPs' homes, but has defended the right to stage peaceful protests outside MPs offices and council chambers. Mr Joarder said campaigners would continue to lobby MPs and protest outside Parliament until there was a permanent ceasefire. ""We are encouraging democracy, we are bringing people closer to democracy,"" he told the meeting in Parliament. March organisers are planning to raise their concerns with the Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist on Friday, ahead of further planned protests.",2024-02-28T17:00:59.000Z

'Uncommitted' protest vote in Michigan primary is warning Biden cannot ignorePublished4 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Michigan voters have sent a clear warning to the White House that Joe Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza could cost him dearly in the presidential election in November. Activists encouraged people voting in Tuesday's Democratic primary to withhold their votes from President Biden and instead mark the box marked ""uncommitted"" as a protest. More than 100,000 voters did just that. The protest vote - while a sharp rebuke - poses no immediate danger to Mr Biden, who still won the contest with 81% of the vote. He's the incumbent president and has no serious challenger from within his party, so he can't lose the race to choose the Democratic candidate. But what if all the people who withheld their support from him this time don't come out to vote for him in the general election? That could be decisive. Every vote counts in a key swing state that the US president almost certainly needs to win to have a shot at a second term. In 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton lost Michigan to Donald Trump by fewer than 11,000 ballots. Mr Trump, following his own victory in the Republican primary, declared: ""We win Michigan, we win the whole thing."" This Midwestern state is home to America's largest Arab-American population, most of whom are deeply upset by the devastation they see in Gaza. President Biden can't afford to ignore their demands that he call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza - rather than the temporary one that the White House has been pushing for. He did not mention the war or the protest vote in his statement following his victory, but his campaign team will have surely heard the message loud and clear. I asked Leyla Elabed, manager of the ""Listen to Michigan"" campaign, if she was worried she might be inadvertently helping Donald Trump back into the White House by damaging Joe Biden's electability. ""If Biden doesn't act now, and listen to the 80% of Democrats and the 66% of Americans that want a permanent ceasefire right now,"" she told me before Tuesday's primary, ""it is going to be Biden, his administration and the Democratic Party that are going to be accountable for handing the White House to Trump in November."" President Biden has offered some recent criticism of Israel's conduct of the war, describing it as ""over the top"". He appears to be becoming increasingly frustrated with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and has warned that Israel is at risk of losing international support. His administration is strongly advocating for a temporary ceasefire over the Muslim holiday of Ramadan that would include an exchange of  Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. But Mr Biden says it's not the right time to call for the permanent ceasefire his detractors in Michigan are demanding. Dissatisfaction on this issue goes beyond the Arab-American and Muslim communities, however. Many younger voters - another key part of the electoral coalition that voted for the oldest-ever US president - are also angry. Regular protests are taking place on college campuses across America. In Detroit, the views of students from the Wayne State College Democrats highlighted President Biden's vulnerability on the issue. Karon Heath, 18, an anthropology and law major, said she was enraged that the White House had not been advocating for a permanent ceasefire despite months of war and ""heartbreaking"" scenes in Gaza. Taylor James, 22, who is studying economics, believes the US - Israel's strongest international ally - should stop sending aid to Mr Netanyahu's government. But Cassidy Collins did vote for Mr Biden on Tuesday. She thinks he needs all the support he can get to stop Mr Trump from returning to the White House. She described that prospect as ""one of the most scariest things I could possibly imagine"". Each of these students said they wished Mr Biden had stood aside and allowed another candidate to get the Democratic nomination this year. They think that at 81, he is too old to understand the concerns of their generation, and that he hasn't been aggressive enough on climate change or on forgiving student loan debt. The complaints from these young people - each of them a signed-up Democrat - were different to the concerns I tend to hear from undecided voters who are considering backing Donald Trump. Those moderate voters - whom I've met in the wine bars of Atlanta, the sandwich shops of Philadelphia and the rural outposts of Iowa - often help decide who wins the White House. They've told me they felt much better off when Donald Trump was in office. And they're not convinced yet by the Biden administration's attempts to persuade Americans the economy is improving. Nearly every voter also cites the record levels of illegal immigration at the southern border. It's a vulnerability that explains why Mr Biden is about to tackle the immigration issue head on with a high-profile visit to the border on Thursday. Donald Trump will also be there on the same day to argue that Mr Biden's policies are to blame for the crisis. The White House hopes to undermine Mr Trump on his signature issue by highlighting that the former president recently got his supporters in Congress to defeat a bipartisan bill that would have provided billions of dollars to beef up border security. Mr Biden may soon introduce a presidential executive order aimed at reducing the number of asylum seekers entering the US. Yet it could be too late to convince voters he can be trusted on this issue. The president is simultaneously under attack from the right by voters who blame him for allowing unprecedented numbers of migrants to enter the US - and on the left by disappointed Democrats who are appalled by his strong support for Israel. The president needs to address both issues - and to find a way to appeal to the middle, while also motivating his base. It will not be an easy strategy to pull off. None of the dozens of Michiganders protesting over the war in Gaza that I spoke to this week said they were planning to vote for Mr Trump. But if the deeply felt anger towards Mr Biden in parts of Michigan leads thousands of voters to stay home in November, or to cast their ballot for a third party candidate, that could still cost Mr Biden the White House.

Gaza: States calls for 'immediate suspension' to hostilitiesPublished4 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Jersey's States Assembly has supported calls for ""an immediate suspension of hostilities"" leading to ""a permanent ceasefire"" in Gaza. Politicians unanimously agreed to a proposition from Deputy Montfort Tadier, after it had been amended by the External Relations Minister. Earlier,around 60 people had gathered in the Royal Squarein St Helier to call for peace. Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas havebeen at war since early October. States Members concluded: ""An immediate suspension of hostilities should be established to enable the unconditional release of hostages and those held under unlawful detention, the urgent provision of humanitarian assistance, and a permanent ceasefire."" They also agreed: ""To express their profound sadness and dismay at the extent of loss of civilian lives in Gaza and Israel and to condemn the taking of hostages and all acts of aggression which violate international law and result in death and harm to civilians, especially women and children."" The wording of the proposition underwent a number of changes before it was put to a final vote. Mr Tadier wanted to include the words ""international law should be adhered to in order to stop further significant loss of civilian lives and to avoid potential acts of genocide"". He referred to an interim ruling of the UN's top court,which last month ordered Israelto take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. Israel hasvehemently rejected the accusationsas ""baseless"" and ""wholly unfounded"". Deputy Ian Gorst, however, persuaded the assembly to remove references to ""potential acts of genocide"". He said he had received communications from people who felt ""at best uncomfortable, and at worst intimidated"" by the inclusion of those words within the proposition. Of his revised version of the text, Mr Gorst said: ""This is an amendment which would support a cessation of hostilities, a permanent ceasefire, an end to death and destruction and encourage diplomatic solutions to this conflict. ""It is an amendment which I would be able to deliver in our engagement with the United Kingdom and shows Jersey is a balanced, credible, mature jurisdiction but also one which understands and respects unity within its own borders."" As a result of the vote, Jersey's government has been asked to express the States Assembly's view to the UK government. Follow BBC Jersey onX (formerly Twitter)andFacebook.

Israel-Gaza peace mural in east London defacedPublished4 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An Israel-Gaza peace mural painted on a street in east London has been defaced 16 days after it was unveiled. It was created by the charity Circle of Toys, which said it wanted to highlight ""the true victims of war"" - children. Located on Old Street, Shoreditch it depicts two girls - one in a headscarf waving an Israeli flag and another waving a Palestinian flag. The charity said the graffiti showed ""even more the importance of shifting the focus away from political debate"". The painting was unveiled on 10 February. Circle of Toys began in the aftermath ofRussia's invasion of Ukrainewith the goal of sending toys to children caught up in conflict. It recently established a base in the Middle East and hopes to encourage people to donate toys to children in Israel and the Palestinian territories. The graffiti reads 'Palestinian children killed since 07.09.23 11,500' and 'Funded by your taxes. Murder is murder'. The spray paint alludes to 7 September 2023, which is likely to be a reference to 7 October 2023 whenHamas attacked Israel, which started the war. Israel says more than 1,200 civilians were killed in the attack andmore than 250 people were taken hostage. In response, Israel conducted significant retaliatory attacks on Gaza, both on the ground and from the air. The Hamas-run health ministry claims the death toll in Gaza now stands atmore than 29,500and continues to rise. Israel has also forcefullydisplaced more than 85% of Gaza's population, sparking ahumanitarian crisisin the region. Tensions have flared in London since the conflict began. Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak haspreviously saidhe was ""proud"" to support Israel in its ""long war"" against Hamas, which he branded ""pure evil"". There has also been a numberof pro-Palestinian marchesthrough London and last November, a war memorial wasdefaced with anti-Israel graffiti. Hate crimes against both Muslim and Jewish communities haveincreased substantiallyacross the capital in the aftermath of 7 October attack. Following news of the vandalism, the founder of Circle of Toys, Arthur Corvin Powells said ""this reaction shows even more the importance of shifting the focus away from the political debate and instead onto the future for the children"". The charity added that the mural may be cleaned or re-painted and it was in talks with the mural artists to decide its next steps.

Israel-Gaza war: Netanyahu and Biden spar over support for conflictPublished5 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Popular support for Israel in the US will help it fight ""until total victory"" over Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. In a statement, Mr Netanyahu cited polls showing that more than 80% of Americans support Israel during the conflict in Gaza. His comments come after US President Joe Biden warned that Israel risks losing global support in the war. US officials say they are working on a possible ceasefire deal. In his statement on Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu said that, since the beginning of the conflict, he has been leading a campaign ""countering international pressure to end the war ahead of time and mobilise support for Israel."" ""We have significant successes in this area,"" Mr Netanyahu added, citing a recent Harvard-Harris poll showing that 82% of the American public supports Israel. ""This gives us more strength to continue the campaign until complete victory."" On Monday, Mr Biden said the US hopes to have a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza ""by next Monday."" The US president also suggested later on that Israel could ""lose support from around the world"" if it ""keeps up with this incredibly conservative government they have"". Another poll, from the Associated Press and Norc, found that about half of US adults in January believed Israel had ""gone too far"" - up from 40% in November. White House and State Department officials on Tuesday confirmed that negotiations on a temporary ceasefire were continuing, but declined to give details on the substance of the talks or potential timelines. John Kirby, the White House's National Security Council spokesperson, said that ""significant progress"" had been made towards a deal last week to allow hostages to leave Gaza and let humanitarian assistance in. ""We're building on that progress this week and the president and his team remain engaged around the clock with multiple partners in the region,"" Mr Kirby added. ""But as the president said just in the last 24 hours or so there's no deal as of yet. And there's a lot more work to do."" The ceasefire, Mr Kirby said, would ""hopefully"" allow for a six-week pause, significantly longer than previous pauses in the fight. ""Maybe that could lead to something more in terms of a better approach to end the conflict,"" he said. At the State Department, spokesman Matthew Miller said that US diplomats - working with Qatar, Egypt and Israel - are ""trying to push this deal over the finish line"", but that ""ultimately, we would need Hamas to say yes."" A Hamas official had earlier told BBC News the group's priorities were on ending hostilities, rather than the release of hostages. Israel launched a large-scale air and ground offensive in Gaza after Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 253 hostages, some of whom have since been released. The Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip says at least 29,878 people have been killed in the territory since then - including 96 deaths in the past 24 hours - in addition to 70,215 who have been wounded.",2024-02-27T21:16:09.000Z

Gazans in survival mode with cold nights and food rationsPublished5 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"This morning dawned with news of US President Joe Biden's hopes for an imminent ceasefire between Israel and Gaza, but many on the Gaza Strip could not think beyond scraping together breakfast. ""Before the war we used to buy bread, now we make it,"" said 26-year-old journalist Aseel Mousa. The BBC has spent the day following the lives of people across Gaza - as they scoured markets for food, worked in overcrowded hospitals and tried to keep their children entertained. There were periods where we did not hear from our contacts - messages remained on one tick on WhatsApp and phone calls went to voicemail. The Israel-Gaza war erupted on 7 October when Hamas gunmen infiltrated southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 253 others hostage. About 130 are still being held in Gaza, and we could not speak to them. Relatives in Israel are left waiting, with no idea of the conditions they are being held in. At least 29,800 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. This is a day in the life in Gaza. 05:00:In Rafah, 59-year-old Sami Abu Omar wakes up early after a ""hard night"". ""Any person in this situation has to get used to sleeping for an hour to an hour and a half only,"" he says, describing the sound of bombing. After getting out of his tent, he prays and then heads to a distribution centre, where he will serve up lentil soup to displaced families. 07:00:In the central city of Deir al-Balah, nurse Rewaa Mohsen changes the nappies of her two young daughters. One was born two days before the war. She says each day now follows the same routine of trying to survive and care for her children. After changing their nappies, she prepares breakfast. 09:00:Elsewhere in Deir al-Balah, 22-year-old medical student and volunteer doctor Nagham Mezied takes a photo of her breakfast. She used to eat at 06:00 but has recently been pushing it back to try to stave off hunger later in the day. The dish this morning is called Mankouche - cheese, herbs pepper and olive oil on bread. ""This is all I eat until the evening, if we are lucky to have another meal then, otherwise this is all until tomorrow."" 09:30:Lawyer Mosa Aldous is walking in Rafah after a restless night in his tent. ""It was so cold,"" he says. He can see long queues for food and water, but his attention this morning is on finding an internet connection. ""Now I am two kilometres away from my tent, trying to find signal but it is still very weak. I am slowly, slowly walking further from the tent,"" he says. 11:00:Journalist Aseel Mousa is also in Rafah, but in a flat. She ""seized the chance"" to do some work in the morning after finding that she had power and an internet connection. Now, she is in the process of making bread with her mum. ""We get wood, start a fire, make dough, put it into portions, let it rise. This is what we're doing now. This process takes at least three hours,"" she says. 11:00:At around the same time, there is excitement in Rafah as Mosa sees aid being delivered by plane. Crowds gather on the beach. ""We suddenly heard loud noises in the sky so went out and saw large aeroplanes throwing aid via parachutes,"" he says. 11:30: Back at the food distribution centre, Sami Abu Omar says four big pots of soup have already been served up. ""Today it's cloudy and there might be rain soon. Our mothers, when this kind of weather comes, make lentil soup, so we've done this too for the displaced people so they feel more like they're at home,"" he says. 12:40:Aseel Mousa and her mum have finished making the bread, which they ate with tinned beans and eggs. ""It wasn't nice, I don't like canned food, but this is what is available in Gaza,"" she says. ""I used to eat cheese and toast in the morning but now these kinds of food are not available. So it wasn't good. But the bread was perfect because me and my mum prepared it."" In the past, she says, she would have ordered breakfast to her office: cinnamon rolls or pastries. She has sent her laptop to a neighbour who has solar panels so it can be charged. She does this every day. 14:30:Nurse Rewaa Mohsen is trying to keep her eldest daughter entertained. ""She has her cousins to play with. Also has toys,"" she says over a WhatsApp message. ""We try to keep her busy so she doesn't hear the bombs."" She plans to nap soon with her two daughters. 14:40:  Back in Rafah, lawyer Mosa Aldous says he has given up on trying to find connection. Over a patchy line, he says he is with his family again in their tent. The line goes dead. 15:30:Rewaa's hopes of napping did not go to plan. She sends a video of her daughter with her eyes wide looking at the camera and adds a grinning emoji. ""She refuses bottled milk. I gave her some in the first month and after that it was not available so she is dependant on breast milk,"" she writes. ""My mum and only sister were killed in November and I don't have anyone to help me with them [her children]."" 16:13:At al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital where she volunteers, Nagham Mezied reflects on the ""harsh realities of war"". ""Overflowing with displaced people seeking shelter - it has become a refuge for those who have lost everything: their homes, their loved ones, their sense of security."" She says diseases are spreading and that they are struggling with shortages of basic equipment and supplies. 16:37:Rewaa sends a picture of her lunch - chicken with peppers and olives. She says the ingredients cost them more than $40 (£32). It will be the last meal she will eat today. ""We are blessed that we can afford two meals. Some people can't afford any,"" she says. As she feeds her daughters she thinks, too, about how rising prices are affecting caring for them. Her eldest daughter is wearing the same clothes as when the war began. She struggles to afford nappies. 17:17:Aseel, the journalist, reminisces about her former life. ""Before the war at this time, I used to be coming back from work to my home, and then I would relax on my bed and talk to my mum about my day. Now, it is not just boredom - it's anxiety, tension all the time,"" she says by WhatsApp message. ""Now we will prepare lunch, which will be canned peas, because there is nothing fresh. We only really eat tinned food."" 19:45:  Volunteer doctor Nagham Mezied finished her shift a couple of hours ago. She dreams of having a hot shower ""to release the fatigue of the day"" but there is no gas and no water. She gets ready to cook some dinner - most likely tinned chickpeas and fava beans - and then will go to sleep. ""The day in Gaza now ends early as we have no internet and no electricity - we have nothing to do. We try to sleep early and have some rest in case the night brings bombs and terror.""

Israel Gaza: Biden hopes for ceasefire by next weekPublished5 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"US President Joe Biden says he hopes to have a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza by Monday. His comments come amid reports of some progress in indirect negotiations involving Israeli and Hamas officials. It would involve aid deliveries to Gaza and the release of more hostages taken during the 7 October Hamas attacks. Israel has not commented and Hamas officials have indicated the two sides are not as close to a ceasefire deal as Mr Biden suggested. Qatar, which has been mediating in the talks alongside Egypt, said there was no deal to announce yet. The Qatari foreign ministry spokesman, Majed al-Ansari, said Doha was ""going to push for a pause before the beginning of Ramadan"" and felt ""hopeful, not necessarily optimistic"". Israel launched a large-scale air and ground campaign in Gaza after Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel. The attackers also took 253 people hostage, a number of whom have since been released. The Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip says at least 29,878 people have been killed in the territory since then - including 96 deaths in the past 24 hours - in addition to 70,215 who have been wounded. According to Reuters news agency, quoting an unnamed source close to the talks, Hamas is still studying a draft framework, drawn by France, which would include a 40-day pause in all military operations and the exchange of Palestinians held in Israeli jails for Israeli hostages, at a ratio of 10 to one. ""We're close,"" President Biden told reporters in New York on Monday. ""We're not done yet. My hope is by next Monday we'll have a ceasefire."" On NBC's ""Late Night With Seth Meyers"" which was broadcast later, the president said Israel would be willing to pause its assault during Ramadan if a deal was reached. The Islamic holy month begins around 10 March. ""Ramadan's coming up and there has been an agreement by the Israelis that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan as well, in order to give us time to get all the hostages out,"" Mr Biden said. On Tuesday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that ""talks continue"" but that ""ultimately, some of this comes down to Hamas"" to agree. ""We'd certainly welcome one by this weekend...we are trying to push this deal over the finish line,"" Mr Miller added, although he declined to comment further on the negotiations or possible timing. ""We think it's possible."" However, a Hamas official told the BBC earlier: ""The priority for us in Hamas is not the exchange of detainees, but the cessation of the war. ""It is not logical, after all this loss of life and property, to accept any offer that does not lead to a complete ceasefire, the return of the displaced, and the reconstruction of Gaza."" Last week, the US - Israel's main ally - was widely criticised for vetoing a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Instead, it proposed its own resolution for a temporary ceasefire ""as soon as practicable"", which also warned Israel not to invade the southern Gazan city of Rafah ""under current circumstances"". Israel has faced mounting international pressure not to launch an offensive in Rafah, where about 1.5m Palestinians are sheltering, most having fled fighting further north in the territory. ""There are too many innocent people that are being killed,"" Mr Biden said on Late Night With Seth Meyers. ""And Israel has slowed down the attacks in Rafah. They have to. And they've made a commitment to me they're going to see to it that there is ability to evacuate significant portions of Rafah before they go and take out the remainder of Hamas."" On Sunday, the Israeli prime minister's office said it had received plans from its military to evacuate civilians from areas including Rafah. Mr Netanyahu said in an interview with CBS on Sunday that Israeli forces would eventually launch an invasion of Rafah regardless of any agreement for a temporary ceasefire, insisting: ""We can't leave the last Hamas stronghold without taking care of it."" ""If we have a deal, it'll be delayed somewhat,"" he added. ""But it'll happen. If we don't have a deal, we'll do it anyway."" In a separate development on Monday, Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh resigned along with his government, which runs parts of the occupied West Bank. President Mahmoud Abbas accepted his decision, which could pave the way for a technocratic government. Mr Abbas is under pressure from the US to reform the PA so it can govern Gaza after the Israel-Hamas war ends. Last week, Mr Netanyahu presented a vision for the territory that made no mention of any role for the PA.",2024-02-27T19:20:02.000Z

Gaza Strip in maps: How life has changedPublished5 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Almost two million people in Gaza - most of the population - are reported to have fled their homes since Israel began its military operation in response to Hamas's deadly attacks of 7 October. The Strip has been under the control of Hamas since 2007 and Israel says it is trying to destroy the military and governing capabilities of the Islamist group, which is committed to the destruction of Israel. Gaza - a densely populated enclave 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea on one side and fenced off from Israel and Egypt at its borders - has ""simply become uninhabitable"", according to United Nations officials. Israel warned civilians to evacuate the area of Gaza north of the Wadi Gaza riverbed, ahead of its invasion in the weeks after the Hamas attack. The evacuation area included Gaza City - which was the most densely populated area of the Gaza Strip. The Erez border crossing into Israel in the north is closed, so those living in the evacuation zone had no choice but to head towards the southern districts. After an intense bombing campaign and ground invasion into northern Gaza and Gaza City, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have refocused operations on southern Gaza. The main urban areas in the south - Khan Younis and Rafah - have been bombed and Israeli troops have clashed with Hamas fighters on the ground. Palestinians, including those who fled fighting in the north, had been told to move to a so-called ""safe area"" at al-Mawasi, a thin strip of mainly agricultural land along the Mediterranean coast, close to the Egyptian border. Fighting in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah has already pushed tens of thousands of people to flee to the southern district of Rafah, the UN said, where more than one million people ""are squeezed into an extremely overcrowded space"". According to the UN, just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - were already registered refugees before Israel warned Palestinians to leave northern Gaza. Palestinian refugees are defined by the UN as people whose ""place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 War"". More than 500,000 of the refugee population lived in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Following Israel's warnings after 7 October, many of those refugees joined the hundreds of thousands of people forced to flee their homes, the UN says. About 1.7 million Palestinians are now gathered in emergency shelters or informal sites set up nearby. On average, before the conflict, there were more than 5,700 people per sq km in Gaza - very similar to the average density in London - but that figure was more than 9,000 in Gaza City, the most heavily populated area. The UN says more than half of Gaza's population is now crammed into Rafah - a town of originally 250,000 people. ""Their living conditions are abysmal - they lack the basic necessities to survive, stalked by hunger, disease and death,"" according to the UN's relief co-ordinator Martin Griffiths. The UN warns that overcrowding has become a major concern in its emergency shelters in central and southern Gaza, with some far exceeding their capacity. Many of these emergency shelters are schools and in some there are dozens of people living in a single classroom. Other families are living in tents or makeshift shelters in compounds or on open areas of waste ground. Areas of new tents that sprung up close to the Egyptian border between the start of December and middle of January cover roughly 3.5 sq km, equivalent to nearly 500 Premier League football pitches. The satellite images, captured on 15 October and 14 January, show a dramatic change - now nearly every patch of accessible, undeveloped ground in an area of north-west Rafah has been turned into a refuge for displaced people. Even before the current conflict, about 80% of the population of Gaza was in need of humanitarian aid, and although Israel has been allowing some aid in from Egypt, aid agencies say it is nowhere near enough. They say that half of Gaza's population is starving and most of the population regularly go without food for a whole day.  Save the Children said people were being forced to forage for scraps of food left by rats and eat leaves out of desperation to survive. A seven-day ceasefire at the end of November allowed agencies to deliver an average of 170 trucks and 110,000 litres of fuel a day, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says. The daily average is now about 76. Aid trucks are still crossing into Gaza, but the WHO has warned that delivering that aid ""continues to face near insurmountable challenges"" as the area endures intense bombardment, movement restrictions, interrupted communications and fuel shortages. Israel has already launched hundreds of airstrikes across Gaza. US intelligence assessments seen by CNN says Israel has used more than 29,000 bombs and missiles since the start of the conflict, causing extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure. The World health Organization says up to 80% of civilian infrastructure - including homes, hospitals, schools, water, and sanitation facilities - have been destroyed or severely damaged and will take billions of dollars of investment over decades to recover. The UN's environmental programme says it could take between three and 12 years just to clear the debris and explosive remnants of war. Gazan officials warn more than 500,000 people will have no homes to return to, and many more will not be able to return immediately after the conflict because of damage to surrounding infrastructure. The map below - using analysis of satellite data by Corey Scher of CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University - shows which urban areas have sustained concentrated damage since the start of the conflict. They say at least 150,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip have suffered damage. North Gaza and Gaza City have borne the brunt of this, with at least 80% of buildings in the two northern regions believed to have been damaged, but their analysis now suggests up to 64% of buildings in the Khan Younis area have also been damaged. Many healthcare facilities have been left unable to function as a result of bomb damage or lack of supplies and fuel. The UN says hospital capacity is overstretched and only 12 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are still partially functioning. More than 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed during the Hamas attacks on 7 October. Almost 30,000 Palestinians - including about 8,000 children - have been killed in Israeli airstrikes and operations since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. It is difficult for the BBC to verify exact numbers, but the UN's World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has no reason to believe the figures are inaccurate. Israeli officials initially claimed the airstrikes would be accompanied by a ""complete siege"" of Gaza by Israel, with electricity, food and fuel supplies cut, followed by military action on the ground. The IDF began its ground operations by moving into Gaza from the north-west along the coast and into the north east near Beit Hanoun. A few days later Israeli forces cut across the middle of the territory to the south of Gaza City. Armoured bulldozers created routes for tanks and troops, as the Israeli forces tried to clear the area of Hamas fighters based in northern Gaza. Having cut Gaza in two, the Israelis pushed further into Gaza City, where they faced resistance from Hamas. While Israeli forces have since conducted ground operations across much of northern Gaza, there are still clashes in some areas, analysts from the Institute for the Study of War. The image below, released by the IDF, shows tanks and armoured bulldozers on the beach near Gaza City. A photo of the same beach from last summer shows people making the most of a hot day in Gaza, families splashing in the sea or sitting on fanning out along the beach.

SNP accuses Lindsay Hoyle of 'effectively lying' over Gaza debatePublished5 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The SNP's Westminster leader has accused the Speaker of ""effectively lying"" over the possibility of an emergency Gaza debate. Last week an SNP debate on Gaza descended into chaos after a decision over voting by Sir Lindsay Hoyle. He apologised and offered the possibility of a second debate this week - beforerejecting that bid. The Speaker's Office explained the decision was due to a ministerial statement on the same issue. Mr Flynn told BBC Radio Scotland: ""Unfortunately, the Speaker of the House of Commons (has) broken the rules and now broke his word and effectively lied, not just to SNP MPs but the entire parliamentary chamber and indeed the public last Thursday. ""I don't think anyone can be in any position where they don't find that deeply, deeply challenging, given the Speaker of the House of Commons is there to effectively ensure that democracy runs smoothly on these isles."" A spokesperson from Speaker's Office referred to Sir Lindsay's statement in the Commons on Monday, when he explained his reasoning. He said: ""In determining whether a matter is urgent, I must have regard to the probability of the matter being brought before the House in time by other means. The House came to a resolution on this matter on Wednesday last week. ""Further, I understand that the government are ready to make a relevant statement tomorrow, so there is a very imminent opportunity for this important matter to come before the House. ""That is why I decided that the application for an emergency debate should not proceed."" The furore started last week, when the Speaker decided to allow a Labour amendment to an SNP motion on Gaza to go to a vote, effectively denying the SNP the chance to vote on their own motion. Sir Lindsay apologised the same day, insisting his priority was the safety of MPs, which he believes to be under threat over this issue. But anger in the ranks of SNP and Conservative MPs saw them band together to sign an Early Day Motion of no confidence in the Speaker. It now stands at 81 signatures. Under mounting pressure to quit, Sir Lindsay offered the SNP the option of an emergency debate, known as an SO24, alongside another apology. However, he later turned down the SNP's request for that emergency debate, now saying a statement from the government on Tuesday would be sufficient. An update on Israel and Gaza is being made to MPs by Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell, who said calling for a ceasefire would not be enough to make one happen and re-stated the government's position. ""We are trying to negotiate an immediate pause in order that we can get the hostages out and get incredibly badly-needed aid in, leading to a sustainable ceasefire,"" he said. Shadow Foreign Office minister David Lammy called for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire now"", which he said should be a ""truce in exchange for hostages... by Ramadan"". SNP foreign affairs spokesperson Brendan O'Hara accused Israel of ""ethnic cleansing and collective punishment"" and the UK government of ""complete dereliction of all moral and legal responsibility"". In response, Mr Mitchell rejected the claims and said ""the central aim of all us is to bring about a ceasefire"" and that, ""beneath the sound and fury"" of Mr O'Hara's statement ""there is more substantial agreement between his party and the government than he is recognising"".",2024-02-27T15:22:27.000Z

""We know for sure he was kidnapped,"" his son Matitold the BBC. Alex - whose older sister Edith is a Holocaust survivor - has spent the last 30 years working for Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust remembrance centre.

Idan Shtivi, 28, an environmental sciences student, was attending the festival to take pictures at music and yoga workshops being held by friends. He escaped the site in his car but was attacked by Hamas along the route. The bodies of two of his passengers were found, and his family told the Jerusalem Post they suspect he was kidnapped.

According to Israel's foreign ministry he is being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. Eitan Mor, 23, lives in Jerusalem, and was working as a security guard at the festival, the Times of Israel said. He reportedly texted his uncle after Hamas arrived and was last seen with a friend bringing others to safety. Alon Ohel, 22, a Serbian citizen, took refuge in a shelter after the festival came under attack, his family say. They have seen footage of him being dragged away after a grenade attack. Almog Meir Jan, 21, tried to flee the festival. He and a friend made it to the friend's car but only managed to drive a short distance before being forced to stop. Almog's family say they have seen a hostage video in which he appears. Inbar Heiman, a student aged 21, was seen by two young Israeli men being taken away from the festival on a motorcycle. Hamas have released a video in which she is seen very briefly. Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, a dual US-Israeli citizen, was badly injured in the attack, his family told the BBC. Eyewitness accounts say  he was seen being forced onto a white pick-up truck - the last-known signal from his phone came from just inside Gaza.

Orión Hernández Radoux, 30, from Mexico, attended the festival with his girlfriend, Shani Louk. He has not been seen since. The Sun newspaper says it has seen threatening messages written in Arabic sent from his phone. Shani, a German citizen, was initially thought to be among those seized. But on 30 October, her mother Ricarda told German media that the family had been informed by Israeli military of her death following DNA identification. Romi Lesham Gonen, 23, was on the phone to her mother as she tried to escape from the Supernova festival. Merav Leshem Gonan has recounted a conversation in which her daughter begged for help after being shot. ABC News reports that Romi's phone is now in Gaza.

Later the same day, his family say they identified him in a video of Israeli prisoners, posted by Hamas. Since then, they say they have had no further information. Eliya Cohen, 26, was hiding with his girlfriend Ziv from the attack, when Ziv felt him being pulled up and driven away by the gunmen, Eliya's mother has told the video initiative #BringThemHomeNow. The family then found a photo of Eliya in Gaza, the Times of Israel reported. Amit Buskila, 28, from Ashdod, was last heard of making a call to her uncle, Shimon, as Hamas overran the festival. Her family say they have now been told by the government that she is being held in Gaza. Carmel Gat,39, is Jordan's sister-in-law, and also was seen by her father being taken by gunmen from Kibbutz Be'eri, Haaretz newspaper reported. She has not been heard from since. Ohad Yahalomi,49, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during the November ceasefire.

On Saturday 25 November Dror's son Noam,17, and daughter Alma, 13, were released from captivity.

His wife Adi, also 38, her mother Dr Shoshan Haran, 67, were released by Hamas on 25 November, along with the couple's children Nave, eight, and Yahel, three. Dr Haran's husband, Avshalom - an economist and dual German/Israeli citizen - was killed on 7 October. Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, an American-Israeli citizen, has been missing since Hamas's attack on Nir Oz, his father Jonathan told the BBC. He said his son was not found among the dead and the ""only reasonable explanation"" is that he was taken to Gaza. Thailand's ambassador to Israel says 26 of its citizens were taken hostage, 23 of whom have now been released. Those still being held are believed to includeWatchara Sriuan,32. His mother, Viewwaew, told the Thaiger news site that the family had been informed he was being held captive. Kiattisak ""Top"" Pateeand aMr Pongtorn (no first name given)have also been named by the Thai foreign ministry as hostages. A number of other people thought to have been held hostage are now confirmed to have died, either during the 7 October attack or while in captivity. On 16 December, the Israeli military expressed ""deep remorse"" after soldiers mistakenly killed three hostages in northern Gaza who had escaped from their captors. They were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26. The death of Tamir Adar, 38, was announced on 5 January by the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. Other hostages recently confirmed to have died include Gadi Haggai, Ron Scherman, Nik Beizer, Tal Chaimi, an Israeli-Romanian citizen aged 41, Joshua Mollel, a 19-year-old Tanzanian student, 27-year-old Eden Zecharya, and 36-year-old Ziv Dado.

Israel-Gaza war: MPs call for protest organisers to give longer notice periodPublished5 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Home Office should consider making protest organisers give a longer notice period to allow the police to better prepare, MPs have said. The Home Affairs select committee is calling on the government to give the police more support, as marches continue over the Israel-Gaza war. It cites the Met Police as saying it is under the ""greatest period of sustained pressure"" since the 2012 Olympics. Under current rules, organisers must give six days notice of a public march. Large demonstrations have been taking place across the UK since the 7 October attacks on Israel by Hamas and Israel began its military assault in response to destroy the group in Gaza. The cross-party committee of MPs issued a report in which it found that policing the protests between 7 October and 17 December last year cost forces nationwide more than £25m. It also found that demonstrations, and the ""disruptive tactics"" of some participants, were causing ""unsustainable pressure"" on policing resources. ""Should these protests continue indefinitely, it stands to reason that forces will be less able to carry out the everyday neighbourhood and response policing that is so vital to the public,"" the report said. ""If the protests continue to take place as frequently at this scale, the Home Office should consider amending requirements for protest organisers, such as increasing the notice period for protest organisers to inform the police from the current six days, to allow the police to prepare better."" MPs also highlight that during a three-month period, more than 4,000 officer rest days were cancelled to ensure the protests could be policed safely. The committee criticises the government for a lack of action on the rise in hate crime as a result of the conflict in the Middle East. It also says the hate crime action plan expired four years ago and accuses ministers of not responding to reports on the issue. The committee also expressed concern over protests outside the homes and offices of MPs. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that at least 29,782 people, mostly women and children, have been killed since the war began in October. Israel's military offensive was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on 7 October in which gunmen killed about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and took 253 back to Gaza as hostages. The Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) says the report fails to address ""the increasingly urgent need to... ensure the safety of this country's Jewish community"". ""The committee has rightly acknowledged the immediate and severe threat posed to their MP colleagues by intimidation and violent attacks but, despite having extensively quoted our evidence in their report, they do not appear to have treated the threat to the Jewish community with the same degree of alarm,"" a spokesman says. He adds that the call for protest organisers to give more notice ""would not change the actual nature of these marches and therefore solves nothing other than timesheet planning for our overstretched police forces"". Under the Public Order Act 1986, police must be notified at least six days before a public march is intended to take place. The committee report does not detail the precise notice period it is recommending. The BBC has contacted the Home Office for comment.",2024-02-27T06:00:43.000Z

Aaron Bushnell: US airman dies after setting himself on fire outside Israeli embassy in WashingtonPublished6 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A US airman has died after setting himself on fire in front of the Israeli embassy in Washington DC on Sunday, shouting ""free Palestine"". Aaron Bushnell, 25, was taken to hospital after Secret Service officers extinguished the flames. Before setting himself alight in what he called an ""extreme act of protest"", he said he would ""no longer be complicit in genocide"". No embassy staff members were injured, a spokeswoman said. A Pentagon spokesman called the incident, which happened at 13:00 local time (18:00 GMT), a ""tragic event"". In a video aired live on streaming site Twitch, Mr Bushnell, who was dressed in military uniform, identified himself and said he was a serving member of the Air Force. Earlier, he had emailed a number of reporters as well as left-wing and anarchist news websites. The Atlanta Community Press Collective, one of the groups that received the email, provided a copy to the BBC. ""Today, I am planning to engage in an extreme act of protest against the genocide of the Palestinian people,"" the email read, warning it would be ""highly disturbing"". Mr Bushnell was taken to the hospital in a critical condition. A bomb disposal unit was sent to the site over concerns about a suspicious vehicle that could have been connected to the individual. This was declared safe after no hazardous materials were found. Washington police said officers were working with the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to investigate the incident. Mr Bushnell, of San Antonio, Texas, was raised in Massachusetts and attended public schools on the Cape Cod peninsula, according to a statement from a local school district. The Air Force would not confirm details of Mr Bushnell's service, citing family notification policies but Stars and Stripes, a military newspaper, reported that he had held the rank of senior airman. In his Linkedin profile, Mr Bushnell stated that he had graduated from Air Force basic training ""top of class"" in November 2020 and that he had been seeking ""to transition out of the US Air Force into software engineering"". The Israel-Gaza war erupted on 7 October last year when Hamas gunmen infiltrated southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 253 others hostage. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which 29,300 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. In an interview with CBS News on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the offensive in the face of international criticism, saying America would be ""doing a hell of a lot more"" if it had suffered such an attack. It is not the first time someone has set themselves on fire in front of an Israeli diplomatic mission in the US since the intensification of the conflict. In December,a protester self-immolated in front of the Israeli consulatein the US state of Georgia. A Palestinian flag found at the scene was part of the protest, police said.",2024-02-26T23:14:23.000Z

'Who will call me Dad?' Tears of Gaza father who lost 103 relativesPublished6 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Ahmad al-Ghuferi missed the bomb that obliterated his family. When 103 relatives were killed in a strike on their family home in Gaza City, he was stuck 50 miles (80km) away, in the occupied West Bank town of Jericho. Ahmad had been working on a Tel Aviv construction site when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October - unable to return to his wife and three young daughters because of the war that followed, and Israel's military blockade. He spoke to them at the same time every day, when the phone connections allowed, and was on the phone to his wife, Shireen, as the attack happened on the evening of 8 December. ""She knew she would die,"" he said. ""She told me to forgive her for anything bad she might ever have done to me. I told her there was no need to say that. And that was the last call between us."" A large bomb attack on his uncle's house that evening killed his wife and his three young daughters - Tala, Lana and Najla. It also killed Ahmad's mother, four of his brothers and their families, as well as dozens of his aunts, uncles and cousins. More than 100 dead in all. Over two months on, some of their bodies are still trapped under the rubble. Last week, he marked his youngest daughter's birthday. Najla would have turned two. Ahmad is still trying to grasp the loss. Unable to hold his children's bodies or be at their hurried burials, he still speaks of them in the present tense, his face motionless beneath the rolling tears. ""My daughters are little birds to me,"" he said. ""I feel like I'm in a dream. I still can't believe what's happened to us."" He has removed pictures of the girls from his phone and laptop screens, so as not to be ambushed by them. He has been left to piece together the story of what happened from the accounts of a few surviving relatives and neighbours. They told him that a missile had first struck the entrance to his family's house. ""They hurried out and went to my uncle's house nearby,"" he said. ""Fifteen minutes later, a fighter jet hit that house."" The four-storey building where the family was killed sat around the corner from the Sahaba Medical Centre in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood. It is now a mound of splintered concrete, the rubble shot through with bright dots of colour: a green plastic cup, shreds of dusty clothing. The crumpled frame of a silver car, its windscreen twisted into a grimace, sits nearby under overhanging concrete rocks. One of Ahmad's surviving relatives, Hamid al-Ghuferi, told the BBC that when the strikes began, those who ran away up the hill survived, and those who sheltered in the house were killed. ""It was a fire-belt,"" he said. ""There were strikes on the four houses next to ours. They were hitting a house every 10 minutes."" ""110 people from the Ghuferi family were there - our children and relatives,"" he said. ""All but a handful of them were killed."" Survivors say the eldest victim was a 98-year-old grandmother; the youngest a baby boy born just nine days earlier. Another relative, a cousin who is also called Ahmad, described two big explosions from an air strike. ""There was no advance warning,"" he said. ""If [some] people hadn't already left this area, I think hundreds would have been killed. The area looks totally different now. There was a car park, a place to store water, and three houses plus one big house. The blast obliterated a whole residential area."" Hamid said the survivors had worked until the early hours of the morning to retrieve the bodies from the rubble. ""Airplanes were hovering in the sky, and quadcopters were firing at us as we were trying to pull them out,"" the cousin Ahmad said. ""We were sitting in the house and we found ourselves under the rubble,"" Umm Ahmad al-Ghuferi told the BBC. ""I was thrown from one side to the other. I don't know how they got me out. We saw death in front of our eyes."" Two and a half months on, they're still trying to reach some of the bodies buried beneath the rubble. The family have collected money to hire a small digger, to chip away at the debris. ""We retrieved four bodies [today],"" Ahmad told the BBC, ""including my brother's wife and my nephew Mohammed, who was pulled out in pieces. They had been under the rubble for 75 days."" Their temporary graves lie in a piece of empty land nearby, marked by sticks and plastic sheeting. Ahmad, stuck in Jericho, has not visited them. ""What did I do to be deprived of my mum, my wife, my children and my brothers?"" he asked. ""They were all civilians."" We asked the Israeli army about the family's allegations that it was targeted by air strikes. In response, the army said it was not aware of the strike in question, and that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took ""feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm"" in its war with Hamas. There was intense fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas gunmen in the area of Shejaiyya, a few blocks south of the al-Ghuferi house, in the days immediately before and after Ahmad's family were killed. In a daily update on 9 December, the army said that it had ""identified a number of terrorists armed with anti-tank missiles"" approaching troops in Shejaiyya, and called in a helicopter strike on them. It also said fighter jets had been striking terror targets in the Gaza Strip, as ground operations continued. The area of Zeitoun, where the family house once stood, is now the focus of fresh operations by the IDF. Stuck in Jericho with his father - another construction worker trapped in the West Bank -  Ahmad still sometimes calls his surviving relatives in Gaza. But after months of being trapped outside his beloved home and desperate to return, he is no longer sure if he will ever go back. ""My dream was shattered in Gaza,"" he said. ""Who should I go back for? Who will call me Dad? Who will call me darling? My wife used to tell me I was all her life. Who will tell me that now?""",2024-02-26T21:01:00.000Z

Palestinian Authority PM Shtayyeh resigns citing new 'reality' in GazaPublished6 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh has resigned along with his government, which runs parts of the occupied West Bank. Mr Shtayyeh said new ""arrangements"" were needed to take account of the ""emerging reality in the Gaza Strip"". President Mahmoud Abbas accepted his decision, which could pave the way for a technocratic government. Mr Abbas is under pressure from the US to reform the PA so it could govern Gaza after the Israel-Hamas war ends. Last week, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a vision for the territory that made no mention of any role for the PA. The Israeli military launched a large-scale air and ground campaign in Gaza after Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel on 7 October and took 253 other people hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 29,782 people have been killed in the territory since then, including 90 in the past 24 hours. Mr Shtayyeh, an economist who has been in office since 2019, announced his government's resignation at a cabinet meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday morning. He explained that the decision ""comes in light of the political, security, and economic developments related to the aggression against Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, and the unprecedented escalation in the West Bank, including the city of Jerusalem"",according to the official Wafa news agency. ""I see that the next stage and its challenges require new governmental and political arrangements that take into account the emerging reality in the Gaza Strip, the national unity talks, and the urgent need for an inter-Palestinian consensus based on a national basis, broad participation, unity of ranks, and the extension of the Palestinian Authority's sovereignty over the entire land of Palestine,"" he added. Mr Abbas asked Mr Shtayyeh and his cabinet to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed. His preferred candidate for the premiership is believed to be Mohammed Mustafa, a US-educated economist and former senior World Bank official who is chairman of the Palestine Investment Fund. He could be tasked with forming a new government of expert ministers not aligned to any factions, in the hope that Israel could be persuaded to let them govern Gaza after the war. The PA, which was established in 1994 under the Oslo accords, has limited governance powers in parts of the occupied West Bank not under full Israeli control and is dominated by Mr Abbas's Fatah movement, Hamas's rival. It lost control of Gaza in 2007, when Hamas ousted forces loyal to Mr Abbas a year after winning the last Palestinian elections, and is deeply unpopular among many Palestinians, both in the West Bank and Gaza. In November, US President Joe Biden said Gaza and the West Bank ""should be reunited under a single governance structure, ultimately under a revitalised Palestinian Authority, as we all work toward a two-state solution"". Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a reformed PA had to ""meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people and deliver for them"", including by combating corruption, engaging civil society and supporting media freedom. Mr Netanyahu's plan for post-war Gaza, which he presented to ministers on Thursday, does not rule out a role for the PA. But it also does not specifically mention the body either. It instead talks about handing responsibility for civilian management and public order to ""local elements with managerial experience"", who would ""not be identified with countries or entities that support terrorism and will not receive payment from them"". It also envisages a completely ""demilitarised"" Gaza, with Israel staying in charge of security for the foreseeable future. A spokesman for Mr Abbas said the plan was doomed to fail.",2024-02-26T18:47:12.000Z

Lindsay Hoyle rejects SNP request for emergency Gaza debatePublished6 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has rejected the SNP's request for an emergency debate on Gaza. Sir Lindsay said he understood the government was ""ready to make a relevant statement"" on Tuesday so there were other opportunities for MPs to discuss the issue. It comes after last week's debate on SNP calls for an immediate ceasefire in the conflictended in chaos. The SNP said Westminster was ""failing the people of Gaza by blocking a vote"". The party had requested a fresh debate on a motion which would mandate the government to take concrete steps to make a ceasefire happen, including using its position on the United Nations Security Council to vote for an immediate ceasefire and halting the sale of arms to Israel. However, the Speaker said that under Commons rules an emergency debate had to be on an issue ministers had responsibility for, and there must be no other way MPs could discuss it. Sir Lindsay told MPs the SNP's application for a debate did not meet either criteria. ""That decision, of course, does not mean that members cannot apply for a debate at a later stage when circumstances might have changed,"" he added. In response, SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said in a statement: ""For months, the UK Parliament has blocked SNP calls for an immediate ceasefire - and now it's blocking a vote on the concrete actions the UK government must pursue to make an immediate ceasefire more likely."" He said the ""inexplicable decision"" would ""further erode trust in the Speaker"". Sir Lindsay provoked anger from SNP and Conservative MPs when he broke with convention last week to allow a vote on a Labour amendment to the SNP's motion calling for an immediate ceasefire. It meant the SNP's motion, which was originally meant to be the focus of the debate, was not voted on. This led to calls from the SNP - and some Conservatives - for Sir Lindsay to resign. Since then, the number of MPs declaring no confidence in him as Speakerhas risen to 80. Sir Lindsay, who has already apologised for his handling of the issue, had previously indicated he would allow a fresh debate under emergency rules. Mr Flynn said: ""The Speaker broke the rules last week - and this week he has broken his word. ""How can MPs have any trust in the Speaker when he makes a public commitment one minute, only to rip it up the next."" Last week, Sir Lindsay had argued that allowing a vote on Labour's amendment meant MPs could express their views on the ""widest range of propositions"",  helping to protect them from threats to their safety amid heightened scrutiny over their stance on the conflict. However, the decision meant Labour avoided a potentially damaging rebellion over whether it supported the SNP's ceasefire call, which went further by calling for an end to the ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"". This led to accusations, which have been denied by the party and Sir Lindsay, that Labour had put pressure on the Speaker over the decision.",2024-02-26T17:07:52.000Z

Charlotte Church denies antisemitism after pro-Palestinian chantPublished6 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Charlotte Church says she is ""in no way antisemitic"" after being criticised for taking part in a controversial pro-Palestinian chant. The singer faced backlash after she led a 100-strong choir in a rendition of From the River to the Sea at a concert. It references the land between the River Jordan, bordering the occupied West Bank and Israel in the east, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. Critics say it calls for the destruction of the state of Israel. The Palestine Solidarity Campaign and other activists contest this, saying the slogan refers to ""the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice"". Broadcasting live on Instagram on Monday, Church addressed ""alarmist"" reports relating to the event. She said: ""Just to clarify my intentions there, I am in no way antisemitic. I am fighting for the liberation of all people. I have a deep heart for all religions and all difference. ""It was a beautiful, beautiful event. But unfortunately the powers that be can't have that. [They] can't have such a powerful symbol of resistance as what we worked towards on Saturday."" Church confirmed the gig had ended with a chant of the words ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"". She said: ""Clearly, if you know the history of it all, [it is] not an antisemitic chant calling for the obliteration of Israel. It is not that in any way shape or form. It is calling for the peaceful coexistence of Israelis and Palestinians."" Church said ""lots of other beautiful songs… of liberation and freedom"" were performed at the event, including Arabic songs, Welsh songs, and South African songs from the anti-Apartheid movement, ""the lyrics of which were adapted to the situation in Palestine"". The Campaign Against Antisemitism has previously said the ""River to the Sea"" chant is deeply offensive and threatening. It accused the singer of ""anti-Jewish racism"" and has called for the Charity Commission to investigate. Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain MBE said on X: ""Dear Charlotte Church: Let me translate for you - when you say 'From the river to the sea' it means expelling Jews from the Jordan to the Mediterranean i.e. from the Land of Israel entirely & destroying a nation."" However, the Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), a US group which calls itself a ""progressive Jewish anti-Zionist"" organisation, includes a version of the chant in its mission statement: ""We picture Palestinians — from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea — living with their inalienable rights respected."" Church has not shied away from expressing her political views since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war. Last month, ina statement posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, she said she was ""in tears daily"" over the situation and felt she must ""do more to organise, resist, oppose, fight like a lioness"" for the Palestinians. The event took place on Saturday, 24 February at Bedwas Workmen's Hall, Caerphilly county, to raise money for Middle East Children's Alliance, which supports children in Gaza. Church was joined by Palestine Solidarity Cymru and 100 singers. Church has been contacted for comment.",2024-02-26T16:18:24.000Z

SNP to push for fresh Gaza debate after Commons vote chaosPublished6 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The SNP says it will push for another Commons debate on Gaza following the chaotic vote on the conflict on Wednesday. There was uproar in the Commons when Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle allowed MPs to vote on a Labour amendment to the SNP's ceasefire motion. It meant the SNP motion was not voted on, prompting the party to say Sir Lindsay should quit as Speaker. The SNP now says it will apply for another debate on the issue this week. Sir Lindsay, who hasapologised for his handling of the debate, has already indicated he would allow a fresh debate under emergency rules. This could prove awkward for Labour, which has beenplagued by divisionover its stance on the Israel-Hamas war. Labour has been accused of having warned Sir Lindsay that he would lose the party's support for him continuing as Speaker after a general election, if he did not allow a vote on its amendment. But the party denies such claims. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Labour shadow minister Lisa Nandy said she could assure people that no one from her party had threatened Sir Lindsay. ""The idea that any political leader or any politician of any party could threaten the House of Commons Speaker and get away with it is just absolute nonsense,"" Ms Nandy said. ""I certainly didn't, the chief whip didn't, the leader of the Labour party didn't,"" she added. However, it is unclear whether another debate will allow the SNP to force a vote that drives a wedge between other parties on the issue. In a statement, it said it wanted to have an emergency debate on a motion setting out ""concrete actions"" the UK could take to promote a ceasefire at the United Nations. The party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said this would allow MPs to ""move the debate forward"" by putting pressure on the government to take a firmer pro-ceasefire stance. The SNP said it wanted to do this through a little-used Commons procedure that allows emergency debates to take place at short notice. But Commons rules suggest the process allows only for a vote on a neutral motion, where MPs simply state they have generally considered an issue rather than making a decision. The SNP will have to formally apply for the debate after the Commons returns on Monday, potentially prompting fresh scrutiny over Sir Lindsay's handling of Commons procedure. Ahead of last Wednesday's debate, the SNP motion called for an ""immediate ceasefire""; Labour demanded an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", while the government had also tabled its own amendment calling for an ""immediate humanitarian pause"". Both Conservatives and SNP MPs were angered by the speaker who broke with convention and allowed a vote on a Labour amendment. The government then withdrew from taking part in the vote in protest, meaning Labour's amendment was waved through and the SNP's motion - which was meant to be the entire focus of the day - wasn't formally voted on at all. Sir Lindsay argued that letting MPs vote on a wider range of positions would protect them from threats to their safety, amid heightened scrutiny of their stance on the conflict. But it allowed Labour to sidestep a potentially damaging rebellion over whether it supported the wording of the SNP's ceasefire call, which also criticised the ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"". Labour's own amendment supported a ceasefire but noted that Israel ""cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence"". This prompted accusations Sir Lindsay had played ""party politics"" with the vote, with 77 MPs since declaring no confidence in him as speaker. The SNP said it would hold discussions with Sir Lindsay before publishing the motion it wants to see debated. He has already said he backs the idea of holding a further debate. However, if the SNP tables a motion detailing a range of specific demands on the government, it could put Sir Lindsay in an awkward position. His predecessor, John Bercow, prompted an outcry in 2019 by allowing MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit to use such an emergency debate to take control of the Commons timetable. This was seen as another controversial break with convention, by allowing an emergency debate to pave the way for MPs to make a binding decision.",2024-02-26T15:22:55.000Z

How the Gaza conflict is contorting UK politicsPublished6 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The two biggest political parties at Westminster and Parliament itself are finding themselves buckled, bent and contorted by the furious arguments provoked by the Israel-Gaza war. For the Conservatives, theLee Anderson rowabout Islamophobia. For Parliament, the Commons Speakerrow about a ceasefire and parliamentary procedure. And for Labour, the Rochdale row about antisemitism and theby-election there in a few days. The prime minister's week began with a trio of BBC local radio interviews, where alongside questions about spending on transport projects in the north of England he wasinevitably asked about his former deputy chairman's remarks. It's only a few weeks back that Rishi Sunak and Mr Anderson were doing ajoint campaign video. Now Mr Sunak is distancing himself from Mr Anderson. But the prime minister, like his deputy, is not describing what Lee Anderson said as Islamophobic. In fact, a row about that very word has broken out within the Conservative Party, withformer chairman Baroness Warsi at loggerheadswith the Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch over it. Next, the Speaker of the Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle starts the week with the third biggest party, the SNP, saying it doesn't have confidence in him. And Conservative MPs' WhatsApp groups are inflamed too, I hear, the sentiment of many being ""how can we ever trust him again?"" As it stands, 72 MPs have signed aCommons motion saying he should go. This may all mean Sir Lindsay concludes he has no option but to address the issue - either by standing down or saying he will at the election. But the pressure on him seems to have eased a little - or not got worse - for now at least. The SNP's focus is on securing a debate where they can shift the dial on the government's approach to the Israel-Hamas war. They want one under what is known asstanding order 24. It only allows for the Commons to consider something, rather than vote on a substantive question, which is what the SNP want. Which leaves the Speaker in a bind: fail to give them what they want, or bend parliamentary conventions again - which is what got him into trouble in the first place. Meanwhile, I hear some of the smaller parties have been comparing notes on how they feel they are treated by the Speaker and will see him later to set out their argument too. And then there is Labour. The Rochdale by-election is on Thursday and the party that aspires to be in government before the year is out is a mere bystander, a spectator - after their candidate was accused of antisemitism and the party disowned him. What we are seeing is a noisy, angry mess on three fronts and two big central questions: what is it legitimate to say about different communities or religious groups? And, in an election year, is it in the interests of our political parties to seek to calm things down, or crank things up? Right now, the evidence suggests the latter.",2024-02-26T13:00:34.000Z

"Red Sea attacks delaying goods and pushing up costs, firms sayPublished6 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","British firms say they are facing higher shipping costs and delays of up to four weeks due to Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, a business group said. More than a third of the firms surveyed by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said they had been affected. That figure rose to more than half among exporters responding to the survey. The added costs could contribute to higher prices in the UK economy generally, the BCC warned. ""There has been spare capacity in the shipping-freight industry to respond to the difficulties, which has bought us some time,"" William Bain, BCC head of trade policy, said. However, speaking to the BBC's Today programme he said: ""The pressures are getting higher and higher and there's only so long that costs can be absorbed... [The scale of price rises] is not as high as the pandemic - but these cannot be kept away from prices for long."" Exporters, retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers were more likely than other firms to be feeling the impact, the BCC found, leaving some short of goods to sell to customers and components for production lines, or facing cashflow difficulties. Rerouting shipments around the southern tip of Africa, the Cape of Good Hope, was adding an extra three to four weeks to delivery times, the BCC said, with some firms citing price rises of more than 300% for container hire, it said. Rachael Waring, managing director of Warings Furniture which imports interior decor for pubs and restaurants, said the conflict had been affecting her business since before Christmas. ""We have had to budget for extra costs, because the quotes we're getting for containers have been considerably higher,"" she told the BBC's Wake Up To Money. She is also offering clients extra services to make up for delays. But she hopes to counteract some of the cost increases by negotiating lower prices with the Chinese manufacturers she sources from, and avoid further price rises for customers if she can. The BCC, which represents more than 50,000 businesses across its network, said given the circumstances it would like to see extra government support for exporters, including the formation of an exports council to promote trade. ""The UK economy saw a drop in its total goods exports for 2023, and with global demand weak, there is a need for the government to look at providing support in the March Budget,"" Mr Bain said. He said that small businesses like Rachael's would be finding things more difficult than larger companies, and suggested the government could help by reforming business rates, for example, to help them through ""these difficult times in trade"". Shipping rates have increased after Houthis attacked commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea following the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict in October. The Iran-backed group said it was targeting ships linked to Israel, the US and the UK in support of Hamas. The US and the UK have responded with air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. The Red Sea is the fastest sea route between Asia and Europe. Large shipping firms, including Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, have diverted vessels to the much longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope and then up the west side of the continent. But that has pushed up costs, including for insurance, as well as creating delays. Earlier this month one of the UK'sbest known tea brands,Tetley, warned supplies were ""much tighter"" than it would like and rival Yorkshire Tea said it was also monitoring the situation closely. The BCC heard from more than 1,000 firms in their annual survey, which took place between 15 January and 9 February. Of those responding 90% were small firms, with fewer than 250 employees.",2024-02-26T09:53:43.000Z

Gaza children searching for food to keep families alivePublished7 days agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"In certain places at certain times, just staying alive is something for a boy to be proud of - let alone going out every day to find the food that keeps your family from starving. Every morning, Mohammed Zo'rab, 11, goes out into the southern Gaza city of Rafah on a mission. He takes a big plastic bowl and heads to schools that have become refugee centres, and to makeshift camps on the roadside where people suffer like his own family but might still find something to feed the child of strangers. Mohammed also goes to hospitals where the wounded arrive at all hours, and anywhere else where there might be a pot boiling over an open fire. ""When I go back to my family with this food, they get happy and we all eat together,"" he says. ""Sometimes I go empty handed and I feel sad."" Mohammed is the eldest of four children and lives with his mother, father and his siblings in a flimsy shelter made of plastic and tarpaulin. His father, Khaled, roams around Rafah looking for odd jobs to raise five shekels (about $1.38; £1.08) to buy nappies for their two-month-old daughter, Howaida. Mohammed is one of thousands of children who have become primary food gatherers for their families. ""When the line is crowded and there are almost 100 people in front of me, I sneak between people,"" he says, proud of his skill at navigating large crowds without getting into fights. Back at home, he hands the bowl of baked beans to his mother, Samar, who distributes the food to the other children. She is gaunt and barely eats herself. ""I have cancer in my bones,"" she reveals. ""I am 31-years-old but when you see me you think I'm 60. I can't walk. ""If I walk, I get very tired. All my body hurts and I need treatment and nutrition."" Like so many others, Samar and her family came to Rafah from their home further north in Khan Younis because the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told them it would be safe. That was three months ago. Since then, the war has come steadily closer to Rafah. More than 70 people were killed less than a fortnight ago when Israel launched a raid to rescue two hostages being held by Hamas. The Zo'rab family's shelter leaks and the floor fills with rain. Sometimes, baby Howaida has no fresh diapers. Each day offers relentless indignities in a place where 1.5 million people - five times the normal population - are crammed next to the Egyptian border. With 85% of Gaza's population now displaced, the amount of aid getting into the enclave is nowhere near what is needed. According to the United Nations (UN), five hundred trucks of aid per day are required. The daily average has been ninety. The situation in northern Gaza is particularly acute. Israel says the UN is failing to distribute aid in the north and that aid supplies are backed up - waiting to be collected on the Gaza side of the border. The organisation has suspended movement of food aid in northern Gaza because it says there is no protection for truck drivers, who have faced attack by criminal gangs and looting by desperate people. One truck was hit by shellfire, which the UN says came from an Israeli naval craft. In addition, the Hamas-run police force in Gaza is no longer willing to escort food trucks because they fear being shot by the IDF. In Israel, the military conduct of the war is still supported by a large majority. There is no discernible body of opinion that supports stepping up the aid effort for civilians in Gaza. In one recent poll, 68% of Jewish respondents said they opposed the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza while Hamas still held Israeli hostages. By contrast Arab Israelis polled were 85% in favour of aid. Zvika Mor, whose eldest son, Eitan, is a hostage in Gaza, speaks of a boy who was the ""first person to call me Daddy"" and of how much he, his wife and their other seven children miss the young man kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October. Eitan was acting as an unarmed security guard at the Nova music festival, where Hamas killed an estimated 360 people in and around the area. Mr Mor heads a small group of hostage families that want their loved ones returned before any negotiations with Hamas. They are opposed to the government doing a deal that would make this conditional on a ceasefire, increase in humanitarian aid in Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. ""Israel makes [a] humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Because our purpose is to release our people,"" Mr Mor says. ""We want our people, okay? And first of all, before all the negotiations and other things, give us our people."" Asked if this was not harsh, given that it was the lives of Gaza civilians that were at stake, Mr Mor replies: ""Yes, but we have babies and women and, and the elders, okay? ""It's very, very simple. Give us our people and we will give you food and medicines. So simple."" In Gaza, charities are using what is left of their food resources to provide some assistance. Mahmoud Al-Quishawi of the US-based charity Pious Projects of America was standing close to the boiling pots of beans where Mohammed received food for his family. ""We are trying tirelessly every day to extend a helping hand to these people… to tell them 'we are with you, we won't let you stand alone',"" says Mr Al-Quishawi. The charity has run out of bottled gas to heat the food, so volunteers gather wood and keep fires burning. ""The atmosphere is gloomy,"" he says. ""The situation is catastrophic."" In northern Gaza, there have been reports of children dying from malnutrition. The British charity Action Aid cited a doctor in northern Gaza as saying that a significant number of children had died. In a video recording, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya - the head of paediatrics at the Kamal Adwan Hospital - said malnutrition was widespread, as well as infections of the digestive system. According to Action Aid, one in six children under the age of two ""who were screened at IDP [internally displaced persons] shelters and health centres in January were found to be acutely malnourished"". That, says the charity, represents a ""decline in a population's nutritional status that is unprecedented globally in three months."" Another medic at Al-Shifa Medical Complex, also in northern Gaza, said he had treated a two-month-old boy named Mahmoud Fatouh, who died soon after arriving at the hospital. ""This child could not be provided with milk. His mum was not provided with food to be able to breastfeed him,"" says Dr Amjad Aliwa. ""He had symptoms of severe dehydration, and he was taking his last breaths [when he came]"". In Gaza, the civilians are stranded where war and hunger have trapped them.

Israel mulls ceasefire plan as progress reportedPublished25 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel's war cabinet has been briefed on talks over a ceasefire deal in Gaza, after reports of progress made in talks in Paris on Saturday. It comes as police broke up protests in Tel Aviv calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's resignation. Riot police on horseback charged demonstrators as they tried to make their way to Democracy Square. The Paris talks are part of negotiations aimed at securing a ceasefire and the return of hostages. The deal would also see the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. On Saturday evening, the Israeli war cabinet was briefed on negotiations in Paris with mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US. ""We are working to obtain another outline for the release of our hostages,"" Mr Netanyahu wrote on X. ""That is why I sent a delegation to Paris - and tonight we will discuss the next steps in the negotiations."" Later, it was reported that Israel was sending a delegation to Qatar for further talks this week. On Sunday, White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan said an understanding of the ""basic contours"" of a hostage deal and temporary ceasefire had been reached. Anti-government demonstrations were relatively frequent in Israel before the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October - the demonstrators' loathing for Mr Netanyahu and his hardline cabinet goes back more than a year. But Saturday's unrest was the first time since October that police have resorted to tougher measures. The demonstrators have been spurred on by the war in Gaza - and the fear their government is more interested in defeating Hamas than freeing hostages. The Justice Ministry has opened an investigation into an incident in which an officer is seen - in a widely circulated video - using the reins of his horse to strike a protester as he fell to the ground clutching his head. The main opposition leader, Yair Lapid, criticised the police for their aggressive treatment of the demonstrators who gathered outside the headquarters of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The right to protest ""cannot be taken from protesters with batons and water cannons,"" he said. At least 21 arrests and dozens of injuries were reported. As well as the anti-government protest, families of the Israeli hostages gathered in the city to call for a diplomatic solution to the war and a focus on their return. Earlier on Saturday, Israeli media reported progress had been made at talks in Paris on a hostage and ceasefire deal. Israel's spy chief, David Barnea, met mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US on Saturday in the French capital. They reportedly agreed the outline of a deal to form the basis for further negotiations, which was then presented to the Israeli war cabinet on Saturday night. Israeli media report that the war cabinet agreed to send a delegation to Qatar, where they will continue talks on a deal which would see a weeks-long truce and the release of hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. But the Israeli national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said in a televised interview on Saturday evening: ""Such an agreement does not mean the end of the war."" A senior Palestinian official with close knowledge of the talks had previously told the BBC that no real progress was made in Paris and accused negotiators of leaking inaccurate information to increase pressure on Hamas. Hamas has also not commented on the latest reports of progress in reaching a deal. However, Egyptian state media said on Sunday that negotiations have resumed in Doha between ""experts from Egypt, Qatar, the United States and Israel."" The reports say Hamas representatives are also present there. Efforts to secure a ceasefire have intensified following mounting international pressure amid a desperate lack of food in Gaza. International aid agencies have warned that the entire population - 2.2 million people - is experiencing food insecurity at crisis level or above. Meanwhile fighting and air strikes continue to claim lives in the enclave. In his post on X, Mr Netanyahu said he would convene his cabinet this week to approve plans for an operation in Rafah in Gaza's far south, where around 1.2-1.5 million people are crammed into any available space. Increased Israeli air strikes there are already making aid operations more difficult. Aid agencies and many Western governments have warned that the consequences of an assault on Rafah could be dire. UNRWA - the UN agency for assisting Palestinian refugees - says it has paused aid deliveries to northern Gaza because convoys are being looted by desperate residents. One of its trucks was also hit by Israeli gunfire on 5 February. The UN has warned of the growing risk of famine in Gaza, with widely circulated footage showing Gazans in Jabalia in the north queuing for food in desperate conditions. Local media report that a two-month-old Palestinian boy died from starvation at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City on Friday. The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 29,600 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes, and thousands more bodies are likely unaccounted for under rubble across Gaza. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the 7 October attacks on southern Israeli communities near the border with Gaza, in which around 1,200 Israelis, mainly civilians, were killed and about 250 others taken hostage to Gaza.",2024-02-25T14:55:11.000Z

Gaza desperately needs more aid but agencies can’t copePublished24 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The images have been searing. Children scrabbling in the dirt, gathering handfuls of spilled flour which they stuff into their pockets. Aid trucks surrounded by angry mobs of mostly young men, who attack the drivers and make off with whatever they can carry. And young Maryam Abed-Rabu, trying but ultimately failing to stay composed as she answered a journalist's questions about the daily struggle to stay alive. A girl who has already been through so much, including the loss of her father,wailing at her inability simply to find bread. Northern Gaza is almost entirely cut off from the outside world. The population, estimated at around 300,000 people, reduced to a feral existence in a world where shops barely exist and aid never arrives. The south, meanwhile, is crammed with the displaced - hundreds of thousands of people constantly on the move, looking for food, shelter and safety. Israel says it's doing what it can to limit the suffering of civilians, but four and a half months of relentless military assault have left the Gaza Strip on its knees, with aid agencies unable to cope. ""Every time you go back it gets worse,"" Jamie McGoldrick, the UN's interim coordinator for the Palestinian territories, said on Friday. Just back from his latest visit to the Gaza Strip, he found despair was rife. ""People feel as though this is the end of their journey."" At the far southern end of the Gaza Strip, between 1.2 and 1.5 million people are crammed into every available space in and around the city of Rafah. Nearby, in the sandy coastal area known as al-Mawasi, designated by Israel as a humanitarian safe zone, at least 250,000 people are now living in flimsy accommodation with little support. Doctors working for the British medical charity UK-Med have watched a tent city springing up around them. ""Two weeks ago, there were one or two tents dotted along the beachfront,"" UK-Med's CEO David Wightwick told me on a scratchy line from his al-Mawasi base. ""They're now six tents deep."" A few miles south is the crossing point Israelis call Kerem Shalom (Karem Abu Salem in Arabic), where almost all aid destined for the Gaza Strip enters, after exhaustive Israeli checks. At a holding area on the Palestinian side, aid is offloaded and reloaded onto local trucks, for distribution throughout Gaza. The trucks traverse a 3km corridor to the ""blue gate"" at Rafah, before entering Gaza. But the collapse of security in Gaza means that for some of the aid, the journey never really begins. Trucks are attacked and looted inside the corridor. Much of the looting is by organised Palestinian gangs, with donkey carts and vehicles waiting across the fence and spotters reporting the arrival of aid. But for those trucks lucky enough to reach the blue gate, the problems have only just begun. Much of what happens next is opportunistic, and frequently violent. ""Many of these trucks, before they even get 200 metres, are stopped by cars, attacked and looted,"" Mr McGoldrick said. With just a few roads available for aid deliveries, and most convoys travelling in the early hours of the day, the UN says people are using social media to alert each other to the movement of convoys, allowing roadblocks and ambushes to be set up in advance. ""People know when we're coming,"" Mr McGoldrick said. The envoy said he had seen trucks with windows and rear-view mirrors smashed. He said he had spoken to traumatised drivers, who'd had axes thrown through their windscreens and come under fire. Rather than reaching UN warehouses and being distributed in an orderly fashion, aid often ends up being sold in street markets at vastly inflated prices which few can afford. After an UNRWA truck was hit by Israeli gunfire on 5 February, the UN was forced to suspend all aid deliveries to the north. Attempts to resume deliveries this week by the World Food Programme collapsed amid scenes of violent looting. The UN says it has approached Israel about opening up supply routes from the north but that discussions are at an early stage. The hope - a slender one at the moment - is to reduce incentives for looting by dramatically increasing the volumes of food and other essential goods entering Gaza. ""We need to flood the north with aid,"" Mr McGoldrick said, ""so it doesn't become a product that people want to use for extortionist purposes or the black market."" Israel, for its part, says it is doing what it can to facilitate the arrival of humanitarian assistance. ""We are doing everything in our power… to reduce any harmful consequences of the war [to] the civilian population,"" Col. Moshe Tetro, head of the military's coordination and liaison administration for Gaza, told reporters at a briefing this week. On Friday, the military said more than 13,000 trucks, carrying over 250,000 tons of humanitarian aid, had entered the Gaza Strip since the start of the war. That's a little over 90 trucks a day, way below the 500 UN staff say is needed to meet the growing demands of a hungry, sick, repeatedly displaced population. Israel says the problems with aid distribution are not of its making, despite the fact that the chaos reigning inside the Gaza Strip is a direct consequence of its military assault. ""Unfortunately, today and yesterday, the UN didn't show up for work,"" Col Tetro said. Delays on the Palestinian side, he said, were leading to a backlog of trucks waiting to enter Gaza. ""The UN should increase their capabilities inside Gaza."" But in recent weeks, security has been further eroded by a series of Israeli attacks on civilian police officers. According to David Satterfield, the Biden administration's envoy for humanitarian issues, such attacks had made it ""virtually impossible"" to distribute aid safely. For the UN, Israeli calls for it to do more sound hollow. The Israeli government has embarked on a campaign to dismantle UNRWA, the UN agencies which assists Palestinian refugees, following allegations that as many as 12% of the agency's 13,000 staff in Gaza were also working for Hamas, with some even participating in the murderous attacks of 7 October. The UN says it's investigating but that Israel has yet to share its intelligence. In the meantime, the Netanyahu government has already started stripping UNRWA of its functions. Responsibility for 25,000 tonnes of flour donated by the Turkish government, currently stored at the Israeli port of Ashdod, has already been transferred to the World Food Programme. In an anguished letter to the UN General Assembly on Thursday, UNRWA's director Philippe Lazzarini said the agency had reached ""breaking point"" and listed a number of measures the Israeli government was taking to hamper its work, including limiting visas for international staff, blocking an UNRWA bank account and suspending the shipment of UNRWA goods. Bad as it is at the moment, the thought of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, which the government threatens to do if Israeli hostages are not released before the start of Ramadan on 10 March, raises fears among aid workers that the worst is yet to come. UK-Med's David Wightwick has already had a glimpse. When he drove to Khan Yunis to extract a medical team from Nasser Hospital, he found himself surrounded by crowds of desperate people. ""The prospect of that happening in Rafah and al-Mawasi, where you've got hundreds of thousands of people is not one I think you really want to contemplate,"" he told me.",2024-02-24T10:45:56.000Z

Israel's PM Netanyahu lays out Gaza plan for after the warPublished23 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has laid out his vision for a post-war Gaza. Under his plan Israel would control security indefinitely, and Palestinians with no links to groups hostile to Israel would run the territory. The US, Israel's major ally, wants the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) to govern Gaza after the war. But the short document - which Mr Netanyahu presented to ministers last night - makes no mention of the PA. He has previously ruled out a post-war role for the internationally backed body. He envisages a ""demilitarised"" Gaza; Israel would be responsible for removing all military capability beyond that necessary for public order. There would be a ""Southern Closure"" on the territory's border with Egypt to prevent smuggling both under- and overground. And ""de-radicalisation"" programmes would be promoted in all religious, educational and welfare institutions. The document suggests Arab countries with experience of such programmes would be involved, though Mr Netanyahu has not specified which. Under the plan Israel would also maintain security control over the entire area west of Jordan from land, sea and air. Mr Netanyahu has been under pressure - at home and internationally - to publish proposals for Gaza since he began his military operation. He is keen to restore a crumbling reputation as a leader who can keep Israel safe and will want to appeal to right wing hardliners in his coalition government. A spokesman for Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the PA, said Mr Netanyahu's plan was doomed to fail. Nabil Abu Rudeineh said: ""If the world is genuinely interested in having security and stability in the region, it must end Israel's occupation of Palestinian land and recognise an independent Palestinian state."" Mr Netanyahu repeated his rejection of any unilateral recognition by Western countries of a Palestinian state. On Friday US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US was opposed to any reoccupation of Gaza by Israel as well as any reduction in the size of the territory. ""Gaza... cannot be a platform for terrorism. There should be no Israeli reoccupation of Gaza. The size of Gaza territory should not be reduced,"" he said at a G20 ministers meeting in Argentina. Meanwhile negotiators trying to broker a temporary ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages are expected to meet in Paris. The US wants a deal in place before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins in just over a fortnight. And, as the humanitarian situation worsens in Gaza, there is international pressure too for the war to end. The Hamas-run Ministry of Health reports that more than 29,500 people, mostly women and children, have been killed since the war began in October. Israel's military offensive was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on 7 October in which gunmen killed about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and took 253 back to Gaza as hostages. Overnight the head of the UN body responsible for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) warned that Gaza faces a ""monumental disaster with grave implications for regional peace, security and human rights"". In a letter to the president of the UN general assembly, Philippe Lazzarini said the agency ""has reached breaking point, with Israel's repeated calls to dismantle Unrwa and the freezing of funding by donors at a time of unprecedented humanitarian needs in Gaza"". Some of Unrwa's biggest donors suspended funding for the agency last month after Unrwa sacked several of its staff amid allegations by Israel that they had participated in the October attacks. Mr Netanyahu aims to close the agency as part of his post-war plan and replace it with - as yet unspecified - international aid organisations. And he has insisted that he will continue his war until Israel has dismantled Hamas and Islamic Jihad - the second largest armed group in Gaza - and all Israeli hostages are returned. At the end of 2023, Mr Netanyahu warned the war could go on for ""many more months"". Meanwhile the US has described Israel's expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank as inconsistent with international law. ""Our administration maintains a firm opposition to settlement expansion, and in our judgment this only weakens, doesn't strengthen Israel's security,"" Mr Blinken said. It overturns a move made in 2019 by the Trump administration, which was welcomed by Israel, when then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that Washington no longer viewed settlements as breaching international law.",2024-02-23T20:01:32.000Z

Israel's Eurovision entry under scrutiny over alleged reference to HamasPublished23 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel says it will pull out of the Eurovision Song Contest if organisers try to censor its entry. It comes after the lyrics to Eden Golan's October Rain were leaked to the media earlier this week. According to the Israel Hayom newspaper, the song references the victims of the 7 October Hamas attacks, with lyrics including: ""They were all good children, each one of them."" Eurovision organiser The EBU said it was currently assessing the song. The contest's rules forbid political messages, in a gesture to neutrality. In previous years, the EBU has forced national representatives to change their lyrics. In 2009, Georgia withdrew from the contest after their proposed entry - We Don't Wanna Put In - was rejected for its obvious references to the Russian president. In a statement regarding Israel's 2024 entry, organisers said: ""The EBU is currently in the process of scrutinizing the lyrics, a process which is confidential between the EBU and the broadcaster until a final decision has been taken. ""If a song is deemed unacceptable for any reason, broadcasters are then given the opportunity to submit a new song or new lyrics."" However, Israel's public broadcaster, KAN, said it would reject any request to alter the lyrics. ""It should be noted that as far as the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation is concerned there is no intention to replace the song."" ""This means that if it is not approved by the European Broadcasting Union, Israel will not be able to participate in the competition, which will take place in Sweden next May."" KAN also confirmed that the leaked lyrics for October Rain were accurate, andpublished them in full on its website on Wednesday. Described as a ""moving and powerful ballad"" the song is based around the refrain ""I'm still wet from this October rain"". In the verse, Golan sings: ""Who told you boys don't cry/ Hours and hours/ And flowers/ Life is not a game for the cowards."" The reference to flowers is significant, according to Israel Hayom, as it is military slang for war fatalities. The song then ends in Hebrew: ""There's no air left to breathe/ There's no place/ No me, from day to day."" KAN said that Israel's culture minister Miki Zohar had contacted the President of the EBU to request that the panel approve the song. ""In his letter, the minister wrote that Israel is in one of its most complex periods, and that this fact cannot be ignored when choosing a song to represent it,"" the broadcaster reported. Writing on X, Mr Zohar said it would be ""scandalous"" to disqualify the song. ""The song of Israel, which will be performed by Eden Golan, is a moving song, which expresses the feelings of the people and the country these days, and is not political,"" he added. ""We all hope that Eurovision will remain a musical and cultural event and not a political arena - where the participating countries can bring their uniqueness and nationalism to the stage through music. ""I call on the European Broadcasting Union to continue to act professionally and neutrally, and not to let politics affect art."" Separately, musicians from other countries that participate in Eurovision have called for Israel to be suspended over the war in Gaza. In December, Iceland's Association of Composers and Lyricists published a statement saying Israel's military action made its participation incompatible with an event ""characterised by joy and optimism"". Similar protests have been raised in Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden, with several pointing out that Russia has been disqualified since its invasion of Ukraine two years ago. So far, Eurovision organisers have resisted calls for Israel's exclusion, saying the situations in Ukraine and Gaza are different. ""Comparisons between wars and conflicts are complex and difficult and, as a non-political media organization, not ours to make,"" Noel Curran, the director general of the European Broadcasting Union said in a statement. ""We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East,"" he said. However, he added, Eurovision was ""not a contest between governments"". ""The EBU is aligned with other international organizations, including sports unions and federations and other international bodies, that have similarly maintained their inclusive stance towards Israeli participants in major competitions at this time,"" the statement concluded.",2024-02-23T10:10:06.000Z

Gaza family takes legal action against Home Office over visasPublished23 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Palestinian refugee is taking legal action against the Home Office over what he says is in effect a refusal to grant visas to his family in Gaza. The Home Office rejected the man's request to allow his wife and four young children to apply for visas without giving fingerprints. Two of his children caughthepatitis A, which the World Health Organization saysis spreading in Gaza. The Home Office told BBC News it did not comment on individual cases. ""All applications are carefully considered on their individual merits and must meet the requirements of the immigration rules and published guidance,"" an official said. A court anonymity order means the man and his family cannot be identified, for their own protection. But in a witness statement to the court, he said he ""wanted to die"" when he had heard about the Home Office's decision. ""I am so afraid that my family will be killed, they will be killed while I am away from them, and I will blame myself for not being able to bring them here,"" the man said. People with refugee status can apply for family-reunion visas for their family members to join them in the UK without going through the asylum system themselves. Asylum Aid solicitor Anastasia Solopova, who is representing the family, told BBC News they had applied for these in December. In most circumstances, when someone applies for a long-term British visa outside of the UK, they need to give their biometrics - fingerprints and a photograph - at a visa-application centre (VAC), for security reasons. But because there are no working VACs in Gaza, the family had applied to either be exempt from having to give their fingerprints or be allowed to travel to Egypt to give them at a centre there. In a refusal letter seen by BBC News, the Home Office told the man the government was ""not able to assist with exit/entry requirements for a third country, where a person needs to travel to that country to... submit biometrics"". Guidance, it adds, ""makes it clear that people must only apply for entry clearance if they can travel to the UK"". There was now no way for the family to submit their biometrics, Ms Solopova said. And they had brought a judicial review, asking a judge to examine the Home Office's decision. ""We are challenging the decision in court - but the truth is that with every day of delay, our client's family's lives are put more in danger,"" Ms Solopova said. ""The Home Office should never have made this unlawful decision, which could mean that our client's wife and children could possibly die in Gaza without ever seeing our client again."" Even before the current conflict, it was not easy for Palestinians to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing into Egypt. They had to register with the local Palestinian authorities two to four weeks in advance and may then have been rejected by either the Palestinian or Egyptian authorities with little warning or explanation. And since the current war began, Egypt has said it is reluctant to allow an influx of refugees from Gaza. In November,the Home Office told BBC Newsit was working with the Foreign Office to help British people and their non-British family members evacuate Gaza through the crossing. And at the time, a team of Home Office staff was helping visa applicants in Egypt. Now, people able to leave Gaza through the crossing can receive medical, consular and administrative support from British embassy staff in Cairo.",2024-02-23T04:41:42.000Z

"Anti-Muslim cases surge in UK since Hamas attacks, charity findsPublished22 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Anti-Muslim hate in the UK has more than tripled in the four months since Hamas's attacks, a charity has found. Tell Mama has documented 2,010 Islamophobic incidents between 7 October and 7 February - a steep rise from the 600 it recorded for the same period the year previously. It is the largest number over four months since the charity began in 2011. Anti-Muslim and antisemitic attacks have surged in the UK following the Israel-Gaza conflict. Tell Mama, which describes itself as the leading agency on monitoring anti-Muslim hate crime, said slightly over half of the incidents in the past four months were cases of hate speech on social media. But the charity also recorded cases of physical assault, abusive behaviour, threats and acts of vandalism, with the largest proportion of incidents - 576 cases - taking place in London. Muslim women were targeted in two out of every three recorded incidents, the charity added. Incidents recorded by the organisation include: Tell Mama director Iman Atta told the BBC: ""Individuals walking down the streets are being targeted, harassed, households have been doodled with graffiti calling people 'killers', 'terrorists', 'Hamas sympathisers'. ""Anti-Muslim hatred and Islamophobia is gendered - it's misogyny as well as the visibility of that woman being either of an Asian background or wearing visible Muslim attires."" Reports of hate incidents in the UK have soared since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen infiltrated southern Israel killing about 1,200 people and taking 253 hostage. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 29,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Last week, the Community Security Trust (CST), which tracks antisemitic incidents across the UK, said4,103 attackswere recorded against members of the Jewish community in 2023. Two thirds of these occurred on or after October 7 - marking an almost six-fold increase in cases compared to the same period in 2022. ""The war unfortunately is impacting our communities here in the UK,"" Ms Atta said. ""Muslim communities, Jewish communities are picking up the brunt of the war. ""Emotions are running very high, but one thing both communities agree on is that we all need to be able to go around our day-to-day basis feeling safe, feeling that we're not going to be targeted for who we are. ""A Muslim woman should not have to take off her headscarf just because she doesn't want to be targeted, nor a Jewish person should have to hide their Star of David because they don't want to be targeted."" The government said it condemned the recent rise in reported anti-Muslim hatred and antisemitism, adding there was ""no place for hate in our society"". ""We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law,"" a spokesperson said, adding that further funding had been made available to communities to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.",2024-02-22T21:50:27.000Z

"UK-owned ship damaged in Houthi missile attack off Yemen, US saysPublished22 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","A Palau-flagged, British-owned cargo ship was damaged and a minor injury was reported in the Gulf of Aden after it was hit by two missiles launched by Yemen's Houthis, the US military says. The Islander is continuing its voyage following the attack south-east of the Yemeni port city of Aden. UK maritime authorities said the missiles caused a fire on board. A Houthi spokesman confirmed they had targeted the Islander and said they had also launched drones at a US warship. The Houthis, who are backed by Iran and control much of north-western Yemen, have been attacking merchant vessels in the region since November. They say their attacks are a show of support for the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK. US and British warships have been deployed as part of an international task force to protect freedom of navigation and commercial shipping in the critical waterway, which accounts for about 12% of global seaborne trade. US forces, occasionally backed by British warplanes, have also been striking Houthi military targets in Yemen in response to the attacks since mid-January, but so far the Houthis have not been deterred. The US military's Central Command said in a statement on Thursday that between 04:30 and 05:30 (01:30-02:30 GMT) US aircraft and a coalition warship shot down six Houthi one-way attack unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, in the Red Sea. Later, between 08:30 and 09:45, the Houthis fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles from southern Yemen into the Gulf of Aden, it added. ""The missiles impacted MV Islander a Palau-flagged, UK-owned, cargo carrier causing one minor injury and damage. The ship is continuing its voyage."" Earlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency reported that two missiles set ablaze a vessel - which it did not identify - about 70 nautical miles (130km) south-east of Aden. It said the vessel and crew were safe and proceeding to their next port of call. According to maritime security firm Ambrey the ship's AIS transponder gave its destination as ""Syrian crew on board"", but it appeared to be heading in the direction of the Red Sea from Thailand. The Israeli military meanwhile said its air defence system had successfully intercepted a ""launch which was identified in the area of the Red Sea and was en route to Israel"". The Houthi spokesman later confirmed they had launched missiles and drones at various targets in what it called the ""south of occupied Palestine"". In a televised speech on Thursday afternoon, the Houthis' leader said a total of 48 ships had now been targeted and that 13 operations had been carried out in the past week because the US and UK had ""failed"". ""Operations in the Red and Arabian Seas, Bab al-Mandab Strait, and the Gulf of Aden are continuing, escalating, and effective,"" Abdul Malik al-Houthi declared. He also announced that the Houthis had introduced ""submarine weapons"", which he described as ""worrying for the enemy"". On Monday, the crew of a Belize-flagged, British-registered cargo vessel Rubymar had to abandon ship in the Bab al-Mandab Strait - which connects the Gulf of Aden with the Red Sea - after it was hit by a Houthi missile and started letting in water. Images of the ship from Wednesday, which were obtained by the BBC, showed the ship was down by the stern but had not sunk, as the Houthis initially claimed. It is carrying 22 tonnes of a fertiliser classified as ""very dangerous"". The Houthis also said they had attacked two US-owned cargo ships in the Gulf of Aden on Monday. The US military confirmed that two missiles were fired at one of them, the Greek-flagged Sea Champion, which was able to continue its journey to Aden to deliver grain. The US state department condemned the attacks as ""reckless and indiscriminate"", warning that they had delayed deliveries of critical humanitarian aid to Yemen, Sudan and Ethiopia. It also said the US and its allies would continue to take ""appropriate action"".",2024-02-22T20:29:11.000Z

Walled site grows at Egypt border near GazaPublished22 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Egypt has built more than 3km of wall in the past week in addition to further clearance of a large area next to its border with Gaza, BBC Verify has found. It comes after Israel warned it is preparing for a ground offensive in Gaza's southern city of Rafah. The city has seen a huge increase in its population in recent months. Egyptian authorities say ""no provisions"" are being made for displaced Palestinians and the area is meant for a ""logistical hub"" for aid. But an aid worker for a UK charity, who is part of the humanitarian efforts in Gaza, told the BBC she had ""never seen large scale clearing of land"" for such a logistical hub and they were unaware of any such plan. More than 16 sq km (6 sq miles) have been cleared just over the border from Gaza, visible in the recent satellite images. The clearing of this area began at the start of February, but has expanded dramatically over the past week. Sections of wall around this area now appear to be under construction. On 14 February, about 0.8km (0.5 miles) of wall were visible in satellite imagery, but the most recent pictures indicate more that than 4km (2.5 miles) has now been erected. The wall appears to be being built simultaneously in three places - in this image you can see construction in the south-west corner of the cleared area. What appears to be a crane and other vehicles can be seen near construction materials. In the south-east corner, you can see a build up of trucks along the main road which leads from north Egypt into Gaza. Some of these trucks are parked off the main road and within the newly-cleared area. Followingreports the area was being made to house Palestinian refugees,Egypt publicly denied it was making any such preparations. Since the start of the Gaza war following Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October, Egypt has consistently said it would not open its border to refugees. It has taken that stance partly because it does not want to appear complicit in the large-scale displacement of Palestinians, but also out of economic and security concerns. And Israel has previously said that it has ""no intention of evacuating Palestinian civilians to Egypt"". The authorities in Egypt's North Sinai province released a statement saying ""the armed forces are setting up a logistical area to receive aid for Gaza"" to ease the congestion on the roads near the border. The local governor said the area was being prepared for ""truck waiting areas, secure warehouses, administrative offices, and driver accommodations"". However, the BBC has spoken to a humanitarian expert, who is part of a group which coordinates aid efforts into Gaza, and she says they haven't heard of any such plan. ""If there was a plan to suddenly increase the capacity by constructing a hub of sorts, I would suggest that this would have been shared [with aid agencies] by the Egyptian authorities,"" she said. The aid worker didn't want to be named, as it could complicate the relationship between the aid organisation she works for and the Egyptian authorities. ""The capacity for warehousing in Egypt is something that is discussed at almost every meeting. Given that this hasn't been shared, my assumption is that this is not what the plan is,"" she added. We showed the latest satellite images to several security experts to see what they thought its purpose could be. Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer in security studies at Kings College, London, said: ""You do not need to clear that much ground to stage waiting trucks. To me, it very much looks like Egypt making preparations for the worst-case scenario."" ""If you put this in perspective of how big this area this is, 16 km sq of trucks, that is thousands and thousands of trucks. There's never been a situation where you've had thousands of trucks waiting at the border."" Graphics by Filipa Silverio",2024-02-22T19:16:30.000Z

Israel-Gaza: On board the plane evacuating injured PalestiniansPublished22 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Two very different flights in 24 hours, each with the same aim: to alleviate Gaza's suffering. The first is the less perilous: an Etihad Airways passenger plane, flight EY750 from Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. The Boeing 777 has been converted into a virtual flying ambulance with seats in economy turned into hospital beds. Its mission, paid for by the government of the UAE, is to return civilians who had previously got out after being trapped in Rafah in southern Gaza, in some cases for months, and to evacuate wounded Palestinian children who had crossed from Gaza to al-Arish in Egypt's northern Sinai. After hours on the ground, the first evacuees start to make it on board. There is relief on their faces as they make it across the airfield to the plane, but uncertainty too. Many have left family members behind in Gaza. Among them is 58-year-old Hanaa Hasan Abu Namous. Her hand is badly injured. She says 25 members of her family were killed in an Israeli air strike on their home in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. ""During the war they were displaced,"" she tells me. ""Thirty or 50 of them would come to our house. We are civilians. We never have and never will fight."" She holds a picture on her phone of shroud-wrapped bodies. They had to be buried together, four or five to a coffin, she says. Sitting a few rows forward is 13-year-old Yazan Wajih Barhum, whose left foot has been partially amputated. He was at a neighbour's house in Rafah when an Israeli bomb hit, he says. His seven-year-old brother, Yamen, was hit with shrapnel in the eye and is already in Abu Dhabi. When I ask him when they last saw each other he answers, quick as a flash, ""58 days ago"". What are his hopes for the future, I ask. ""To be able to walk on my legs again, get back to how I was, play football with my friends, and for the war to end so I can go back to my country"", he says. The crew on board, regular airline staff, hand the 25 injured children backpacks with games and a SpongeBob blanket. The kids who are able sit watching cartoons on the entertainment system; some are on stretchers at the back of the plane. Kiran Sadasivan, the cabin manager, welcomes the children and their chaperones on board, taking pictures with their phones and distributing meals. ""This is my tenth mission flight,"" he tells me. ""And I'll be on the next one in a few days."" Also on board is Dr Maha Barakat, the UAE's assistant foreign affairs minister. A UK-trained doctor, she does not rest during the 20-hour evacuation mission, checking on the patients and medical team and liaising with the Egyptian authorities on the ground. ""The actual day today was clearly a more challenging day than usual,"" she says. ""There was a particular girl that we were trying to get through - she was in urgent medical need. And she wasn't able to make it to the border. However, we will have another plane coming in the next few days."" Not all the Palestinians on the plane are leaving Gaza. Sitting alone, wearing a dark red headscarf and with a small leather handbag at her side is mother-of-three Zahra Mohammed Al-Qeiq. She has leukaemia, and left Gaza a few months ago for treatment in Abu Dhabi. Now she is returning to Rafah. Isn't she scared, I ask her. ""The whole period I spent in the Emirates, my kids were crying on calls asking me to come back, saying 'come back; we will die in Gaza'. I had to stop my treatment and go back to my children,"" she says. Emirati doctors have given her six months of chemotherapy drugs. ""I cried every night I was away from home. I have to go back, they are my children,"" she says. Twenty-four hours later, a Royal Jordanian Airforce cargo plane - ""Guts Airline"" painted on its side - heads for Gaza at sunset. The aircrew on board have done this flight a dozen times. As they reach 17,000ft (5,200m), they put on oxygen masks and make final precise adjustments for the drop. For the first time, the cargo on board is British: four tonnes of supplies, including fuel, medical gear and food rations, to resupply the Jordanian-run field hospital in Gaza City. Until now Britain has only sent aid by land and sea, but northern Gaza has become almost entirely unreachable.The World Food Programme has suspended deliveriesthere because its convoys have endured ""complete chaos and violence"", it said. There is a heavy Israeli military presence on the ground. The Jordanian authorities will not disclose what co-ordination is made with Israel to allow the plane to fly overhead without incident. Israel maintains a tight grip on the aid going into Gaza. Britain and others have complained that only a fraction of the aid needed is making it into the strip. Everything is subject to stringent Israeli checks, to prevent supplies making it inside that would aid Hamas. Most of the people in this once densely packed part of Gaza have been driven out by Israeli forces, but some 300,000 remain, barely surviving in the most desperate of circumstances. The UN has been warning for months of the threat of famine in northern Gaza. I watch as the cargo doors opened and the first two pallets of supplies fly off into the black night. The plane banks sharply and turns, and the second two pallets are launched. The Jordanian crew give a thumbs-up and head for home. It is a small drop in the chasm of Gaza's need. But this aid sent into the night at least manages to get through; the crew confirms it has landed right on target.",2024-02-22T15:59:05.000Z

Palestinian gunmen kill Israeli man near West Bank settlementPublished22 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An Israeli man has been killed and 13 other people have been wounded in an attack by three Palestinian gunmen near an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, police and medics say. The attackers fired automatic weapons at vehicles waiting at a checkpoint on a highway outside Maale Adumim. Security forces and armed civilians killed two of the attackers while the third was detained, police said. Palestinian armed group Hamas praised the attack but did not claim it. There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's deadly attacks in Israel on 7 October. At least 394 Palestinians - members of armed groups, attackers and civilians - had been killed in conflict-related incidents in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, or in Israel as of Tuesday, according to the UN. During the same period, 12 Israelis, including four security forces personnel, had been killed. Israel's police force said Thursday's attack took place near the al-Zaim checkpoint on Highway 1, which connects Maale Adumim with Jerusalem. The three Palestinian gunmen arrived at the scene in two separate vehicles, armed with weapons including an M-16 rifle and a Carlo sub-machine gun. After getting out, they opened fire towards vehicles stuck in a traffic jam. Two of the attackers were shot dead by security forces and armed civilians at the scene. The third gunmen tried to escape but was ""neutralised"" and taken into custody. Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service said paramedics found casualties in five vehicles along a 500m-long (1,640ft) stretch of the highway. A man who was later identified as Matan Elmaliach, a 26-year-old man from Maale Adumim, died of his wounds at the scene, it said. Thirteen other people were wounded, including a 23-year-old pregnant woman who was shot in the upper body and is in a serious condition. Eight people were taken to Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, and five to Shaare Zedek Hospital. The attackers were identified as three Palestinian men, including two brothers, from the West Bank city of Bethlehem, 10km (6 miles) to the south-west. Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, told journalists at the scene: ""The enemies... want to hurt us. They hate us."" He said authorities needed to ""distribute more weapons"" to Israeli civilians for protection and install more roadblocks around Palestinian communities in the West Bank, arguing that ""our right to life is superior to the freedom of movement"" of Palestinians. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, another far-right politician, meanwhile called for the immediate approval of plans for thousands more homes in settlements like Maale Adumim. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel and the US dispute this. Hamas called Thursday's attack a ""natural response"" to Israeli ""massacres and crimes"" in Gaza and the West Bank, and called on Palestinians to take up arms. The shooting comes six days after a Palestinian man shot and killed two people at a bus stop near the southern Israeli town of Kiryat Malakhi.",2024-02-22T14:45:35.000Z

How the row over Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle unfoldedPublished22 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle should not continue in his role, the SNP has said. The party's Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, was speaking in the Commons after an evening of chaos in the chamber, following an impassioned debate on the Israel-Gaza war. Sir Lindsay had decided to allow a vote on a Labour amendment to an SNP motion, calling for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict, sparking fury among SNP and Conservative MPs who accused him of breaking with parliamentary convention. On Thursday, Mr Flynn said proceedings had ""descended into farce"". Sir Lindsay responded by offering the SNP an emergency debate on the conflict in Gaza and apologised for a second time, saying ""I made a mistake"". He said his priority was MPs' safety, adding: ""I have a duty of care and if my mistake is looking after members, I am guilty."" We look back at how the row unfolded.",2024-02-22T14:35:29.000Z

Sir Lindsay Hoyle's Chorley constituents react to Gaza vote rowPublished22 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"People living in House of Commons Speaker Lyndsay Hoyle's constituency have rallied round him in the face of criticism over his handling of Gaza ceasefire debate. Sir Lindsay Hoyle sparked fury from SNP and Conservative MPs when he broke with convention to allow a vote on a Labour motion for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"". One constituent in Chorley, Lancashire - which he has represented for over 30 years - said ""everyone makes mistakes"". And another said they believed he ""tried to do things in a fair way"". Sir Lindsay's decision to allow the vote on the Labour amendment meant MPs could call for a ceasefire without backing a differently-worded SNP motion, limiting a potential Labour rebellion. He has said he allowed the vote to protect MPs' safety, but the decision saw the Commons descend into acrimony. Sir Lindsay later apologised, but has still faced calls to resign. BBC News spoke to people in Chorley to gauge their reaction to the row engulfing their MP. Market trader John Tyrer said: ""I've never heard one bad word said about Lindsay from any Chorley people,"" he said. ""He comes here, he's just one of the lads, and I think he's been first class for Chorley. ""He can't resign, if it is a mistake, so what? Everybody makes mistakes. ""Just because he's the Speaker, he's not infallible, is he?"" Marie, who runs a sandwich shop on Chorley market, said she was ""gutted"" when she heard what had happened in the Commons. ""I swear Lindsay Hoyle's one of the best people you'll ever meet. ""He is for the people, he doesn't forget where he's come from. He speaks to everyone on the market. ""He's put Chorley on the map. ""It would be sad if he went."" Jan, who has been a Chorley resident for over 30 years, said Sir Lindsay ""genuinely does love his local town and he spends a lot of time here"". ""I think he is quite a genuine person. ""My only concern is because he's been the Speaker for so long, we've not really had full representation like we would if he wasn't doing that."" She said she believed it must be hard for Sir Lindsay to put his previous political career with Labour to one side while working as Speaker. ""He does try to do things in a fair way. ""If you say something that offends people, or upsets people then you apologise, and then let's move on. ""I think it would be a shame if he went under a bit of a cloud, because he's done a really good job."" Why not follow BBC Lancashire onFacebook,XandInstagram?

Speaker Lindsay Hoyle feared for MPs' safety before Gaza votePublished22 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"In his statement on Wednesday evening, the Commons Speaker spoke of his deep concern about the security of MPs. Sir Lindsay Hoyle said that those concerns had played a part in his decision to break with precedent and to allow Labour to table a vote during an SNP debate. The speaker had heard from numerous Labour MPs who have faced criticism after they voted for their party's Gaza amendment in November, which stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. Sir Lindsay wanted to give Labour MPs a chance on Wednesday to vote for their party's new amendment which called for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"". Many Labour MPs wanted the chance to vote for that because they believed the SNP motion, which called for an immediate ceasefire, then went too far by accusing Israel of the collective punishment of people in Gaza. And they felt the government amendment, which called for humanitarian pauses, did not go far enough. BBC Newsnight has heard from Labour MPs who are worried about their security. Some have required police protection after they voted for the Labour amendment in November. Labour MPs have raised their concerns with the speaker and the police. Many believe the dangers they face are far graver than people realise.",2024-02-22T12:31:37.000Z

Who is the Speaker of the House of Commons and what do they do?Published22 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The future of the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is under threat, after a Gaza-ceasefire debate descended into chaos. Dozens of MPs have called for his resignation. Sir Lindsay Hoyle was elected as Speaker on 4 November 2019, following the resignation of the previous Speaker, John Bercow. Sir Lindsay was originally elected to Parliament as Labour MP for Chorley, Lancs, but the role of the Speaker is politically impartial. Incoming Speakers resign from their party when appointed and typically stand unopposed in general elections held during their term in office. They can still undertake work on behalf of their constituents. Therole of the Speaker dates back several centuries, and is almost as old as Parliament itself, but has evolved significantly over time. The modern Speaker has a number of important duties: The Speaker works closely withthe Clerk of the House of Commons, currently Tom Goldsmith,who advises on parliamentary procedure and constitutional matters. The Clerk is not an MP or a civil servant, and is also politically neutral. Former Conservative MP Eleanor Laingis the main deputy Speaker, and can perform all of the Speaker's duties in his absence. The House of Lords has its own Speaker,currently Lord McFall of Alcluith. Sir Lindsaywas accused of ""playing party politics""by going against the usual parliamentary convention, to allow a vote on a Labour motion for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"" in Gaza. Wednesday had been designated an SNP opposition day in the Commons. Normally, the nominated opposition party - in this case the Scottish National Party - proposes a motion for debate. And typically only the government is allowed to suggest amendments to an opposition motion. But Sir Lindsay decided to let MPs vote on a Labour amendment. He said this was so MPs could express their view on ""the widest range of propositions"" - but critics say he let Labour hijack the Gaza debate. The move meant Labour MPs could call for a ceasefire, without backing the differently worded SNP motion, which could have split the party. A number of SNP and Conservative MPs walked out of the Commons chamber in protest. Sir Lindsay has since apologised twice for ""making the wrong decision"", but more than 60 MPs have called for his resignation. The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn told Sir Lindsay that his party no longer had confidence in him as Speaker. The Speaker is elected by a secret ballot of MPs at the beginning of a new Parliament after a general election - or following the death or retirement of their predecessor. If the Speaker wishes to continue in their post after a general election, they do not need to be re-elected by secret ballot and can instead be reappointed if a majority of MPs vote in their favour. There is no formal mechanism for MPs to oust the Speaker from their role. Erskine May, the ""bible"" of parliamentary procedure, explains that once elected, the Speaker ""continues in that office during the whole Parliament, unless in the meantime they resign or are removed by death"". MPs can criticise the Speaker by putting down a motion against them. The government of the day can then provide time for it to be debated on the floor of the House. Only three such motions have been debated since World War Two, according to the Institute for Government. But there is a precedent for a Speaker being pressurised to resign. Michael Martin, who served in the role from 2000 to 2009, stepped down after criticism of his handling of the MPs' expenses scandal. He said he wanted to maintain the unity of the House of Commons. Former Speakers are traditionally offereda life peerage in the House of Lords. The first female Speaker, Betty Boothroyd, spent more than 20 years in the Lords,until her death in 2023. Elected as the Labour MP for West Bromwich West in 1973, Baroness Boothroyd served as Speaker between 1992 and 2000. However, when he stepped down in 2019,John Bercow became the first Speaker for 230 years not to be nominated for the Lords. Mr Bercow had been accused of bullying by his former colleagues. He told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions that he had ""made a lot of enemies"" during his 10-year stint in the Commons, but denied he had bullied anyone.",2024-02-22T11:43:35.000Z

Sir Lindsay Hoyle: Speaker accused of 'party politics' over Gaza votePublished22 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Commons Speaker is facing accusations he played ""party politics"" by granting a vote on Labour's Gaza ceasefire motion. Sir Lindsay Hoyle broke with convention to allow the vote during a debate, sparking fury from SNP and Conservative MPs. He said he allowed the vote on to protect MPs' safety, but it saw the Commons descend into acrimony. Sir Lindsay later apologised, but still faces calls to resign. The move meant Labour MPs could call for a ceasefire without backing a differently-worded SNP motion, limiting a potential Labour rebellion. Health Minister Maria Caulfield claimed the decision was made ""under undue pressure"" from Labour, and accused Sir Lindsay of ""putting party politics"" above his obligation as Speaker to be impartial. This has been denied by both Labour and a source close to the Speaker. Some 56 Tory and SNP MPs have signed a motion declaring they have no confidence in Sir Lindsay, who is due to meet parties for clear-the-air talks. The row erupted during a debate allocated to the Scottish National Party, during which they are allowed to put forward motions for debate and vote. The SNP tabled a motion calling for an ""immediate ceasefire"" in Gaza and calling for an end to the ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"". Labour, which has shifted its stance on the conflict on recent days, tabled an amendment that also backed an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, but also noted that Israel ""cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence"". Sir Lindsay broke with tradition on such Commons debates by allowing a vote on Labour's amendment to the SNP's motion. After the Conservatives then said they wouldn't take part, Labour's motion was passed, meaning a standalone vote on the SNP wording couldn't take place. Explaining his decision, Sir Lindsay said he wanted to give MPs the chance to vote on ""the widest range of propositions,"" and was also concerned about threats to MPs' security over the issue. But he was accused of allowing the vote to be ""hijacked"" by Labour, with some SNP and Tory MPs walking out in protest. Sir Keir suffered a major revolt over Gaza in November when 56 of his MPs, including 10 frontbenchers,defied him to back an SNP motion urging an immediate ceasefire. In a statement after the debate, SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said Sir Lindsay had ""colluded"" with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to ""block Parliament voting on the SNP motion"". Speaking on Thursday, Labour campaign co-ordinator Pat McFadden acknowledged that party leader Sir Keir had lobbied Sir Lindsay before the debate to allow a vote on Labour's motion. But he denied reports Labour had threatened to withdraw support from the Speaker after the election unless he allowed the vote, adding that Sir Lindsay had acted in ""good faith"". He blamed the Conservatives' decision not to take part in the debate for a vote on the SNP's wording not taking place, accusing them of trying to avoid a rebellion from their own MPs. This was denied by Health Minister Maria Caulfield, who added that Sir Lindsay's decision meant MPs from her party could face criticism for not backing the SNP motion. ""He took the threats to Labour MPs seriously, but took no consideration of what would happen to Conservative MPs,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. There is no formal mechanism allowing MPs to oust the Speaker, but it is a convention they should have the confidence of the main parties in the Commons. On Thursday more MPs signed an early day motion signed by Tory and SNP MPs expressing no confidence in him. SNP MP Pete Wishart was one of the MPs to put their names to the motion, and said he had done so because the ""position of the Speaker is pretty much untenable"". However, many other MPs said they would not be taking this step. Former Conservative minister Robert Buckland said he accepted the Speaker's apology and would not be asking for a vote of confidence. Sir Lindsay was first elected as a Labour MP but after becoming Speaker he relinquished his party affiliation, as is the convention. Israel launched its operations in Gaza following an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. Since then, Israel's military campaign has killed more than 29,000 people in Gaza, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are accepted by the United Nations.",2024-02-22T09:57:47.000Z

Gaza ceasefire vote: Commons debate descends into chaosPublished21 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Commons debate on calls for a ceasefire in Gaza descended into chaos, after the Speaker was accused of allowing it to be ""hijacked"" by Labour. Sir Lindsay Hoyle sparked fury from the SNP and Conservatives when he broke with convention to allow a vote on a Labour motion for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"". The Speaker later apologised, saying he had acted ""with the right intentions"". But the SNP said they had been ""treated with complete and utter contempt"". Labour's amendment went through to loud shouts of ""aye"" without a formal vote, after the government said it would not take part in protest. This meant there was no vote on the SNP's motion, which called for an ""immediate ceasefire"", and was originally meant to be the focus of the debate. The government does not have to adopt Labour's position as the vote is not binding. In extraordinary scenes, SNP MPs and some Tories walked out of the chamber over the Speaker's handling of the vote. Following calls for him to return to explain his decision, Sir Lindsay told the Commons he chose to allow a vote on the Labour motion so MPs could express their view on ""the widest range of propositions"". Amid shouts of resign, he said: ""I thought I was doing the right thing and the best thing, and I regret it, and I apologise for how it's ended up. ""I do take responsibility for my actions, and that's why I want to meet with the key players who have been involved."" SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said whilst he acknowledged the Speaker's apology, Commons officials had warned the decision could lead to his party not having a vote, on a day which had been designated an SNP opposition day. Visibly furious, he said his party had been treated ""with complete and utter contempt"". ""I will take significant convincing that your position is not now intolerable,"" he added. In a statement after the debate, Mr Flynn said it was ""a disgrace that Sir Keir Starmer and the Speaker colluded to block Parliament voting on the SNP motion"". ""This should have been the chance for the UK Parliament to do the right thing and vote for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel - instead it turned into a Westminster circus,"" he added. It came after Commons leader Penny Mordaunt said Sir Lindsay had ""undermined the confidence"" of the House and suggested his decision had allowed the debate to be ""hijacked"" by Labour. She said this had ""has raised temperatures in this House on an issue where feelings are already running high"". Earlier, a source close to the Speaker said the suggestion he was pressurised was ""absolutely untrue"". Sir Keir accused the Conservatives and SNP of ""choosing political games over serious solutions"". ""Today was a chance for Parliament to unite and speak with one voice on the horrendous situation in Gaza and Israel,"" he said in a statement following the debate. Sir Lindsay was first elected as a Labour MP but after becoming Speaker he relinquished his party affiliation, as is the convention. While he said he would meet key MPs from the main parties to discuss what happened, intense pressure remains on the Speaker. More than 30 Tory and SNP MPs have declared they have no confidence in himby signing an early day motion. Very few early day motions are debated but they allow MPs to show their support for an issue. The debate took place as thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered in Parliament Square. Throughout the day, a long queue had formed outside the Commons, with protesters hoping to lobby MPs in person to support a ceasefire. Sir Lindsay's decision meant Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer avoided another potential rebellion over the party's position on Gaza as Labour MPs were able to show their support for a ceasefire without voting for an SNP motion. The motion went further than Labour's by calling for an end to the ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"". Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy also argued it did not ""lay out a path to a sustainable peace"" and ""appears to be one-sided"". ""For any ceasefire to work it must by necessity be observed by all sides,"" he added. Labour's own amendment noted that Israel ""cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence"" and called for a diplomatic process to deliver ""a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state"". Last November Sir Keir suffered a major revolt when 56 of his MPs, including 10 frontbenchers,defied him to back an SNP motion urging an immediate ceasefire. Earlier this week, Labour shifted its position to call for ""an immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", following months of pressure from backbenchers and activists. The government is calling for ""an immediate humanitarian pause"", as well as supporting moves towards a ""permanent sustainable ceasefire"". Israel launched its operations in Gaza following an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. Since then, Israel's military campaign has killed more than 29,000 people in Gaza, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-02-21T22:46:58.000Z

Israel-Gaza: UK aid supplies air-dropped into Gaza for first timePublished21 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The UK has air-dropped aid into Gaza for the first time since war broke out after striking a deal with Jordan. Four tonnes of supplies including medicines, food and fuel were delivered into the strip on a Jordanian Air Force plane on Wednesday. Packages fitted with parachutes floated down to the Tal Al-Hawa Hospital in northern Gaza. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the aid would save lives and keep the hospital running. The UK has until now only sent aid to Gaza by land and sea, but northern Gaza - a wasteland after nearly five months of war - is impossible to reach. The World Food Programme has suspended deliveries there because its convoys had endured ""complete chaos and violence"", the organisation said. There is a heavy Israeli military presence in the area and much of the population were forced south. However, an estimated 300,000 Palestinians remain in northern Gaza with little food or water and the UN has warned for months of a looming famine there. The British Jordanian delivery contained diesel, critical medical equipment and ration packs for patients and medical staff. As the last pallet sailed into the night sky, the Jordanian air crew saluted. It landed right on target, they said. Banking sharply over the Mediterranean sea in two passes, the Royal Jordanian Air Force Hercules aircraft dropped the four tonnes of British aid directly into northern Gaza, just after sunset. The pallets - fitted with parachutes and GPS trackers to ensure they reached the hospital - were bound for an area just to the north of a Jordanian army field hospital in Gaza City. The UK Foreign Office said it signed an agreement with Jordan earlier this week which will see £1m ($1.2m) worth of UK aid sent to Gaza. Commenting on the deal, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said:  ""Thousands of patients will benefit and the fuel will enable this vital hospital to continue its life saving work. ""However, the situation in Gaza is desperate and significantly more aid is needed - and fast. We are calling for an immediate humanitarian pause to allow additional aid into Gaza as quickly as possible and bring hostages home.""",2024-02-21T22:37:58.000Z

Israeli report says Hamas sexual violence 'systematic and intentional'Published21 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel says it has gathered evidence Hamas gunmen ""systematically and intentionally"" committed sexual crimes during the 7 October attacks. A report by the umbrella organisationdescribes ""identical patterns"" of sexual violence at multiple locations. These allegedly included violent rapes of women conducted ""collectively"" or ""in front of an audience"". Hamas has denied its gunmen sexually assaulted women during the attacks. On 7 October, hundreds from the Palestinian armed group infiltrated southern Israel, where they killed about 1,200 people and took 253 others hostage. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which 29,300 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Warning: Contains graphic descriptions of rape and sexual violence Reports of sexual violence carried out by Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and others - began to emerge soon after 7 October and have accumulated steadily ever since. A senior Israeli police officer told British MPs last month there was ""clear evidence"" - collected from forensic investigations as well as from hundreds of statements by witnesses and first responders - that sexual crimes had been committed on a scale large enough to define it as a crime against humanity. The BBC has also seen and heard evidenceof rape, sexual violence and mutilation of women. The report by the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel (ACCRI) brings together much of what has been reported, as well as other information that it says it has received directly from professionals and confidential calls. It found that the 7 October attacks included ""brutal acts of violent rape, often involving threats with weapons, specifically directed towards injured women"". ""Many rape incidents occurred collectively, with collaboration among the perpetrating terrorists,"" the report says. ""In some cases, rape was conducted in front of an audience, such as partners, family, or friends, to increase the pain and humiliation for all present."" ""Some Hamas members pursued victims who escaped the massacre, dragging them by their hair with screams. The majority of victims were subsequently killed during or after the sexual assault."" It also cites various sources as indicating that many victims' bodies were ""found mutilated and bound, with sexual organs brutally attacked, and in some cases, weapons were inserted into them"". The report concludes that there is ""a clear picture of identical patterns of action repeated in each of the attack zones"" - the Nova festival, homes in kibbutzim and villages near the Gaza border, and Israeli military bases. Several Nova festival survivors reported cases of gang rapes, ""where women were abused and handled between multiple terrorists who beat, injured, and ultimately killed them"", it says. First responders and volunteer body collectors who went to border communities witnessed signs of sexual violence on women and girls, as did those who identified the bodies of female soldiers killed at bases. The report also warns that information from released hostages suggests abuse has continued in captivity - an allegation that Hamas has denied. The BBC's Paul Adams in Jerusalem says this is something Israeli officials are extremely reluctant to talk about openly, out of respect for anxious family members. But they do say that one reason Hamas is still holding female hostages is that it does not want their stories to be told. Asked about these reports at a recent briefing, a senior Israeli official declined to give details, saying simply: ""Believe me. We know."" The ACCRI says it has submitted its findings to the UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, who is carrying out a similar investigation and visited Israel last month. Israel has complained that the UN and other international organisations have been slow to respond to the allegations, and the ACCRI's executive director said its report now left them ""no room for denial or disregard"". On Monday, several independent UN experts put out a statement expressing concern about reports of violence by Israeli forces against Palestinian women and girls in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. They said the ""credible allegations"" included that women and girls had been killed extrajudicially in Gaza, and that others detained in Gaza and the West Bank had been subjected to multiple forms of sexual assault. Israel rejected the allegations as ""despicable and unfounded"".",2024-02-21T20:04:04.000Z

Row after Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle picks Labour Gaza motionPublished21 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A row has erupted after the Commons Speaker allowed MPs to vote on a Labour motion on the Israel-Hamas conflict. The amendment from Sir Keir Starmer would allow Labour MPs to back the party's motion calling for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", defusing a potential rebellion. It means they can call for a ceasefire without backing a differently-worded SNP motion. Sir Lindsay Hoyle's decision prompted anger from SNP and Conservative MPs. They accused him of breaking with precedent for allowing the votes. Senior Labour figures told BBC Newsnight Sir Lindsay was left in no doubt Labour was prepared to see him replaced as Speaker after the next general election unless he selected the party's ceasefire amendment for a vote. They said it was made clear to the Speaker he would need Labour votes to be re-elected and this might not be forthcoming. However, a source close to the Speaker said the suggestion he was pressurised was ""absolutely untrue"". The source said he did not make the decision lightly and was mindful of the safety of MPs and the pressure they were under over the issue. He wanted to make sure as many MPs as possible could have their voices heard, rather than them ""going back to their constituencies without having been able to express themselves"", the source added. The Labour leader suffered a major revolt over the issue in November, when 56 of his MPs, including 10 frontbenchers, defied him to back an SNP motion urging an immediate ceasefire. Earlier this week, Labour shifted its position to call for ""an immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", following months of pressure from backbenchers and activists. The party says this mirrors the language of the UK's allies and reflects the circumstances in Gaza have changed, with growing concern about the humanitarian situation and the plight of remaining hostages. Wednesday's debate had been scheduled for the SNP to put forward its motion. It had been suggested Commons rules for this type of debate - known as an opposition day - would mean Labour's own ceasefire motion would not be picked for a vote. But in a Commons statement, Sir Lindsay said picking the Labour amendment would allow MPs the ""widest possible range of options"" on the ""highly sensitive subject"". It means Labour MPs will be able to formally endorse their own party's new stance at the vote, rather than being left solely with the choice of whether to back or reject the SNP's ceasefire call. The decision led to jeers from SNP MPs, with Brendan O'Hara, saying such a move appeared to be unprecedented. Another SNP MP, Pete Wishart, called the decision ""absolutely ridiculous"" adding: ""He [the Speaker] has totally lost it and this will come back to haunt him."" In a letter to Sir Lindsay, Clerk of the House of Commons Tom Goldsmith, who advises on parliamentary procedure, warned his decision meant ""long-established conventions are not being followed"". As well as calling for a ceasefire, the SNP motion urges an end to the ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"" and for Hamas to release Israeli hostages. But Labour argues its wording does not make it clear enough that a ceasefire must be observed by both Israel and Hamas. Its own amendment notes that Israel ""cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence"". Speaking during the debate, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said that while the SNP motion ""expresses our common desire for the fighting and suffering to stop"", it did not ""lay out a path to a sustainable peace"". He said it also ""appears to be one-sided"", adding: ""For any ceasefire to work it must by necessity be observed by all sides."" SNP foreign affairs spokesperson Mr O'Hara said his party wanted an immediate ceasefire ""from all combatants"". ""Voting for an immediate ceasefire today won't by itself bring about the end of the slaughter, but the impact and the optics of this Parliament, hitherto one of Israel's staunchest allies, saying enough is enough... would be enormous,"" he told the Commons. The SNP said while Labour's amendment was ""deficient"" the party would vote for it ""to maximise the chance of the UK parliament supporting an immediate ceasefire"". The government has tabled its own amendment, which Sir Lindsay also picked for a vote, supporting Israel's ""right to self-defence"" and urging negotiations ""to agree an immediate humanitarian pause"" in the fighting. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Rishi Sunak said this approach would ""create the conditions for a genuinely sustainable ceasefire"". ""Just calling for an immediate ceasefire now, which collapses into fighting in days or weeks, is in no one's interest,"" he added. Mr Lammy said there were ""elements"" of the government amendment Labour agreed with but there was ""a serious omission"" in the failure to call for an ""immediate"" ceasefire. Israel launched its operations in Gaza following an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign has left more than 29,000 people dead in Gaza, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-02-21T17:09:02.000Z

"'Dad, please don't go out': The Gazans killed as Israel freed hostagesPublished21 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","When Israeli special forces rescued two of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas, there was relief for their families and a boost for national morale. But the rescue on 12 February has left angry feelings in Gaza, where more than 70 people were reported killed on the night. Warning: Readers may find some of the details below distressing. Nawara al-Najjar was asleep in the tent that had been her family's home in Rafah for the last five weeks, just a few hundred metres away from the site of the rescue raid. Lying on the ground were Nawara, who is six months pregnant, her six children - ranging in age from 13 to four - and her husband Abed-Alrahman. They had fled from their home in Khan Younis, about 9km (6 miles) north, following the instructions of the Israel Defense Forces who said Rafah was a safe area. Before falling asleep, the couple discussed what to do about two of their children who had been injured. Their son had been burned by scalding food, and their daughter was recovering from facial paralysis caused by trauma in the early stages of the war. Before they became refugees, Abed-Alrahman did whatever work he could find to support his family, often as a labourer on farms. They were a strong couple who always tried to solve problems together. ""My husband was anxious, thinking about how he would find a way to treat them and where to take them,"" Nawara says. ""Our neighbours said they wanted to take my daughter to a doctor for treatment… So, we decided that he would be in charge of our son, and I would be in charge of my daughter."" Then something unusual happened. Nawara usually slept surrounded by the children. But that night, Abed-Alrahman asked to change the arrangement. ""Before he went to sleep, he asked me to come and sleep next to him. It was the first time he said, 'Come sleep with me'."" They fell into the exhausted sleep of refugee life. Then shortly before 02:00 (00:00 GMT), Nawara woke to the sound of shooting. Abed-Alrahman said he would go out and see what was happening. Nawara says: ""Our oldest son was telling him, 'Dad, please don't go out'. [Abed-Alrahman] was trying to reassure him that nothing would happen; my son was telling him not to go out, that he would die."" Then she felt a searing pain in her head. Shrapnel from an explosion had ripped into the tent. Nawara started screaming. At first she could not see anything. After some minutes her vision returned in time to see Abed-Alrahman in his death throes. She remembers the ""rattle"" of his final breaths. ""When my children first saw him, they were screaming, 'Oh, father, oh father, don't leave us, don't leave us'. I told them, 'Stay away from your father. Just pray for him'."" Daughter Malak, aged 13, was hit in the eye by a splinter of shrapnel. Four other children sustained minor wounds. They also endured the trauma of what they heard and saw - the explosions and their father being carried away to hospital. Later that night, in a hospital filled with other victims, it was confirmed to Nawara that Abed-Alrahman was dead. Weeping, she asks: ""What was his sin? What was his children's sin? What's my sin? I became a widow at 27. Malak says she was taken to three different hospitals to try and get treatment, but she lost her eye. ""I was not treated immediately. Only after three days was my surgery performed. I was injured in the eye and I was also shot in my waist. I'm in pain, pain, pain."" Then Malak became distraught, and cried out: ""I lost my dad. Enough!"" According to the health ministry, run under the direction of the Hamas government in Gaza, at least 74 people were killed during the raid in the early hours of 12 February. It is not possible to say precisely how many of the dead were civilians and how many were fighters. But witnesses and medical sources suggest a high proportion of the dead were non-combatants. The independent Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, based in Gaza, using details obtained from hospital lists, says 27 children and 22 women were among those killed. Mohammed al-Zaarab, 45, a father-of-10 from Khan Younis, also fled to Rafah believing it would be safe. He remembers being woken in his tent by the intensity of the assault. ""They were shelling with helicopters, with F-16 jets …My son was shot in his hand. Our neighbour was shot in the head."" The following day, Mohammed's elderly father felt unwell. He took him to the doctor, but soon after the old man died of a heart attack. ""I buried him. Today is the third day in his grave. Why is this happening to us?"" he asks. The International Medical Corps - which provides emergency aid in crisis zones around the world - runs a field hospital near the scene. Dr Javed Ali, a surgeon from Pakistan, was jolted awake by the first strikes and went to shelter in a safe room in the staff quarters near the hospital. ""Aside from the air strikes, we were hearing tanks in the background, there was active exchange of fire from small firearms, as well as a helicopter gunship that was going over the hospital fighting and firing in all directions. So, it was very, very scary. We thought that this was it."" Hearing the sound of ambulances, the medics decided to leave the safe room and help. Along with the wounded came women and children seeking shelter. ""The hospital itself is a tent structure. So there were a lot of concerns. Obviously, if there is any strike towards the hospital it will be devastating, but we had to make a decision to save as many patients as possible."" Many of the dead were thought to be still lying under the rubble of destroyed houses. Another doctor - from the international agency Médecins Sans Frontières - sent a series of anguished voice messages to colleagues in London after sunrise on 12 February. She described lying across her children's bodies to protect them as shrapnel flew through the windows of the room where they were sheltering. The doctor has given the BBC permission to quote the messages but wants to remain anonymous. Her account of what she found after the raid is harrowing. ""At our home when we were checking, I found pieces of human flesh. We found a whole lower limb belonging to a human that we don't know who he is. When I saw the pieces of flesh on the floor, I cried."" Since the beginning of the IDF incursion into Gaza, the military has accused Hamas of using the civilian population as human shields, and using medical facilities to conceal military operations and hide hostages. The rescue of two hostages - Fernando Simon Marman, 60, and Louis Har, 70 - in Rafah this month was a rare success for the Israeli teams searching for more than 130 people, including two children, still believed to be held captive. In a statement to the BBC about the events of 12 February, an IDF spokesman said it was ""committed to mitigating civilian harm"" during military operations. Military lawyers advised commanders so that strikes complied with international legal obligations. The statement says: ""This process is designed to ensure that senior commanders have all reasonably available information and professional advice that will ensure compliance with the Law of Armed Conflict, including by providing 'Target Cards' which facilitate an analysis that is conducted on a strike-by-strike basis, and takes into account the expected military advantage and the likely collateral civilian harm, amongst other matters. ""Even where circumstances do not allow for a targeting process involving this level of deliberate pre-planning and pre-approval, IDF regulations emphasise that commanders and soldiers must still comply with the Law of Armed Conflict."" Human rights organisations have previously accused Israel of using disproportionate force. In a statement on 8 February - four days before the hostage raid - Human Rights Watch warned that Israel ""might be carrying out unlawfully indiscriminate attacks. When it comes to the question of whether Israel is violating the law in Gaza, there is enough smoke to suspect a fire"". In December US President Joe Biden warned Israel against ""indiscriminate bombing"" in Gaza. Any legal deliberation on whether the raid constituted a disproportionate use of force, and therefore a war crime, must await an independent investigation. With no end to the war in sight, that process may take a long time. The anonymous MSF doctor who found body parts in her home is deeply pessimistic. ""To be honest, the one who died is the one who is lucky… the one who is left has been cursed and abandoned by all people around the world. It's not fair… I don't know how anybody can sleep knowing that our kids are suffering for nothing. We are only civilians."" Her message comes from inside the frightened, claustrophobic confines of Rafah, where 1.5 million people - six times its normal population - have sought shelter. Israel is threatening an invasion of Rafah in the next few weeks, necessary, it says, to destroy Hamas. The fear for the refugees is that the horror of 12 February will soon be overtaken by new miseries, and forgotten by the international community. ""I know that this message means nothing to a lot of people,"" the MSF doctor says, ""and will change nothing"".

"Israeli missile strike on Damascus flat kills two, Syria saysPublished21 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","At least two people have been killed in an Israeli missile strike in Syria's capital, Damascus, Syrian state media and activists say. The Syrian military said two civilians died when several missiles hit a block of flats in the Kafr Sousa district. A monitoring group said two foreigners and a Syrian civilian were killed, and that the area was frequented by senior figures from Iran's Revolutionary Guards and Lebanese group Hezbollah. The Israeli military has not commented. However, it has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes on targets in Syria that it says are linked to Iran and allied armed groups. It has reportedly stepped up such strikes since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip in October, in response to cross-border attacks on Israel by Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups in Lebanon and Syria, who say they are acting in support of the allied Palestinian group Hamas. Last month, a strike in Damascus that was blamed on Israel killed five senior Revolutionary Guards and several Syrian security personnel. Iran has built a wide network of allied armed groups and proxies operating in countries across the Middle East. They are all opposed to Israel and the US and sometimes refer to themselves as the ""Axis of Resistance"". A number of the armed groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah, are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US, UK and other countries. Syria's official Sana news agency cited a military source as saying a number of missiles were launched towards Damascus from the direction of the Israel-occupied Golan Heights shortly before 09:40 (07:40 GMT) on Wednesday. The missiles struck a residential building in Kafr Sousa, in the west of the city, killing two civilians and wounding another, the source added. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - which monitors the war in Syria via a network of sources - said the missiles killed two non-Syrian nationals who had been inside the block of flats. A Syrian civilian who had been on the street below was killed by falling shrapnel, it added. Video and photos posted online showed the aftermath of what appeared to be a precision strike on the fourth floor of the building, with extensive damage to the exterior and interior of one flat clearly visible. Several vehicles parked on the street below were also damaged, including an empty bus reportedly belonging to the adjacent Al-Bawader private school. In February 2023, a rocket attack blamed on Israel killed at least five people in Kafr Sousa, which is situated near a large complex used by security agencies. One report said the target was an installation where Iranian and Syrian military experts had been meetingto advance programmes to develop drone or missile capabilities of Iran-backed groups. Later on Wednesday, explosions were heard in Damascus after what the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported was ""a new Israeli attack on positions of Iranian-backed militias"" in the south-west of the capital. In a separate development, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that a woman had been killed and her child critically injured in an Israeli strike in the southern Lebanese village of Majdal Zoun. The Israeli military said its warplanes had struck three Hezbollah operational command centres in southern Lebanon, and that artillery had shelled the Alma al-Shaab and Dhayra areas ""in order to remove a threat"". Hezbollah said its fighters had fired at Israeli military positions in the northern Israeli communities of Even Menachem, Shomera and Avivim, as well as several locations in the disputed Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov area. Also on Wednesday, Iran's oil minister alleged that Israel was behind two explosions that authorities said had disrupted the country's main north-south gas pipeline network a week ago. ""The explosion of the country's gas lines was the work of Israel,"" Oil Minister Javad Owji told reporters. ""The plot was foiled.""",2024-02-21T14:35:19.000Z

Israel Gaza: China condemns US veto of call for immediate ceasefire at UNPublished21 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"China has sharply criticised the US for vetoing a United Nations (UN) Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Beijing said the move sent the ""wrong message"" and effectively gave a ""green light to the continued slaughter"". The White House said the Algerian-proposed resolution would ""jeopardise"" talks to end the war. The US has proposed its own temporary ceasefire resolution, which also warned Israel not to invade the city of Rafah. Algeria's resolution was backed by 13 of the 15 members of the UN Security Council - with the UK abstaining. Under the council's rules, any resolution that is vetoed by one of its five permanent members - which includes the US - is immediately thrown out. Israel launched its operations in Gaza following an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign has left more than 29,000 people dead in Gaza, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry. More than a million displaced Palestinians - about half of the Strip's population - are crammed into Rafah after being forced to seek shelter there. The southern city, which borders Egypt, was home to only 250,000 people before the war. Many of the displaced are living in makeshift shelters or tents in squalid conditions, with scarce access to safe drinking water or food. The US decision to block Algeria's resolution has been met with widespread condemnation. China's UN ambassador Zhang Jun said the claim that the motion would interfere with diplomatic negotiations was ""totally untenable"". ""Given the situation on the ground, the continued passive avoidance of an immediate ceasefire is nothing different from giving a green light to the continued slaughter,"" he said. ""The spillover of the conflict is destabilising the entire Middle East region, leading to rising risk of a wider war,"" he added. ""Only by extinguishing the flames of war in Gaza can we prevent the fires of hell from engulfing the entire region."" Algeria's top UN diplomat declared that ""unfortunately the Security Council failed once again"". ""Examine your conscience, how will history judge you,"" Amar Bendjama added. Some US allies have also been critical of the decision to veto Algeria's proposed resolution. France's UN envoy Nicolas de Rivière expressed regret that the resolution had not been adopted ""given the disastrous situation on the ground"". Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Washington's ambassador to the UN, said it was not the right time to call for an immediate ceasefire while negotiations between Hamas and Israel were continuing. Her UK counterpart, Barbara Woodward, said the plan could ""actually make a ceasefire less likely"" by endangering talks. The alternative resolution proposed by the US, meanwhile, calls for a temporary ceasefire ""as soon as practicable"" and on the condition that all hostages are released, as well as urging the lifting of barriers on aid reaching Gaza. The White House previously avoided the word ""ceasefire"" during UN votes on the war. It is unclear if or when the Security Council will vote on the proposal. The draft also states that a major ground offensive in Rafah would result in more harm to civilians and their further displacement, including potentially into neighbouring countries - a reference to Egypt. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday he was ""committed to continuing the war until we achieve all of its goals"" and no pressure could change it. The UN has warned that a planned Israeli offensive in the city could lead to a ""slaughter"". The Israeli military has previously insisted it only targets Hamas fighters. Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz said the ground assault would be launched unless Hamas freed all hostages by 10 March. The failure of Algeria's proposed resolution comes days after Qatar, one of the countries mediating talks aimed at brokering a pause to the fighting in Gaza, saidthey had not been ""very promising"" recently.",2024-02-21T11:01:03.000Z

Awkward choices for Labour over Gaza votePublished21 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Today's debates at Westminster over the UK's outlook on the Israel-Gaza conflict are rooted in domestic politics. The genesis of the whole thing is what is known as an Opposition Day debate which the Scottish National Party have been granted. Even before therow of last week about Labour's candidate in the Rochdale by-electionwho is no longer Labour's candidate, the SNP planned to use this debate to set out what they see as their distinctive position among Westminster's biggest parties at least on the conflict - their desire, going back some time, for an ""immediate ceasefire"". They see themselves as ""Westminster's conscience"" on the issue and wanted to press home that position. The SNP are keenly aware of the political tussle they currently confront: a resurgent Labour Party which threatens their dominance in Scotland and threatens to snaffle a considerable number of current SNP seats at the general election. So pointing out points of difference with Labour is key and they profoundly believe Labour has been in the wrong place for too long, in hugging the government's position very closely and explicitly avoiding calling for an immediate ceasefire. Labour, meanwhile, believe they have a duty to act as a government in waiting and behave as they would if they were in government. But, confronted by this debate, Labour had a choice to make. And yesterday, for the first time, they did say they backed an ""immediate ceasefire"" and so the gap between the SNP and Labour positions narrowed. Senior Labour folk tell me their position is nuanced and also reflects the changing picture in the region and among the UK's allies. Labour say it is an essential condition of a ceasefire that Israel feels secure and there is the prospect of a viable Palestinian state - neither of which are straightforward objectives, however laudable or otherwise. The SNP counter that the two parties' positions are now very close and welcome that. But this is where parliamentary procedure throws up a twist. The government has set out its own position in an amendment to today's debate. It is not changing its position but the language is different from Labour's - despite how close the two frontbenches have been since October. And those within Labour who have been sceptical about Sir Keir Starmer's approach - feeling it has been too pro-Israel and insufficiently focused, until now at least, on a ceasefire - are not likely to be convinced by it. And here's the rub: in debates like this, the convention is the motion itself, the SNP's position, will be voted on, as will the government's position. But not necessarily Labour's. If that comes to pass, what do Labour do? They could choose to abstain, but there is a risk for Sir Keir in that scenario that some of his MPs feel obliged to back the SNP motion to register their desire for an immediate ceasefire. Net result, potentially: Labour looks divided. Now, you might be reading this thinking what on earth has this actually got to do with what is happening in Israel and Gaza? And what difference does any of this make to the UK's position on the conflict? The short answer is: it will make no difference. The longer answer is Labour is a party that aspires to be in government in a matter of months, and has found itself in some awkwardness at the very least ever since the Hamas atrocities in Israel in October. That awkwardness continues - as we see in Rochdale. And Labour's two biggest opponents - who themselves argue they have clear, consistent (albeit different) positions - are not averse to pointing out Labour's difficulty on one of the biggest foreign policy issues of the day.",2024-02-21T10:46:08.000Z

Labour calls for immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza for first timePublished21 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Labour has called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza for the first time since the outbreak of the conflict in October. The move comes after days of party debate on how to vote in Parliament on an SNP motion calling for a ceasefire. Ten Labour frontbenchers quit in order to vote for the SNP's previous call for a ceasefire in November. Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said Labour had shifted because the situation in Gaza had ""evolved"". Mr Lammy said Labour was ""mirroring the language"" of the UN and the remaining members of the Five Eyes alliance - made up of the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada's intelligence services. On Tuesday, Labour tabled an amendment, which for the first time uses the phrase ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", to the SNP's ceasefire motion. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer has for some time beencalling for the fighting to stop""now"". It means that in effect Labour's position is now much closer to the SNP's - although Labour's amendment emphasises more than the SNP's the role of Hamas as well as Israel in bringing about a lasting ceasefire. A party spokesperson said: ""Our amendment calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, in line with our allies. ""We need the hostages released and returned. We need the fighting to stop now. We need a massive humanitarian aid programme for Gaza. And any military action in Rafah cannot go ahead. ""We want the fighting to stop now. We also have to be clear on how we prevent the violence starting up again. There will be no lasting peace without a diplomatic process that delivers a two-state solution, with a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state."" The issue of which amendment or amendments are voted on is one for Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who will make a decision later this morning. He will take advice from Commons clerks on what to do in accordance with conventions. Some procedural experts believe he is most likely to select only a government amendment. But it is very unusual for both the government and the main opposition party to be trying to amend another opposition party's motion - and, as was seen in the fraught Brexit years, conventions can be flexible. The government amendment calls for an ""immediate humanitarian pause"" in the fighting before ""moves towards a permanent sustainable ceasefire"" that involve Hamas freeing all hostages, relinquishing control of Gaza, and international efforts to create a two-state solution. It ""supports Israel's right to defence, in compliance with international humanitarian law"". Labour has not said how it plans to vote if its own amendment is not voted on. Israel declared war on Hamas after the group led an attack on communities inside Israel, killing around 1,200 people. Since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, more than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed and 69,000 wounded as Israel has launched missiles and ground operations into the Gaza Strip in response. The Israeli Defense Forces says it has killed nearly 12,000 Hamas fighters in Gaza, in addition to more than 1,000 fighters inside Israel. It has not disclosed how it has calculated these figures. Until now the Labour Party's leadership has avoided using the phrase ""immediate ceasefire"", which led to a clear split in the party in November when 56 of Labour's 198 MPs backed an SNP motion. Ten of those were frontbencherswho had to leave their positions for holding views against the party leadership. Sir Keir had instead called for a ""humanitarian pause"" and an end of fighting ""as soon as possible"". Whether or not those positions are substantively different, the crucial political fact is that this is designed to be seen as a slight hardening of Labour's position towards Israel. Clive Betts, who was one of the Labour MPs to defy the leadership in November, said Labour's amendment was ""a really firm, strong statement, which I think the party will unite behind"". However, left-wing campaign group Momentum, said: ""Scratch the surface of this amendment and it falls well short of what the moment requires: a clear call for an immediate ceasefire. ""By making its call for a ceasefire so conditional and caveated, the Labour leadership is giving cover for Israel's brutal war to continue."" Mr Lammy told the BBC that Labour's amendment ""reflects the complexity of the situation"" and the desire for ""a lasting humanitarian ceasefire"". He contrasted this with the SNP motion, which he said ""feels unbalanced"". Lisa Nandy, shadow secretary of state for international development, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It [SNP motion] doesn't lay out any kind of political horizon that would make a ceasefire either achievable or sustainable. ""But secondly it doesn't make clear that this term ceasefire... must be observed by both sides."" Asked if Labour would vote for the SNP's motion if their amendment is not called she said that would be a ""question for the chief whip"". SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn welcomed what he described as a ""long-overdue U-turn"" by Sir Keir. He said the Labour leader was ""forced into this position through public pressure and, in particular, by the SNP"". Mr Flynn also called on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to back an immediate ceasefire. This week, Sir Keir has come under increasing pressure after the Scottish Labour party passed a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Labour's position on Gaza has also come under scrutiny in the upcoming Rochdale by-election, where the partydropped its parliamentary candidateover antisemitic comments he apparently made during a discussion about the conflict. The SNP motion calls for an ""immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel"" as the ""only way to stop the slaughter of innocent civilians"". If passed, the SNP's opposition day motion is not binding on the government. Instead, they typically express opposition MPs' position on a particular issue. The government has also put forward its own amendment, calling for ""an immediate humanitarian pause"" and supporting moves ""towards a permanent sustainable ceasefire"". The move threatens to expose Labour splits over the issue, as it makes it less likely the Commons Speaker will choose the Labour amendment for debate on Wednesday. If this happened it would leave Labour MPs with the choice of voting for the government's position, which does not go as far as calling for an immediate ceasefire, or the SNP's stance. If - as seems likely - Labour were to call for its MPs to abstain on the SNP motion, Mr Lammy made clear ""collective responsibility"" would apply, meaning shadow ministers who vote for it would be expected to resign. Party sources are not anticipating further resignations - but some backbench Labour MPs could still rebel. Additional reporting by Becky Morton",2024-02-21T09:18:13.000Z

WHO fears for remaining patients at Gaza's Nasser hospitalPublished21 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The World Health Organization fears for the safety of 130 patients at Gaza's Nasser hospital, which it declared non-functional following an Israeli raid. The UN agency has led two missions to transfer 32 critically ill Palestinians from the complex in Khan Younis. It says there is no electricity or running water, and that medical waste and garbage pose a disease risk. Israel says its troops are delivering aid to ensure the hospital continues to function while they act against Hamas. According to the Israeli military, they have detained hundreds of ""terrorists"" and found weapons and medicines intended for Israeli hostages held by Hamas since entering the facility last Thursday. Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and others - has denied allegations that its fighters use hospitals for cover, saying they are being used as a pretext to destroy Gaza's healthcare system. Only 11 of the Palestinian territory's 36 hospitals are still partially functional after four months of conflict, while three are functioning at minimal capacity. Meanwhile, the Word Food Programme said it was pausing food deliveries to northern Gaza amid ""complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order"". It warned that the decision, taken after the looting of several trucks and the beating of one of the drivers, meant the ""situation there will deteriorate further and more people risk dying of hunger"". The Israeli military launched a large-scale air and ground campaign in Gaza after Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel on 7 October and took 253 other people hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 29,195 people have been killed in the territory since then, including at least 103 in the past 24 hours. The WHO said in a statementthat its staff had led two high-risk missions on Sunday and Monday to move 23 critical patients, including two children, from the Nasser Medical Complex and provide supplies of medicines and food. Four Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances transported the patients to the European hospital in Khan Younis, al-Aqsa hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, and three field hospitals in the southern city of Rafah. ""Patients transferred during the missions included three suffering from paralysis - two of them with tracheostomy - and several others with external fixators for severe orthopaedic injuries. Two of the paralyzed patients required continuous manual ventilation throughout the journey, due to the lack of portable ventilators,"" it said. WHO staff reported that the destruction around the hospital was ""indescribable"", with burnt and destroyed buildings, heavy layers of debris, and no roads to it still intact. It warned that further disruption to lifesaving care for the estimated 130 sick and injured patients who remain inside the hospital along with at least 15 doctors and nurses would ""lead to more deaths"". The WHO said that before the transfers its staff had twice been denied access to the hospital to carry out medical assessments and that it had received reports of the deaths of at least five patients in the intensive care unit. It called the ""dismantling and degradation"" of Nasser hospital ""a massive blow to Gaza's health care system"". Gaza's health ministry said Israeli forces had converted Nasser hospital into a ""military barracks"" and that the situation there had ""gone beyond a disaster"", posing a direct threat to the lives of the patients and staff. On Monday, the Israeli defence ministry body overseeing policy for the Palestinian territories, Cogat, insisted thatNasser hospital was ""operational during the entire IDF (Israel Defense Forces) activity, despite Hamas operatives posing as medical staff"". ""We facilitated humanitarian aid and supplies to the hospital and co-ordinated a UN team to evacuate the patients,"" it wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The aid deliveries included a UN tanker carrying 24,500 litres of diesel fuel, hundreds of water bottles, ration packs, loaves of bread, a replacement electricity generator and medicines donated by the WHO, it added. On Sunday, the Israeli military said commandos had detained ""hundreds of terrorists and other terror suspects who were hiding in the hospital"", including some who had participated in the 7 October attacks, those with connections to the hostages and significant Hamas operatives. They also found large quantities of weapons, a vehicle used on 7 October and another that belonged to an Israeli kibbutz which was attacked, as well as named boxes of medicine which should have been transferred to Israeli hostages under a deal agreed last month, it added. The Palestinian Red Crescent also warned on Tuesday about the situation at the other major hospital in Khan Younis, al-Amal, where about 180 patients, medics and displaced people remain two weeks after Israeli troops raided it. ""Al-Amal hospital is currently under multiple attacks, as Israeli forces have directly targeted the third floor of the hospital, resulting in the burning of two rooms,""a post on X said. ""Additionally, the hospital's water lines were targeted."" The IDF said it not aware of the incident.",2024-02-21T07:44:00.000Z

Prince William: 'Too many killed' in Israel-Gaza warPublished20 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Prince William has called for an ""end to the fighting as soon as possible"", in a strongly worded intervention on the Israel-Gaza conflict. He has spoken of the ""terrible human cost of the conflict in the Middle East since the Hamas terrorist attack"". The Prince of Wales says there is a ""desperate need for increased humanitarian support to Gaza"" and for hostages to be released. His statement came as he visited the British Red Cross in London. It's understood the government had been briefed about the prince's statement and his visits, via the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. ""Too many have been killed,"" said the prince, who was told by Red Cross workers about the humanitarian efforts to support people caught up in the conflict in the Middle East. He took part in a video link with Red Cross staff in Gaza, who gave him graphic first-hand accounts of their work. The prince heard warnings from senior crisis manager, Pascal Hundt, that without medical supplies or fuel, hospitals risked ""becoming a cemetery"" and that distributing humanitarian aid had become difficult because of looting by ""hungry mobs"". Prince William was also told that the Red Cross was ready to help with the release of hostages. ""It is civilians who pay the price as the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate,"" said Beatrice Butsana-Sita, British Red Cross chief executive. Israel launched its operations in Gaza following an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign has killed 29,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Prince William is carrying out visits this month intended to recognise the human suffering and distress from the Israel-Gaza war. He is said to have felt strongly about what has happened in the Middle East and is ""deeply moved as a father"". ""Sometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home,"" says the prince. The prince's statement was welcomed by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose spokeswoman said: ""We want to see an end to the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible, so it is consistent with the government position."" On another visit to a synagogue later this month Prince William will speak to young people from a range of backgrounds, in a meeting which will draw particular attention to concerns about antisemitism. In response to the prince, Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy said: ""Israelis of course want to see an end to the fighting as soon as possible, and that will be possible once the 134 hostages are released, and once the Hamas terror army threatening to repeat the 7 October atrocities is dismantled."" Britain's chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said Prince William had shown ""deep concern"" for the wellbeing of all those affected by the conflict and said his visit to a synagogue would ""send a powerful message"". The building of bridges between faiths, and tackling religious intolerance, has been a particular cause of the prince's father, King Charles III. But since the King's cancer diagnosis earlier this month, he has not been carrying out such public visits. Last October, the King spoke of the ""heartbreaking loss of life"" in the Middle East conflict and made an impassioned call for respect between different faiths and cultures. And in his Christmas message, he spoke of the underlyinguniversal values shared by religions, at a time of ""tragic conflict"". But with the King stepping back from such public involvement during his cancer treatment, Prince William will be among the senior royals taking on such symbolic and sensitive visits. Prince William's full statement reads: ""I remain deeply concerned about the terrible human cost of the conflict in the Middle East since the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7. Too many have been killed. ""I, like so many others, want to see an end to the fighting as soon as possible. There is a desperate need for increased humanitarian support to Gaza. It's critical that aid gets in and the hostages are released. ""Sometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home. ""Even in the darkest hour, we must not succumb to the counsel of despair. I continue to cling to the hope that a brighter future can be found and I refuse to give up on that.""",2024-02-20T22:14:42.000Z

US vetoes call for immediate Gaza ceasefire at UNPublished20 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The US has vetoed a resolution at the UN demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza after proposing its own draft urging a temporary ceasefire. Washington said the Algerian-proposed resolution would ""jeopardise"" talks to end the war. But the move has been condemned, with US allies expressing regret the original ceasefire motion was blocked by the White House. In its own resolution the US warned Israel not to invade the city of Rafah. The US has previously avoided the word ""ceasefire"" during UN votes on the war, but President Joe Biden has recently made similar comments. Thirteen countries on the 15-member body backed Algeria's resolution, while the UK abstained. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Washington's ambassador to the UN, said it was not the right time to call for an immediate ceasefire while negotiations between Hamas and Israel were continuing. The draft resolution proposed by the US calls for a temporary ceasefire ""as soon as practicable"" and on the condition that all hostages are released, as well as urging barriers on aid reaching Gaza to be lifted. However, it is unclear if or when the Security Council will vote on the form of words proposed by Washington. After the US vetoed Algeria's ceasefire resolution, the north African nation's envoy to the UN said it ""would have sent a strong message to Palestinians"" and declared that ""unfortunately the Security Council failed once again."" ""Examine your conscience, how will history judge you,"" Amar Bendjama said. Palestinian representative to the UN Riyad Mansour said the US veto was ""absolutely reckless and dangerous"". Heavy criticism also came from a series of Israeli and US allies. France's representative, Nicolas de Rivière, expressed regret that the resolution was ""not adopted given the disastrous situation on the ground"". But Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was ""committed to continuing the war until we achieve all of its goals"". ""There is no pressure, none, that can change this,"" he added. Washington has come under immense international pressure to use its leverage to rein in Israel's devastating operations, having spent much of the war emphasising its ally's right to self-defence. Israel would be bound to follow any Security Council resolution, as these are legally binding. This issue distinguishes the Security Council from the General Assembly. It is the first time the US has called for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza at the UN, having vetoed previous resolutions using the word. Frank Lowenstein, who served as US special envoy for Middle East peace under President Obama, called the move ""a pretty significant shift"" in American policy. ""What I think is most significant is what this says about the frustration level the Biden administration has with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli government,"" he told the BBC World Service. ""They've just consistently ignored us when it comes to humanitarian assistance, reducing civilian casualties and now they are dug in on this Rafah invasion that we are strongly counselling against."" Mr Lowenstein also noted that President Biden is under pressure from Arab-Americans to do more to halt the killings of Palestinians. A former Israeli ambassador to the US said the American ceasefire resolution ""is going to be a problem for the Israeli government"". Michael Oren told BBC Newshour a key issue was any temporary ceasefire linked to talks on hostages releases would give ""immense leverage to Hamas"", who could then ""drag out those negotiations"" indefinitely. ""Any Israeli government would not meet those terms, it would mean Hamas wins the war and Israel loses,"" he said. The US draft resolution states that a major ground offensive in Rafah would result in more harm to civilians and their further displacement, including potentially into neighbouring countries - a reference to Egypt. It also says such a move would have serious implications for regional peace and security. More than a million displaced Palestinians, who represent about half of Gaza's population, are crammed into Rafah after being forced to seek shelter there. The southern city, which borders Egypt, was home to only 250,000 people before the war. Many of the displaced are living in makeshift shelters or tents in squalid conditions, with scarce access to safe drinking water or food. The UN has issued its own warning that a planned Israeli offensive in the city could lead to a ""slaughter"". Its aid chief says civilians in Rafah, ""like the entire population of Gaza, are the victims of an assault that is unparalleled in its intensity, brutality and scope"". The UN says women and children continue to be killed in air strikes. The Israeli military has previously insisted it only targets Hamas fighters. Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz has warned the manoeuvre will be launched unless Hamas frees all its hostages by 10 March. The date marks the start of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting. Israel launched its operations in Gaza following an attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign has killed 29,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there.",2024-02-20T22:02:14.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: World Food Programme stops deliveries to northern GazaPublished20 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The World Food Programme has paused ""life-saving"" food deliveries to northern Gaza, saying aid convoys had endured ""complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order"". The agency says the decision has not been taken lightly and crews had faced crowds, gunfire and looting. The UN has been warning oflooming famine in the northsince December. The WFP says these latest reports are proof of a ""precipitous slide into hunger and disease"". The Israeli military ordered 1.1 million Palestinian civilians to evacuate all areas north of Wadi Gaza and seek shelter in the south at the start of its ground offensive in October. The evacuation area included Gaza City - which before the war was the most densely populated area of the territory. Most residents followed the Israeli order, but several hundred thousand chose to stay or were unable to flee as Israeli troops encircled the region and then largely took control of Hamas strongholds there. Last month the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said at least 300,000 people who had remained in northern Gaza depended on its assistance for their survival. Aid deliveries to the north have been scarce and dependent on security clearances from the Israeli military. This weekend the WFP had hoped to begin a week-long delivery, sending 10 lorries each day to help ""stem the tide of hunger and desperation"". But on Sunday, as a convoy neared the Wadi Gaza checkpoint on its way north, it was ""surrounded by crowds of hungry people"" with ""multiple attempts by people to climb aboard"" and then on entering Gaza City faced gunfire, ""high tension and explosive anger"". Additionally, several lorries driving between the southern city of Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah had been looted and a driver beaten. The WFP said over the past two days its teams had ""witnessed unprecedented levels of desperation"" in the Gaza Strip. ""Food and safe water have become incredibly scarce and diseases are rife, compromising women and children's nutrition and immunity and resulting in a surge of acute malnutrition,"" it said. ""People are already dying from hunger-related causes,"" it added. A joint report issued by the WFP and the UN's children's agency UNICEF on Monday found that the the situation was ""particularly extreme"" in the north of Gaza. Nutrition screenings conducted at shelters and health centres in the north found that more than 15% of children under two years of age were ""acutely malnourished"", the WFP said. The agency said it would seek ways to resume deliveries in a ""responsible manner"" as soon as possible and urged a major expansion of aid to northern Gaza. It said this would require significantly higher volumes of food entering Gaza from multiple routes and called for crossing points between Israel and northern Gaza to be opened. It also called for a functioning humanitarian notification system, a stable communication network and security for its staff and partners as well as for Gazans themselves. ""Gaza is hanging by a thread and WFP must be enabled to reverse the path towards famine for thousands of desperately hungry people,"" it says. Meanwhile, the UN human rights office said it was ""continuing to closely monitor the situation"" when asked about a statement from seven independent UN experts expressing concern about reports of violence by Israeli forces against Palestinian women and girls in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Reem Alsalem, an expert on violence against women and girls, and Francesca Albanese, an expert on human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, said they were ""appalled"" by the ""credible allegations"", including that women and girls had been killed extrajudicially in Gaza while seeking refuge or fleeing, and that others detained in Gaza and the West Bank had been ""subjected to multiple forms of sexual assault, such as being stripped naked and searched by male Israeli army officers"". ""At least two female Palestinian detainees were reportedly raped while others were reportedly threatened with rape and sexual violence,""they added, without providing further details. Israel's mission to the UN in Genevarejected the ""despicable and unfounded claims""and accused the experts of being ""motivated by their hatred for Israel, not by the truth"". In a statement on Tuesday the UN human rights office said: ""We reiterate that Israel must comply fully with the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice, and ensure full accountability for the conduct of its military and security forces."" Israel launched its operations in Gaza following an attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign against Hamas has killed 29,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there.",2024-02-20T19:16:03.000Z

'Evacuating was a mistake': Israelis push to return to border homesPublished20 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Ayelet Kohn and Shachar Shnurman harvested the grapefruits this month - a defiant act of normality amid the burnt-out remains of their neighbours' homes. The juice, sharp and vivid, is stored in plastic bottles for the weekly barbecues at their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Soldiers are their only guests. Kfar Aza - only 2km (1.2 miles) from Gaza - was one of the first places targeted by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in co-ordinated attacks that killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel, and saw more than 240 others taken hostage. In the days that followed, the community was evacuated to hotels and apartments in other parts of Israel. Ayelet and Shachar are the first to move back. ""In the evening, it's very lonely,"" Ayelet says. ""You used to see people walking along the road, coming in to say hello - obviously that's not happening now."" During the day, the kibbutz is full of visiting groups: new army recruits, potential donors, journalists, humanitarian organisations. Kfar Aza has become a kind of museum - its burned and broken houses left frozen on the day of the attack, their entrances roped-off; debris and belongings scattered across the ground. When the tour groups leave, the couple sit on their veranda, the silence broken only by the whine of Israeli army drones and the regular boom of outgoing artillery. The kibbutz dark, the houses empty. Ayelet points to the house opposite and to another further up the road. ""Our next-door neighbour, who was a very good friend, was murdered,"" she says. ""It's a constant reminder of all the others."" So far, they are the only members of the kibbutz to move back full-time. The shock of 7 October is still fresh for many residents here. And the ongoing war in Gaza, sparked by those attacks, is close enough that the destruction in places like Beit Hanoun is visible from the kibbutz border fence. The challenge for the Israeli prime minister is how to restore a sense of security, as the costs of the country's displaced communities - both political and financially - rise, month by month. After the attacks, 200,000 people were evacuated from Israel's border areas - both the southern border with Gaza and the northern border with Lebanon, where the Iran-backed group Hezbollah, in support of Hamas, has been exchanging fire with Israeli forces. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu built a political career on being the strongman who could defend Israel from its enemies. Empty border communities are a daily reminder of that failure to protect. ""We bought into the con,"" Ayelet says. ""Maybe they convinced themselves that what they were saying was the truth. But, obviously, it was a lie. And we all bought into it."" After the war is over, she says, something will have to change. ""The way the army is [organised], the way the government does business with the Palestinians, maybe the way the world treats the whole situation - a lot will have to change."" Mr Netanyahu has insisted that only ""total victory"" in Gaza, and the destruction of Hamas as an organised force, will provide security for Israel in the future. But victory has not been quick. The war has killed almost 30,000 Gazans, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and the prime minister is under growing pressure to agree a ceasefire deal to ease Gaza's suffering and free more than 100 hostages still being held by Hamas. He has so far refused. ""It's not like we're going to kill the idea of fighting against Israel,"" Ayelet says. ""If Hamas aren't there, there will be someone else like Hamas - so I don't see the difference."" The couple have hung a large black flag from their veranda, in solidarity with the hostages - 19 of them from Kfar Aza. ""The kidnapped people in Gaza have to come home - now,"" Ayelet says. ""And for that, there needs to be a deal. If that means stopping the war, they need to stop the war."" And, as the war grinds on with no clear plan for the day-after in Gaza, the question of how to repair a sense of security on Israel's northern border is even more fraught. More than 200km (120 miles) away from the Gaza border, at a holiday resort on the Sea of Galilee, Michael Piha agrees that something in Israel's border communities needs to change. ""Perhaps the biggest mistake was the evacuation,"" he says, ""because now people realise they can't go back"". ""Until now, it was part of our life on the border - sometimes it's quiet, sometimes there's tension - we got used to it,"" he explained. ""But it's no longer an option to be under the threat of some guy in Beirut that would pull the trigger any time he likes."" Michael is one of 400 residents evacuated from Kibbutz Sasa, a hilly community 3km (1.9 miles) from the Lebanese border. The school there took a direct hit from a Hezbollah missile, he told me. Luckily, it happened after the school had closed and the pupils evacuated. Over the past four months, residents have been living in small holiday cottages, not made for the winter rain and pale mist that shrouds the lake's shoreline. The kibbutz school has been set up here, along with the clinic and a car-pooling system. Freshly-made food is driven an hour from Sasa each day, to help keep a sense of normality. Residents have been told they might be able to move back home at the end of June. But no-one is sure how that will happen. Tensions along the border are worsening, and Israel's army and politicians have warned that the ""diplomatic clock"" is running out. They pointedly broadcast threats to push Hezbollah back from the Lebanese side of the border using military force if international mediation doesn't produce results. But while Prime Minister Netanyahu appears firmly committed to ground operations in Gaza, here in the north, war would be a last resort. Hezbollah - better-equipped and better-trained than Hamas - is a different kind of enemy, and this would be a different kind of war. The costs to Israel would be far higher, with many more people evacuated from northern areas of the country. But pressure to return residents to Israel's frontiers is rising. ""I don't care how he does it,"" Michael Piha says. ""But [this situation] has to end in a clear-cut way, so that we can live safely in a normal way - no more missiles along the border."" In the southern communities along the Gaza border, a few people are slowly beginning to return. The outgoing leader of Israel's Kibbutz Movement, Nir Meir, told Israel's Haaretz newspaper that members of Kibbutz Or Haner were due to return at the end of the month, and that the movement had been receiving ""a stream of applications from people of all classes and all ages"". In Kibbutz Be'eri, they have begun clearing the rubble and damaged houses in preparation for rebuilding. And in Kfar Aza, Ayelet and Shachar have begun seeing neighbours flitting in and out to collect belongings or inspect the damage to their homes. The attacks have thrown the contract in Israel's border communities into sharp relief. ""[These communities] offered the best quality of life at a low price, in exchange for a red alert siren once a week, a missile once a month,"" Nir Meir said. ""Now the risk has risen - there's also a chance of a massacre."" Shachar adds: ""We hope the army has learned something, and keeps a few soldiers between here and Gaza."" Who knows how they would feel in a few months' time, he says, but right now ""we've got 10,000 soldiers between us and Gaza - this is the safest place in Israel"".",2024-02-20T06:01:09.000Z

Israel's Rafah deadline raises stakes as Ramadan approachesPublished19 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel's sudden threat to unleash its controversial ground operation in the southern Gazan town of Rafah unless all hostages are freed by 10 March has ratcheted up the pressure on the tortuous talks to secure an elusive agreement. Even before Benny Gantz, a leading member of Israel's war cabinet,threw down the gauntlet, Arab leaders were already anxiously focused on this start of the Islamic holy month - a time of communal fasting and prayer which can intensify a prevailing mood. ""Ramadan is ahead of us and if the situation in Rafah evolves, it will be a very, very dangerous time in the region,"" warned Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani at the annual Munich Security Conference over the weekend. The palpable apprehension by an Arab leader directly involved in the protracted negotiations to swap Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and reach a truce in this grievous war, is being forcefully echoed by other Arab officials. Their principal preoccupation is the highly combustible situation in the occupied West Bank, where tensions and violence have been steadily escalating. ""The West Bank is a powder keg waiting to explode and, if it does, it is game over,"" stressed Jordan's Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi in a BBC interview in Munich on Sunday, before Israel seemed to set a deadline. Conversations in Munich with several Arab and western officials with knowledge of these high-stake talks underscored a bleak prognosis. They all spoke off the record because of the sensitive nature of the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas involving US, Egyptian and Israeli spy chiefs, as well as Qatar. ""The gaps are still wide,"" regretted one source. Another described the process as ""stuck"". The main stumbling blocks are said to include Hamas's high price for the release of the hostages. A figure of 1,500 Palestinian prisoners for five female Israeli soldiers was cited by one source as one example. In the first swap in November during a one-week truce, 105 hostages - mainly elderly women and young children - were swapped for 240 Palestinians, many of them teenagers, detained in Israeli prisons. About 130 hostages are said to be still in captivity in Gaza, although a small number are believed to have been killed in this war. It was always known that Hamas would hike the price to release Israeli soldiers, who they see as one of its most valuable bargaining chips. Sources say negotiators have been trying to bring down these numbers by introducing other incentives such as increased deliveries of desperately needed humanitarian aid. Hamas's broader demand for an end to this war and the pull-out of all Israeli troops are utterly unacceptable to Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected Hamas's proposed plan as ""delusional"". Negotiators have been searching for a less controversial form of words, including ""restoring calm"". Israel is also said to be adding new issues to the negotiating table, including its accusation that Hamas failed to deliver medicines to hostages as part of an earlier initiative mediated by Qatar and France. Mr Netanyahu has also been criticised for holding back on presenting any counterproposals until Hamas comes back with more acceptable offers. Hamas first put forward its own proposal in early February, which included a three-stage ceasefire and a phased release of hostages in exchange for prisoners and humanitarian aid over 135 days. ""That's why we have negotiations,"" insisted Jordan's Mr Safadi, who accused the Israeli leader of walking away from the talks. ""There are a lot of people who are trying very hard to get a deal."" Beyond the details of any agreement, some players are vexed that Hamas will claim credit for hugely important Palestinian issues such as prisoner releases. It is yet another element complicating this highly charged crisis. Those who insist a deal is still doable point out that both Hamas and Israel would benefit from a truce - even if it is only temporary. Israel is under mounting pressure, especially from its staunchest ally the United States, to create a ""credible plan"" to evacuate more than a million Gazans now squeezed into Rafah. About half of Gaza's population, displaced many times over during this punishing war, are now living in tents. In the midst of Israeli declarations it must send its troops into Rafah to complete its operation to ""destroy Hamas"", Egypt has beenstrengthening defences along its border, including the construction of a walled enclosure. Satellite images showing an area of roughly eight square miles fenced by seven-metre high walls have provoked speculation that Cairo is preparing for a worst case scenario - that thousands of Palestinians will have nowhere else to seek refuge except across the border. ""The risk is speculative, but it exists,"" Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry admitted to me in Munich while trying to downplay the significance of Egypt's move. He reiterated the call being sounded with growing urgency by a chorus of Arab and western leaders, as well as aid organisations, for Israel to halt any plans for a Rafah ground operation which would create a ""humanitarian catastrophe"". The US - which is playing a pivotal role in this process - has been pressing for a hostage deal and a humanitarian pause which it hopes can evolve into a more permanent ceasefire. Washington and its Arab allies also view it as a vital breathing space to focus on a highly ambitious plan for the ""day after"" the war ends. That vision - including a Palestinian state, a reformed Palestinian Authority and the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia - would do nothing less than redraw the political map of the Middle East. For now, minds are concentrated on the growing urgency to find a way out of this mounting crisis in the next few weeks.",2024-02-19T17:12:00.000Z

"Israeli PM 'missed chance' to cut off Hamas cash, says ex-spy chiefPublished19 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Israel's prime minister missed the chance to starve Hamas of cash, years before its murderous attack last October, according to a former senior Israeli intelligence officer. Udi Levy has told BBC Panorama he advised Benjamin Netanyahu to target Hamas's finances. He believes this would have hampered the group's military build-up, but says the intelligence was not acted upon. The Israeli prime minister's office has not responded to the allegations. Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages on 7 October last year, when they crossed into southern Israel. One hundred and thirty hostages remain unaccounted for. Israel's military response has killed 29,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Mr Levy - who was head of economic warfare in the Mossad, Israel's spy agency, until 2016 - says he told Mr Netanyahu many times that Israel had the means to crush Hamas, which controls Gaza, ""by using only financial tools"". Mr Levy says he never got a response to his proposal from Mr Netanyahu. When asked if he considered there was a connection between Mr Netanyahu's alleged reluctance to deal with Hamas's finances and the 7 October attack, Mr Levy is unequivocal. ""Yes, of course,"" he says. ""There is a very good chance that... we would [have] prevent[ed] a lot of the money"" that had gone into Gaza, and that ""the monster that Hamas built probably [wouldn't be] like the same monster that we faced on October 7th."" Hamas would have needed ""billions, not millions"" of dollars, says the former spy chief, to build hundreds of kilometres of tunnels underneath Gaza and pay for an estimated 30,000-strong military force. One specific funding stream, which Mr Levy says he raised with Mr Netanyahu in 2014, was an alleged multi-million-dollar investment portfolio which Israeli intelligence said was controlled by Hamas and managed out of Turkey. Mr Levy says that Mr Netanyahu chose not to act on the information. Hamas's secret financial empire Following the attacks of 7 October, Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. But can it? With access to some of Hamas's most closely guarded secrets, John Ware investigates its network outside Gaza. Watch on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 19 February (20:30 in Northern Ireland and 22:40 in Wales) or onBBC iPlayer Hamas, which rejects Israel's right to exist and is committed to its destruction, is much more than just a military force. It's a political movement with financial support extending well beyond Gaza. ""We spoke about Qatar and Iran as the main sponsors,"" says Mr Levy of his conversations with Mr Netanyahu. ""Turkey is even, in some aspect, more important because it is a critical focal point for Hamas to manage [its] financial infrastructure."" Panorama has been investigating documents, which had been acquired in 2020, said to reveal the extent of Hamas's investment portfolio. They are a snapshot of an eight-month period that ends in early 2018. Israeli intelligence says they show how Hamas makes some of its money. Some 40 companies across the Middle East and north Africa are believed to be in the portfolio, including Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Sudan, Egypt, the Gulf and also Turkey. The alleged investments include everything from road construction, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment to tourism, mining, gold prospecting and luxury real estate projects. Since 2022, six of the companies listed in the documents have been designated by the US Treasury as being directly or indirectly owned or controlled by Hamas. The US has restricted their ability to trade by sanctioning them. Next to each company listed in the portfolio ledger is what is said to be the value of each Hamas-controlled holding, running into the millions of dollars for some of the companies - and adding up to a total value of $422,573,890 (£335m). Much of that value is said to be tied up in real estate. Property investments, which hold their value and have the potential for rental income, are a ""perfect way"" for an organisation such as Hamas to manage its finances, says Tom Keatinge, founding director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies (CFCS) at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). One of the companies sanctioned by the US is Trend GYO - a Turkish real estate firm. In the 2018 document, it is referenced several times as Anda Turk - which documents show was an old trading name, before it was renamed Trend and floated on the Istanbul stock exchange. The 7 October attacks or, as Hamas calls them, ""Operation Al-Aqsa Flood"", were recently praised by Trend's former chairman, Hamid Abdullah al-Ahmar - who stood down in 2022 but remains as the head of Trend's parent company. Speaking at a conference in Istanbul in January 2024, he was filmed saying: ""We meet... while the Aqsa Flood is at its peak, a sweeping and roaring flood that will never stop before the occupation of beloved Palestine is defeated."" He went on to call on the conference to ""work to criminalise Zionism as a racist and terrorist movement"". Panorama wrote to Mr al-Ahmar but received no reply. Trend told us that the US Treasury's allegations of links between the company and Hamas were ""unfair and unfounded"". The Turkish authorities have said they have investigated Trend and found ""no abuse of our nation's financial system"" and that Turkey abides by international financial rules. Hamas, however, has also had a variety of other long-term financial sources. One of its most important early fundraisers was Yahya Sinwar, now the head of Hamas's political wing in Gaza. According to Israel, he began raising funds for Hamas while he was in an Israeli prison cell. In 1988, Sinwar had been jailed for murdering Palestinians he suspected were spying for Israel. Micha Koubi, a former Israel security agency officer says he interrogated Sinwar for more than 150 hours. He said Sinwar managed to forge links with Iran by sending covert messages from prison. In 2007, a year after Hamas was voted into power, Israel and its neighbour Egypt tightened the blockade on Gaza, both saying they were concerned about their security. Mr Koubi said that Sinwar's Iranian connections helped him to beat the blockade. ""He sent messengers to Iran, to start the contact. He asked them to send... weapons and arms. And they agreed to help [Hamas] with everything that they need. ""That was the very beginning."" Cash for Hamas also arrived from the Gulf state of Qatar, both overtly and covertly, according to former Mossad officer, Udi Levy. Israel has acknowledged that some of that money was delivered in cash with its blessing. It was allocated to pay the salaries of officials in the Hamas government and provide humanitarian support for the people of Gaza. ""The Qataris [had] a special envoy that came every month, with a private jet to Rafah with a suitcase, enter to Gaza, gave it to Hamas, say hello and go back, that's it,"" says Mr Levy. He has told Panorama he believes ""a significant sum of this money"" went to ""support Hamas's military arm"". Billions more had been provided by UN agencies, the EU, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and numerous charities. All intended for humanitarian purposes. Rusi's Tom Keatinge calls it a ""fair assessment"" that this money may have been subsidising Hamas's military wing. ""It is money [Hamas] can use on other issues, like building tunnels, like arming its military,"" he says. It is impossible to know how much donor cash - if any - Hamas may have appropriated for military purposes. The group denies diverting any aid money. It told Panorama its military wing had its own sources of income. Israel's Prime Minister has beenclear about his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state, and how that strategic aim was linked to his position on Hamas funding. In 2019, Mr Netanyahu told colleagues in his ruling Likud party: ""Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas… This is part of our strategy - to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank."" Keeping Hamas strong enough to be an effective rival to Fatah - its West Bank rival - would prevent the possibility of a ""unified Palestinian leadership with whom you would have to negotiate some kind of final settlement"", says Khaled Elgindy, senior fellow on Palestine and Palestinian-Israeli Affairs at the Middle East Institute think tank in Washington DC. More recently, Mr Netanyahu has denied he wanted to build up Hamas and said he had only allowed Qatari money into Gaza to prevent a humanitarian crisis. Mr Netanyahu has now vowed to destroy Hamas. There will be ""no element"" in Gaza that finances terrorism, he says. But, by destroying so much of Gaza and killing so many Palestinian, Israel may achieve the opposite effect. ""Iran will probably continue to arm and financially support Hamas,"" says Mr Elgindy. ""But more than that, as long as there is a reason for a group like Hamas to try to acquire those weapons, and those resources, and those capabilities, they will do that. ""Because the justification for it, the reasons for it, are still in place.""",2024-02-19T17:04:09.000Z

Israel's economy shrinks more than expected on Gaza warPublished19 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel's economy shrank by far more than expected in the wake of conflict with Hamas in Gaza, according to official figures. Gross domestic product (GDP) - a key measure of a country's economic health - fell by 19% on an annualised basis in the fourth quarter of 2023. That is the equivalent of a fall of 5% between October and December. GDP was ""directly affected"" by the outbreak of the conflict on 7 October, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. Israel and Hamas have been at war after gunmen from the Palestinian group launched an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza - the deadliest in Israel's history. About 1,200 people were killed during the attack. Hamas, which is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the US, the European Union and the UK, also took more than 250 men, women and children hostage. An Israeli military campaign has followed, which has killed 29,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. Experts said the data released on Monday by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics was much worse than had been expected. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts was for an annualised decline of 10.5%. The Central Bureau of Statistics said the war had sharply curtailed spending, travel and investment at the end of last year. It said private spending dropped by 26.3%, exports fell by 18.3% and there had been a 67.8% slide in investment in fixed assets, especially in residential buildings. The construction sector suffered from a lack of labour, due to military call-ups and a reduction in Palestinian workers. Meanwhile, government spending, mainly on war expenses and compensating businesses and households, jumped by 88.1%. Despite the sharp drop in GDP between October and December, Israel's economy grew by 2% for the full year. However, before the 7 October attacks, it had been expected to expand by 3.5%. Liam Peach, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said the contraction of Israel's economy was ""much worse than had been expected and highlights the extent of the hit from the Hamas attacks and the war in Gaza"". He said the country's growth outlook for 2024 ""now looks likely to post one of its weakest rates on record"". Elsewhere, the conflict has affected trade. Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have been targeting cargo ships on the Red Sea that are heading to the Suez Canal. Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Monday that the attacks had cut Suez Canal revenue by between 40% and 50% this year. The Red Sea is one of the world's most important routes for cargo - almost 15% of global seaborne trade usually passes through the area. The Houthis have been carrying out strikes from bases in Yemen on ships which they claim are Israeli-owned, flagged or operated, or are heading to Israeli ports. However, the owners and operators of many vessels claim they have no links with Israel at all. The US and the UK have carried out retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen in turn. But even before this, some of the world's largest shipping companies had stopped their vessels from passing through the strait.",2024-02-19T17:01:16.000Z

Munich security talks marked by global 'lose-lose' anxietyPublished19 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsWar in Ukraine,"It's called the Munich Rule: engage and interact; don't lecture or ignore one another. But this year, at the 60th Munich Security Conference (MSC), two of the most talked-about people weren't even here. That included former US President Donald Trump, whose possible return to the White House could throw a spanner in the work of the transatlantic relationship, which lies at the heart of this premier international forum. And Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who was vehemently blamed by one world leader after another for the death of his most prominent critic Alexei Navalny, not to mention his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which continues to cast a long dark shadow across Europe and far beyond. The staggering news of Navalny's death, which broke just hours before the conference kicked off on Friday, underlined again the perilous unpredictability of a world carved up by multiple fault lines and entrenched interests. ""We live in a world where there is more and more confrontation and less co-operation,"" regretted the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell. ""The world has become a much more dangerous place,"" he told me as the conference drew to a close on Sunday. ""Lose-Lose?"" was the maxim of this year's gathering, at a time of deepening geopolitical tensions and jarring economic uncertainties. The MSC's annual report warned that it could give rise to ""lose-lose"" dynamics among governments, ""a downwards spiral that jeopardises co-operation and undermines the existing international order"". ""I think this has been the conference of a disordered world,"" reflected David Miliband, the CEO and president of the International Rescue Committee (IRC). ""It's a world dominated by impunity, where the guardrail stabilisers are not working and that's why there's so much disorder, not just in Ukraine and in Gaza and Israel, but more widely in places like Sudan, whose humanitarian crisis isn't even getting on the agenda,"" he said. This issue of impunity, one of the toughest of political challenges, was suddenly transformed into a poignant personal story when Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, unexpectedly appeared on the conference's main stage in the grand Bayerischer Hof hotel to condemn Russia's president and urge the assembled presidents, prime ministers, defence chiefs and top diplomats to bring him to justice. Her remarkable composure and clarity stunned the packed hall, which gave her a sustained standing ovation before and after she spoke with palpable pain. This year Russia, as well as Iran, weren't invited to Munich because the organisers assessed they weren't ""interested in meaningful dialogue"". In MSC forums gone by, vitriolic speeches by Russia's veteran Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov angered and electrified the main hall, and Iran's visible presence highlighted the rivalries and risks in urgent need of resolution. The imperative of continuing hefty Western military and financial assistance to Ukraine was underscored repeatedly by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who exhorted participants to act, as he rushed from one high-level meeting to the next. ""The year of 2024 demands your response - from everyone in the world,"" he beseeched delegates when he spoke from the top podium. The US's pivotal support was uppermost in his mind as a vital security package, amounting to $60bn (£48bn), is being held up by a US Congress where Republican lawmakers are increasingly divided over whether to keep backing Kyiv in its fight. Back home in Ukraine, soldiers are even running out of bullets on front lines. US delegates in Munich, including Vice-President Kamala Harris, were at pains to insist that she and President Joe Biden would not abandon Ukraine, nor America's leadership in global affairs. But with US elections just nine months away, Mr Trump is already shaping the polarised political debate in Washington and reviving anxiety that he could pull the US out of the Nato military alliance and other international commitments. ""They know what they need to do but they can't get it done, and that's the gap that has to be filled,"" was how Mr Miliband assessed pledges voiced by the US and European allies in Munich. Others were even more stinging in their criticism. ""Lots of words. No concrete commitments,"" posted Nathalie Tocci, Director of the Institute of International Affairs, on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""It's a sad MSC2024."" The gaps were even more glaring when it came to the devastating Israel-Gaza war, which erupted after Hamas's murderous assault on southern Israel on 7 October. Israel's military operations are causing a staggering number of civilian casualties and have ravaged much of this coastal strip. ""We have seen a really great interest from the international community and the world leaders who have gathered here in Munich that they would like to see a serious ceasefire and a substantial amount of international aid into Gaza,"" Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh remarked in an interview. But Israeli delegates, including former peace negotiator Tzipi Livni, doubled down on the need to keep pressing forward. ""I'm a political opponent of [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, but I support the war in Gaza,"" she emphasised in a session, which also included Mr Shtayyeh and the Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi. ""I support the strategic need to eliminate Hamas as a terrorist organisation and as a regime,"" Ms Livni said. This year's MSC marked a record attendance: more than 900 participants including some 50 heads of state and government from around the world, more than 100 ministers, as well as representatives of think-tanks, non-governmental organisations and leading businesses. Top spooks, feminist foreign ministers, climate warriors, Iranian activists, weapons experts, technology wizards and more - all gathered for their own get-togethers on public stages and in private rendezvous and hushed huddles. It all underlined how the world's understanding of ""global security"" keeps shifting shape. Over the decades, this forum - born in 1963 in a Cold War quest for peace and prosperity - has often been a venue for real-time diplomacy, too. But in a year marked by worry over ""lose-lose dynamics"" Munich was a place for a lot of talking and taking stock as the world nervously wonders where the next blows will fall.",2024-02-19T02:53:23.000Z

Israel indicates March deadline for Gaza ground offensive in RafahPublished19 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz has warned that unless Hamas frees all hostages held in Gaza by 10 March an offensive will be launched in Rafah. It is the first time Israel has said when its troops might enter Gaza's overcrowded southern city. Global opposition is growing to such an attack in Rafah, where some 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering. Earlier, the UN public health agency said a key Gaza hospital had ceased to function following an Israeli raid. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it had not been allowed to enter Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis,north of Rafah, to assess the situation. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) entered the complex on Thursday, saying intelligence indicated hostages taken by Hamas were being held there. The IDF has described its operation in Nasser as ""precise and limited"", accusing Hamas of ""cynically using hospitals for terror"". Speaking on Sunday, Mr Gantz, a former defence minister, said: ""The world must know, and Hamas leaders must know - if by Ramadan our hostages are not home, the fighting will continue everywhere, to include the Rafah area"". Ramadan - the Islamic holy month of fasting - this year begins on 10 March. Mr Gantz added that Israel would act in ""a co-ordinated manner, facilitating the evacuation of civilians in dialogue with our American and Egyptian partners to minimise civilian casualties"". The Israeli war cabinet consists of the country's top security officials. It was formed several days after Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October, killing at least 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages. Hamas is still holding about 130 hostages in Gaza, Israel believes. Mr Gantz's reference to Egypt may serve to heighten speculation that Israel expects some Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip and seek shelter on the Egyptian side of the border, where the authorities appear to be building a large walled enclosure for this purpose, says the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams. But Israeli officials have yet to give any details of an evacuation plan, he adds. With exactly three weeks to go before the start of Ramadan, reports from Rafah say that a few people are leaving, heading west towards the coast, but that most are still waiting, unsure what to do. Despite international pressure, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to launch a ground assault on Rafah to eliminate Hamas gunmen there. Egypt and some other Arab countries have repeatedly warned that an Israeli offensive there would risk pushing many Palestinians into Egypt - which they consider unacceptable. Saudi Arabia has vowed ""very serious repercussions"" if Rafah is stormed. Internationally there have been many warnings to Israel not to launch an offensive in Gaza's southernmost city, where Palestinians are living in dire conditions. The US - a key Israeli ally - has said that launching an operation into the city without proper planning would be a ""disaster"". Israel's offensive against Hamas since 7 October has reduced much of the Gaza Strip to ruins. More than 28,400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed and more than 68,000 wounded since the war began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry says at least 127 Palestinians have been killed and 205 others injured in the past 24 hours. Despite the continued fighting in Gaza, efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamashave been taking place in Cairo in recent days- although Qatari mediators said progress was ""not very promising"". Mr Netanyahu said he sent negotiators following a request from US President Joe Biden, but added they did not return for further discussions because Hamas's demands were ""delusional"". Hamas has blamed Israel for a lack of progress towards achieving a ceasefire deal.",2024-02-19T00:50:48.000Z

WHO says Gaza's Nasser hospital not functional after Israel raidsPublished18 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The World Health Organization has said Gaza's Nasser hospital has ceased to function following an Israeli raid. Israel Defense Force (IDF) troops entered the complex on Thursday, saying intelligence indicated hostages taken by Hamas were being held there. The WHO said it had not been allowed to enter the site to assess the situation. The IDF has described its operation in Nasser as ""precise and limited"" and accused Hamas of ""cynically using hospitals for terror"". Writing on X, formerly Twitter, WHO head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Nasser hospital in Gaza is not functional anymore, after a week-long siege followed by the ongoing raid."" ""Both yesterday and the day before, the WHO team was not permitted to enter the hospital to assess the conditions of the patients and critical medical needs, despite reaching the hospital compound to deliver fuel alongside partners,"" he said. ""There are still about 200 patients in the hospital. At least 20 need to be urgently referred to other hospitals to receive health care; medical referral is every patient's right."" The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says only four medical staff were left in the hospital trying to care for the remaining patients. The BBC has not been able to access the hospital and has been unable to independently verify the situation there. One source inside the hospital, who did not want to be named, told BBC News that 11 patients had died due to interruptions in the supply of electricity and oxygen, and that several doctors had been arrested. The Israeli military said no-one died as a result of its actions, adding that its troops had been told to keep the hospital running. It said diesel and oxygen supplies had been taken to the facility, and that a temporary generator was operating. ‘Without painkillers, we leave patients to scream for hours’ Fighting has raged around the Nasser site for weeks. Israel has repeatedly claimed Hamas is using hospitals, along with schools, as operational bases. The Israeli military says it has killed about 20 Hamas fighters and seized numerous weapons in the area of the hospital. ""Over the past day, dozens of terrorists were eliminated and large quantities of weapons were seized,"" the IDF said. At least 1,200 people were killed during attacks in Israel by Hamas-led gunmen on 7 October last year. In response, Israel launched a military campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 28,400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed and more than 68,000 wounded since the war began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It added that at least 127 Palestinians have been killed and 205 others injured in the past 24 hours. Despite the continued fighting in Gaza, efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamashave been taking place in Cairo in recent days- although Qatari mediators said recent progress was ""not very promising"". ""The pattern in the last few days [is] not really very promising but, as I always repeat, we will always remain optimistic and will always remain pushing,"" said Sheik Mohammed, speaking at a meeting of world leaders at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he sent negotiators following a request from US President Joe Biden, but added they did not return for further discussions because Hamas's demands were ""delusional"". Hamas has blamed Israel for a lack of progress in achieving a ceasefire deal. The group has laid out a series of conditions, including the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, full withdrawal of Israel's forces and an end to the war after a135-day pause in fighting, broken into three phases. Mr Netanyahu has also reiterated the Israeli government is continuing to push its ground invasion of Gaza further south, taking in the area of Rafah, despite international pressure not to do so without first having a plan to evacuate Palestinian civilians who fled there during the early days of the war. Some 1.5 million people are in Rafah, close to the border with Egypt, after being told by Israeli forces to seek safety there while Hamas targets were attacked in northern, then central, Gaza. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday reiterated his opposition to any forced displacement of Palestinians into Egypt's Sinai desert. In a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, both leaders agreed instead on the ""necessity of the swift advancement of a ceasefire"", according to a summary. Mr Sisi has long maintained that the only solution is an independent state for Palestinians. However, on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu announced that his government had unanimously voted to formally oppose what it called the ""unilateral recognition"" of Palestinian statehood. He said any such agreement must be reached through direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. ""Israel rejects outright international dictates regarding a permanent accord with the Palestinians. An accord, should it be reached, will only come through direct negotiations between the sides, without preconditions,"" a government statement said.",2024-02-18T20:19:44.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: Relief and guilt after Gazans find safety in EgyptPublished18 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"They cried all the way. Tala Abu Nahla, her mum, and little sister. Tala's brother Yazeed, aged 17, could feel their emotion. He is disabled and has epileptic seizures. She calmed him in the way she knew how. Tala spoke softly and caressed his hands and pushed him across the border in his wheelchair. ""It was really hard because it felt like we were leaving part of us in Gaza,"" she says. All she could do was keep looking at the sky. And listening. It was the same sky but here in Egypt all the dread was gone, and they'd left behind the possibility of sudden and brutal death. ""When we went to the other side… I couldn't hear drones anymore. And I knew I wouldn't be hearing bombing anymore or airstrikes."" It was late at night and Tala remembers being amazed by the electric light. Back in Rafah there was no power supply to light their house. They had tried to get into Egypt three times before.We first spoke with Tala in November, when the Israeli offensive was only a few weeks old, but the death toll was already in the thousands and desperate crowds were gathered at the border. ""We're trying to survive,"" Tala said then. ""We're not sure we're going to make it, but I simply don't want to die aged 24."" Tala's mother was the only foreign passport holder - she is a Jordanian citizen and could have crossed. But the authorities would not allow her children to go with her. So the entire family stayed in Rafah. But last week the border guards relented and allowed them to enter Egypt. ""It felt really surreal that I was safe,"" Tala says. Tala is articulate and thoughtful. She was awarded a grant to study in America and lived for a year in Colorado ""with an amazing American host family."" She also won a scholarship under the state department's Tomorrow's Leaders programme, and holds an honours degree in Business Studies from the American University in Beirut. Back in Gaza she had been contemplating career possibilities when Hamas launched its attack on Israel on 7 October. Her Instagram account tracks the progress of a life upended by war - from the photo of a smiling young woman sitting outside a Beirut café captioned ""when you let the light in, shattered glass will glitter"", to the image of the home now left behind in Rafah and the caption ""we bleed the same stories no matter how far we are from you Gaza. We leave you, but you never leave us."" After each rejection at the Egypt border, Tala took Yazeed home, knowing that supplies of the medicine he needs to suppress his seizures were running lower. The war has exacerbated an already difficult situation for disabled people in Gaza, where an estimated 21% of households have at least one member living with a disability. That amounts to approximately 58,000 people according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics run by the Palestinian Authority, the Palestinians' governing body based in the occupied West Bank There was no running water and food was getting harder to find as the Israel Defense Forces advanced and tens of thousands of frightened refugees crammed into Rafah from further north in the Gaza Strip. In December, as the Gaza death toll passed 20,000, Tala told the BBC of her relief at surviving each airstrike in the area. ""Every time I hear a rocket or bomb that's going to drop on people… it's horrible to say this, but it sort of it gives me this relief that it's not us."" The air strikes could not be explained to Yazeed. They were something he experienced as a malign, elemental force. Tala explains: ""He would have a seizure every time he heard bombing. And it got really scary like his body and his mind is not able to understand everything that's going on, and then having to deal with the seizures without even medication. I think it was really heart-breaking for all of us."" Now she lives in a bustling city where food and medicine are close at hand. But Tala cannot stop thinking of the people left behind in Gaza. ""I don't think I've felt this guilty before,"" she says. ""I think this is one of the hardest feelings to talk about. I think every time I see a plane or hear a plane, and I know I'm going to be safe after hearing it, I feel guilty. ""Every time I have food to eat, or I don't have to go running for water or oil, knowing that everything is available it makes me feel guilty. I think about everyone in Gaza, the 1.2 million people who are displaced and who right now are not even sure where to go if the military invasion happens in Rafah."" In the sitting room of their rented apartment in Cairo, the rest of her family is watching the news from Gaza on television. But Yazeed looks like a different young man. The acute strain is gone from his face. After months wondering if they would survive, the family must now plan for the immediate future. ""Back then it was not about future plans or anything, it was 'we want to stay alive? How are we going to do it?'"" For now, the imperative is to find a doctor for Yazeed and education for Tala's younger sister. Tala is determined that she will go back to Gaza. ""I don't know how long it's going to take. But I definitely want to go back, and I want to rebuild. I'm not sure if it's going to be the same, but I guess with the history that each one of us has, going through what we never wanted and surviving it, I think we'd be able to rebuild it with all that strength."" Tala goes to the window and looks out at the blue of the Cairo sky. It is a sky without menace, but she can never forget that it is not the sky of home.

Gaza doctors: ‘We leave patients to scream for hours and hours’Published18 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Doctors across Gaza have described operating on patients without anaesthetic, turning people with chronic conditions away, and treating rotting wounds with limited medical supplies. ""Because of the shortage of painkillers we leave patients to scream for hours and hours,"" one told the BBC. The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the state of healthcare in Gaza as being ""beyond words"". It said 23 hospitals in Gaza were not functioning at all as of Sunday - 12 were partially functioning and one minimally. The health agency said air strikes and a lack of supplies have ""depleted an already under-resourced system"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says Hamas ""systematically uses hospitals and medical centres for its terror activities"". In a statement to the BBC, it said the IDF ""did not 'attack' hospitals, but rather entered specific areas… [to] neutralise Hamas' infrastructure and equipment, and apprehend Hamas terrorists, while acting with great caution"". It said it was allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza, including medical supplies. Aid organisations, including the WHO, say there have been ""repeated access restrictions and denials"". Warning: This article contains details some readers may find upsetting Many of Gaza's hospitals are overcrowded and have limited equipment, healthcare workers say. There are reports that some hospitals in southern Gaza are operating at over 300% of their bed capacity. Four field hospitals have been set up in Gaza, with 305 beds combined, according to the WHO. On Sunday, it said the Nasser hospital in southern Gaza wasthe latest facility to become non-operational, following a raid by Israeli forces. The IDF said on Sunday night it had found weapons at the hospital, as well as medicines with the names and photos of hostages on them, and had apprehended ""hundreds of terrorists"" hiding there. ""Hamas continues to put Gaza's most vulnerable citizens in serious danger by cynically using hospitals for terror,"" it earlier told the BBC. Staff at nearby hospitals say the operation at Nasser has put extra strain on them. Yousef al-Akkad, director of the Gaza European Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, described the current situation there as the ""worst we've faced since the beginning of the war"". ""This situation was severe before, so what do you think it's like after receiving thousands more who've been displaced and are now staying in the hallways and the public areas?"" He said the hospital did not have enough beds for the patients needing treatment, so staff were laying sheets over metal frames and wood, and putting ""a lot of patients on the floor with nothing at all"". Other doctors from across the Gaza Strip described similar situations. ""Even if there is somebody with cardiac arrest or cardiac problems, we put them on the floor and start to work on them,"" said Dr Marwan al-Hams, director of Rafah's Martyr Mohammed Yusuf al-Najjar Hospital. A Hamas political committee appoints directors of public hospitals in Gaza. In some cases, these directors were in place before Hamas took control of the Strip. Doctors say they are struggling to work with limited medical supplies. ""We cannot find a drop of oxygen,"" one told the BBC. ""We're missing anaesthetics, supplies for the ICU, antibiotics and lastly painkillers,"" said Dr al-Akkad. ""There are a lot of people who were severely burnt… we don't have any suitable painkillers for them."" One doctor confirmed that operations were going ahead without anaesthetic. A WHO team said they recently met a seven-year-old girl at the European Gaza hospital who was suffering from 75% burns, but unable to receive pain relief because of short supplies. Dr Mohamed Salha, acting director of northern Gaza's Al-Awda hospital, said people had been transported for treatment there on donkeys and horses. ""The catastrophe is when the patients' wounds are rotting, as the wounds have been open for more than two or three weeks,"" he said. He said doctors there had performed surgeries by the light of headtorches because of electricity shortages. The WHO says there are around 20,000 healthcare workers in Gaza, but that most are not working ""as they are struggling to survive and care for their families"". Dr al-Akkad said the numbers of staff and volunteers at his hospital had grown, partly because of people displaced from other areas coming to help. But he said it was not enough to cope with the volume of patients and types of injuries they were receiving. Following bombings, he said injured people come to the hospital ""looking like kofta"" - a dish with ground meat. ""The same person comes with brain injuries, broken ribs, broken limbs, and sometimes losing an eye… every injury you can imagine, you can see it in our hospital."" He said one patient could need five or more specialist doctors to deal with the range of injuries. Some of the doctors who have continued working are separated from their families. ""My family has been away from me for more than three months and I long to embrace them,"" said Dr Salha in northern Gaza, whose family have sought safety in the south. ""My consolation is that I am here serving children, women and the elderly in receiving health care and saving their lives."" Doctors told the BBC that people in Gaza with chronic conditions had ""paid a big price"". ""Frankly we don't have any beds for them or any potential to follow up with them,"" said Dr al-Akkad. ""For anybody who does dialysis four times a week, now he does it once a week. If this guy was doing 16 hours a week, it will be one hour now."" Some women are giving birth in tents with no medical support, while hospitals that provide midwifery services say they have limited capacity. ""In one department a person dies and in the other department a new life is born. Children are born and there is no milk for them. The hospital provides one box of milk for every child,"" Dr Salha said. People are coming to hospitals with diseases that have spread in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. ""There are sicknesses and we can not find any cure,"" said 54-year-old Abu Khalil, who has been displaced to Rafah in southern Gaza. ""We need to go out from dawn and get in a queue and maybe you will find 100 people in front of you. You go back empty handed."" Additional reporting by Muath Al Khatib",2024-02-18T17:02:01.000Z

Sir Keir Starmer calls for Gaza 'ceasefire that lasts'Published18 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said a ""ceasefire that lasts"" must ""happen now"" in the Israel-Gaza conflict. He was speaking at a Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow, a day after it passed a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. On Wednesday, there will be a SNP-led vote in the Commons on an immediate ceasefire, three months after 56 Labour MPs backed a previous SNP motion. The situation puts Sir Keir under fresh pressure over his stance on the crisis. Speaking to delegates on Sunday, Sir Keir said everyone wanted an end to the fighting, ""not just for now, not just for a pause, but permanently"". ""A ceasefire that lasts. This is what must happen now. The fighting must stop now."" But the Labour leader stopped short of using the word ""immediate"" which is what the SNP is calling for in terms of a ceasefire announcement. Earlier, David Lammy said Labour would be scrutinising the SNP motion ahead of the vote, but he said that any proposal must include a permanent solution to stop the conflict. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said he was not convinced the proposed wording posted online gave details of a ""sustainable"" ceasefire - but said he had not seen the full motion. He also warned parliamentary votes in the UK ""will not bring about a ceasefire"". Mr Lammy said an agreement would need to come from Hamas, the Israeli government and ""partners for peace saying the fighting must now stop"". On Saturday, Anas Sarwar - the leader of the party in Scotland - described the SNP motion as ""perfectly reasonable"", after Scottish Labour had voted at its conference in favour of backing an ""immediate"" ceasefire. But the UK Labour Party stance has consistently been that any ceasefire must be sustainable - and that was why there was a clear split in the party in the vote in November. Of the 56 Labour MPs who voted with the SNP motion then, 10 were frontbencherswho left their shadow ministerial positions as a result of taking a position at odds with the party leadership. The Gaza conflict was debated during the second day of the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow. The ceasefire motion was passed unopposed by delegates. It urges an end to rocket fire into and out of Gaza, the unconditional release of hostages taken by Hamas, the restoration of essential supplies and a pathway to peace. The SNP's Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, has written an open letter to MPs to back his party's opposition day motion calling ""for an immediate ceasefire"" in Gaza. ""It's essential that the UK changes course now and backs an immediate ceasefire without further delay,"" he said. If passed, the motion is not binding on the government. Instead, they typically express opposition MPs' position on a particular issue. Mr Sarwar said there was no ""distance"" between Scottish Labour's position and Sir Keir - despite the Labour leader failing to use the term ""immediate ceasefire"" in his speech. Speaking to the BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, Mr Sarwar said: ""The entire UK Labour Party want to see the violence stop right now, we want to see a ceasefire."" Mr Sarwar said Labour had been in touch with the SNP's whips about the wording of the ceasefire motion that will be voted on this Wednesday. However, the SNP's chief whip, Owen Thompson, denied there had been any contact. If there is a split in opinion in the party, then Labour's two Scottish MPs - Michael Shanks and Ian Murray - will have to decide whether to follow the views expressed in the Scottish Labour motion and therefore side with the SNP. Both MPs abstained in the November vote.",2024-02-18T16:30:28.000Z

West Bank Palestinians paying the price for Gaza warPublished18 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Kamal Karaja used to earn $3,500 (£2,780; €3,250) a month working on construction sites in Israel - a good living for a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank. But after the Hamas assault on Israel on 7 October, and the retaliatory Israeli air strikes and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, his permit was cancelled. Israel cited ""security concerns"". ""I waited for the war to end but it's still ongoing,"" says the 32-year-old, from the town of Deir Bzi, just outside Ramallah. ""I had to sell my car after a month due to money problems."" The Palestinian Authority (PA) says 200,000 workers are affected, mostly in the West Bank. Kamal says his three-year-old daughter Zeina ""notices that I'm not buying as much food and vegetables for the house as before"". ""She asks me why I no longer buy her chocolate and crisps."" Hundreds of men in Kamal's town are sitting at home for the same reason - and the economy has ground to a halt. After months of job-seeking, Kamal got two weeks' work on a construction site in the West Bank. But his employer had to lay him off due to the worsening financial situation. He has now started cutting down trees and selling firewood to local residents. ""Selling firewood is worth 2% of the salary I used to get from working in Israel,"" says Kamal. He did not receive any compensation from the authorities or his employer when his permit was cancelled. Like many other Palestinian workers, he was employed without a contract. Palestinians working in Israel - and those working in Israeli settlements in the West Bank - accounted for nearly one in five of all Palestinian workers before 7 October, according to official Palestinian figures. Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The workers contributed $3.2bn annually to the Palestinian economy, with most employed in construction. While some Israeli business groups lobbied for Palestinian workers to be allowed back, the government has come up with a different plan. It wants to replace Palestinian workers and plans to admit more than 60,000 workers from India, China, Moldova, Sri Lanka and Thailand this year. The head of the Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions, Shaher Saad, has criticised Israel's decision. ""There were about 105,000 Palestinians working in construction in Israel,"" Mr Saad told BBC Arabic, adding that they were all unemployed now. ""The agreements between Palestinian and Israeli unions force employers to pay compensation to workers due to the cessation of work. ""But the Israeli employers evade paying their dues and there is no law in Israel that forces them to do so."" Mr Saad added that it would be ""unrealistic and difficult"" to replace the expertise of Palestinian workers in the construction, agriculture, tourism and service sectors. Bassam Karaja (no relation), a Palestinian father-of-four from Ramallah, has also found himself forced into poverty after his work permit was cancelled. He can no longer afford to pay his bills, so his electricity and water have been cut off. ""I was never late in paying the electricity and water company while I was working in Israel these past 10 years,"" says Bassam. ""But when I stopped working, they stopped their service."" Bassam used to earn $4,000 per month while working in Israel. He says the past four months have been the worst since the Covid pandemic, where he was at least able to work part-time. Bassam accuses the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, of neglecting workers, and says they could have provided financial aid or at least stopped the utility firms withdrawing their services. Since the start of the war, the unemployment rate in the Palestinian territories has jumped from 23% to 47%. The Palestinian economy has also contracted by 35%, according to Labour Minister Nasri Abu Jeish. Mr Jeish said the PA had asked donor countries and the International Labour Organisation for help but ""they haven't heard back yet"". The Palestinian Authority was already suffering financially before the war, but now it is even worse. Israel collects tax revenues on behalf of the PA, worth about $188m per month. This money is used by the PA to pay civil servant salaries and fund public services in both Gaza and the West Bank. As a sign of the growing crisis, the PA only paid staff their December salary a few days ago, at a reduced rate of 60%. It's estimated that the PA spends about 30% of its budget in Gaza, even though Hamas has run the territory since 2007. Israel said in November that it would not allow any money to go to Hamas in Gaza, stripping this funding out. The PA refused to receive the reduced tax revenues from Israel, forcing it to cut salaries. There seems to be no end in sight. ""We thank God that we are still able to provide food and water to our families,"" says Kamal. ""The butcher understands my situation because he's a relative - but I can only last another month.""",2024-02-18T02:08:13.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: Latest ceasefire talks not very promising - QatarPublished17 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Talks to agree a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza were ""not very promising"" in recent days, mediator Qatar has said. Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he remained optimistic, but added ""time is not in our favour"". It comes as Israel's prime minister said he would press ahead with plans for a Rafah ground invasion, despite growing international pressure. Hamas has blamed Israel for a lack of progress in achieving a ceasefire deal. Talks have been taking place in Cairo as senior officials from the US, Israel, Egypt and Qatar meet to try to broker a pause in fighting. ""The pattern in the last few days [is] not really very promising but, as I always repeat, we will always remain optimistic and will always remain pushing,"" said Sheik Mohammed, speaking at a meeting of world leaders at the Munich Security Conference. ""I believe in this agreement we are talking at a bigger scale and we still see some difficulties on the humanitarian part of these negotiations,"" he added. But he said a truce should not be dependent on a deal to release the hostages held by Hamas. ""This is the dilemma that we've been in and unfortunately that's been misused by a lot of countries - that in order to get a ceasefire, it's conditional to have the hostage deal,"" he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he sent negotiators following a request from US President Joe Biden, but added they did not return for further discussions because Hamas's demands were ""delusional"". The group has laid out a series of demands, including the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, full withdrawal of Israel's forces and an end to the war after a135-day pause in fighting, broken into three phases. Israel launched its military offensive after Hamas-led gunmen killed at least 1,200 people and seized 253 hostages in a surprise attack on its territory on 7 October. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 28,800 people, mainly women and children - have been killed in Israel's campaign. Speaking in Jerusalem on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu reiterated his aims of destroying Hamas and said his forces would fight until Israel achieved ""total victory"". He said those urging against military action in Rafah, the southern-most Gazan city where some 1.5 million people have fled, were effectively telling the country to ""lose the war"", adding that his troops would enter even if a hostage deal was reached. In the earlier days of the war, Israel had instructed Palestinians to seek refuge in Rafah as the Israeli military moved against the northern cities. Israeli authorities this week said they wanted civilians to relocate to what they call a ""humanitarian zone"" - a thin strip of mainly agricultural land along the Mediterranean coast known as al-Mawasi. President Biden has urged Israel not to launch an offensive in Rafah without a plan to keep civilians safe. Mr Netanyahu is also facing pressure domestically to bring home the hostages who remain in Gaza. Thousands of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday calling for early elections, which are not scheduled until 2026. Israel's prime minister dismissed similar calls from within his own ruling Likud party for an election immediately after the conflict with Gaza had ended, saying it would ""immediately divide us"". Meanwhile, Hamas has blamed Israel for a lack of progress in achieving a ceasefire deal and threatened to suspend its involvement unless relief supplies are brought into the north of Gaza. Aid agencies say they are increasingly concerned about the lack of food, water and medicine in the territory.",2024-02-17T22:18:29.000Z

Tens of thousands at pro-Palestinian march in LondonPublished17 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Tens of thousands of people have taken part in a pro-Palestinian march in central London. The Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) march was calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war. Saturday's march was the first protest to go near the Israeli embassy in west London since a static rally in October. Some 1,500 officers were deployed to police the protest. Demonstrators said it was one of busiest marches they have attended so far. Five people were arrested in one incident, on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker, and police said there were seven other arrests. One person was arrested on suspicion of supporting a proscribed organisation, one arrested for obstruction, two arrested on suspicion of refusing to remove a face covering when requested, and a further three for using abusive or threatening words or behaviour or displaying material abusive or likely to stir up racial hatred. BBC News saw tens of thousands of people at the start of the march at Marble Arch. PSC criticised the government and Labour for refusing to call for an immediate ceasefire. The campaign group's Ben Jamal said there was ""mounting pressure from world leaders"" on Israel. ""The moral imperative is clear. An immediate ceasefire is a simple, absolute necessity,"" he said. It was the first demonstration in the area of the Israeli embassy since aprotest was held two days afterthe 7 October attacks on Israel by Hamas, a group designated as a terror organisation by the UK government. Police restricted the start time of the march to ensure an event taking place at a synagogue would finish prior to the protest passing by the building. The march set off along Park Lane around 13:30 GMT, and made its way along Knightsbridge and Kensington Road to near the Israeli embassy in Kensington, where speeches were taking place. Addressing the crowd, the Palestinians' top envoy to the UK, Husam Zomlot, said: ""Hang on to your anger, hang on to your enragement, hang on to your horror and use it, use it in the pursuit of justice."" Protesters had been told by police the march must stop by 17:00 and that demonstrators had to leave by 18:00. Cdr Kyle Gordon appealed for marchers to stay within the law, after the force dealt with a number of offences involving placards and hate speech at previous protests. The protest faced criticism from Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy, who accused the march of being ""another antisemitic hate parade through London"". Protests have also taken place in Sydney and Istanbul. Israel launched its military offensive after waves of Hamas fighters burst through Israel's border on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 28,600 people, mainly women and children - have been killed in Israel's campaign. Israel says its aim is to destroy Hamas and secure the return of the hostages. Israel is being urged not to send ground forces into Rafah in southern Gaza and on the Egyptian border, where many Palestinians are living after areas closer to their homes were affected by fighting. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called for a pause to fighting to get aid in and hostages, and a ""sustainable ceasefire"". Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has said the government supports a ""move from a pause - to get aid in and hostages out - towards a sustainable ceasefire, leading to a long term political solution, including a Palestinian state"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told BBC News on Saturday ""we all want to get to a ceasefire"" in Gaza, but stopped short of calling for an ""immediate"" ceasefire. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Sir Keir said: ""We do need to get to a ceasefire, we all want to get to a ceasefire. The question is how do we get there? The fighting has to stop. Any assault on Rafah must be repelled, we must not allow that to go ahead"". But Scottish Labour haspassed a motion calling for an immediate ceasefirein Gaza.",2024-02-17T20:02:10.000Z

Israel Gaza war: Satellite images show construction on Egypt's borderPublished16 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Satellite images appear to show extensive construction work in progress along Egypt's border with Gaza, which reports claim is being carried out in preparation for housing Palestinian refugees. Unnamed Egyptian sources reportedly said the work is being done in order to set up an isolated buffer zone containing a walled enclosure in Egypt's North Sinai province in case Israel goes ahead with its planned ground offensive in Gaza's southernmost city, Rafah. According to a report published by a human rights group, seven-metre-high walls are being constructed in the zone. Egypt has publicly denied making any such preparations. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant also said Israel ""has no intention of evacuating Palestinian civilians to Egypt"". Since the start of the Gaza war following Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October, Egypt has consistently said it would not open its border to refugees. It has taken that stance partly because it does not want to appear complicit in the large-scale displacement of Palestinians, but also out of economic and security concerns. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears set on a major offensive in Rafah - where some 1.4 million people are sheltering - despite a chorus of international warnings. Israel claims Hamas forces are in the city and must be ""eliminated"". It also believes Israeli hostages - of which 130 are still unaccounted for - are being held there. Ahead of the planned assault on Rafah, Israel is directing civilians to move to open ground north of the city. Mr Netanyahu has spoken vaguely of ""areas that we've cleared north of Rafah"", but indications suggest planning is still at an early stage. Israel had earlier instructed Palestinians to head to Rafah while fighting went on in the north of the strip at the start of its offensive. ""We will fight until complete victory and this includes a powerful action also in Rafah after we allow the civilian population to leave the battle zones,"" Mr Netanyahu said on Thursday. The latest satellite imagery, released by Maxar Technologies, may suggest that Egypt has decided to take precautionary measures as a result of the impending offensive. In one image, dated 15 February, large areas of land close to the Rafah crossing into Gaza appear to have been cleared. The work appears to have been completed in the last few days, as can be seen when comparing the landscape with an earlier image of the same area from five days ago. Speaking to Saudi news network Al Arabiya Al Hadath TV on Thursday, the governor of Egypt's North Sinai province, Mohammed Shousha, said the purpose of the activity in the area was ""to conduct an inventory of the houses"" destroyed during Egypt's past campaign against Islamic State group in the area. Mr Shousha added that Egypt's position is ""not to allow the forced displacement of Gaza residents into Egypt"". But satellite imagery from 15 February also shows construction vehicles dotted along the road next to the cleared border area, with some of them appearing to be erecting a large wall. In the below close up, a vehicle can be seen next to wall panels which appear to be laid on the ground ready to be added to the wall. In addition to the satellite images, photos and videos of the area captured and published by members of the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights also appear to show construction work taking place. The group said in a report earlier this weekthat the footage - which has not been verified by the BBC - shows an enclosure featuring seven-metre-high walls being constructed in the area. The report also quoted a source with knowledge of the matter saying that construction is being carried out with the aim of ""receiving refugees from Gaza in the event of a mass exodus of residents of the Strip"". The Wall Street Journal confirmed the reportwith Egyptian officials and security analysts, stating that the enclosure being constructed is 8 sq miles (20.7 sq km) and could accommodate more than 100,000 people. Speaking to foreign reporters on Thursday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was emphatic about the matter: ""The State of Israel has no intention of evacuating Palestinian civilians to Egypt. ""We respect and value our peace agreement with Egypt, which is a cornerstone of stability in the region as well as an important partner."" Israel knows that it cannot afford to be seen to be driving Palestinians out of their land, but that does not mean it will prevent people from leaving if they want to. Israel would not stand in the way if Egypt was willing to take some 100,000 refugees (as some estimates of the capacity of the enclosure being built in Egypt's Sinai suggest). UN officials are deeply apprehensive, fearing that a mass evacuation may be looming. ""It looks like it's heading that way,"" one official told the BBC on condition of anonymity. Speaking to Reuters news agency at the Munich Security Conference, the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi warned that a spill-over of refugees from Rafah into Egypt would be ""a disaster for the Palestinians... a disaster for Egypt and a disaster for the future of peace"". Expulsion into Egypt - which is how any evacuation across the border will feel - touches on the deepest Palestinian fears. Around 80% of the Gaza Strip's population are descended from refugees who fled or were driven from their villages during Israel's War of Independence. To leave Gaza, the last fragment of their ancestral home, would feel to many like a repeat of what Palestinians call the ""Naqba"", or catastrophe of 1948. Even if a refugee camp just across the border is described as a temporary shelter, the sense of shock that would accompany their departure from Gaza is likely to be profound. And while Israel might want to portray this as a voluntary move - a response to an Egyptian invitation - Palestinians would struggle to see it as anything other than another forced expulsion, after more than four months of Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip. The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory reports that at least 28,775 people, mostly women and children, have been killed as a result of Israel's offensive in Gaza. Israel took action after Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and seized 253 hostages in a surprise attack on its territory on 7 October.",2024-02-16T18:23:58.000Z

Gaza's Nasser hospital: Fears for patients as Israeli raid continuesPublished16 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israeli military says its special forces are still inside the Nasser hospital in Gaza as fears grow for patients at the site. Israel launched what it described as a ""precise and limited mission"" there on Thursday. The military says it has caught ""dozens of terror suspects"". Hamas dismissed that claim as ""lies"". The Hamas-run health ministry said five people died after generators failed. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the facility urgently needed fuel. It said the fuel was vital to ""ensure the continuation of the provision of life-saving services"". Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson, said there were now reports that the orthopaedic unit at the hospital, in the city of Khan Younis, had been damaged. ""That obviously reduces the ability to provide the urgent medical care,"" he said, adding there were still ""critically injured and sick patients"" at the hospital. ""More degradation to the hospital means more lives being lost."" Nasser is the main hospital in southern Gaza, and is one of the few still functioning. It has been the scene of intense fighting between the IDF and Hamas for days. An injured man who had to leave the hospital said the conditions there were dire. ""Since they besieged it, there is no water or food,"" Raed Abed told the Associated Press. ""Garbage is widespread, and sewage has flooded the emergency department."" The hospital's director, Nahed Abu-Teima, told BBC Arabic the situation inside was ""catastrophic and very dangerous"". The Hamas-run health ministry reported on Friday that the five people who died at the hospital did so after the electricity generators went down and oxygen could not be provided. The deaths have not been independently verified. On Wednesday, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) ordered thousands of displaced people who had been sheltering there to leave. Images, verified by the BBC, showed medical staff rushing patients on stretchers through a corridor filled with smoke or dust. The IDF believes Hamas has been using hospitals and other civilian bases as shields for military activities. ""We can't give them [Hamas] a free pass, we have to make sure that they are pursued and hunted down,"" IDF spokesperson Lt Col Peter Lerner told the BBC. He said the military had been making ""a huge effort to evacuate people from the hospital in order to get them out of harm's way"", denying claims that civilians had been targeted. The IDF said that among those it had captured at the hospital were 20 Hamas members who were part of the 7 October attacks on Israel. It also said it had found weapons, including grenades, at the facility. The military is also searching for the bodies of Israeli hostages which it said intelligence suggests might be hidden in the hospital. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israeli tanks were targeting the nearby Al-Amal hospital, ""resulting in very severe damage in two nursing rooms"". They wrote on social media that nobody had been hurt. Intense hostilities have been reported around the hospital recently. The PRCS said it was raided last week after some 8,000 displaced people and patients complied with an order to evacuate. On Friday, they said that two doctors who were arrested during the raid had been released, while 12 other staff remained in custody. Israel launched its military offensive after waves of Hamas fighters burst through Israel's border on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and taking 253 others back to Gaza as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 28,700 people, mainly women and children - have been killed in Israel's campaign. Israel is facing increasing international pressure to show restraint but efforts to negotiate an end to the fighting have not yet yielded any results. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the ceasefire talks told the BBC that the gap between the negotiating parties was still wide and there were disagreements over many of the proposed provisions. Senior officials from the US, Israel, Egypt and Qatar have been meeting in Cairo this week to try and hammer out a deal. The official said that the main issue remains the disagreement with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over what happens the day after the war is over. The US want to rely on a strengthened Palestinian Authority, while Israel is against having a single administration in charge of the West Bank and Gaza. Another disagreement is over Israel's aim of completely destroying Hamas, which the US thinks will be difficult to achieve anytime soon. The US is said to be trying to pressure the two sides to reach a long period of calm to make it difficult for the two sides to return to fighting again.",2024-02-16T17:38:32.000Z

Nasser hospital in 'catastrophic' condition as Israeli troops raidPublished15 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel's military claims it has captured ""dozens"" of terror suspects during a raid on southern Gaza's main hospital, as staff and patients were forced to flee under gunfire. Israel said it  launched a ""precise and limited mission"" at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, adding it had intelligence that Hamas had held hostages there. Hamas dismissed the claim as ""lies"". The hospital's director told the BBC that conditions inside were ""catastrophic and very dangerous"". The Israel Defense Forces' chief spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said among those captured was a participant in Hamas's attack inside Israel on 7 October, ""an ambulance driver for Hamas"" who had driven a hostage into Gaza, and a member of the armed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine group. He said that interrogations of ""terrorists who were arrested or surrendered in the area"" and the testimonies of freed hostages, had ""determined that kidnapped Israelis were previously held in the hospital compound"". However, he said Israeli special forces involved in the hospital raid had yet to find any evidence of kidnapped Israelis and that the search was continuing. His comments came hours after images, verified by the BBC, showed medical staff rushing patients on stretchers through a corridor filled with smoke or dust. One patient - who is still in their bed - can be seen being moved through a corridor where the ceiling is damaged. Other patients can also be seen, including one person being carried away in what looks like a blanket. In another clip, people can be seen placing furniture and other items against a door as a narrator states in English that Israeli forces are about to enter. A nurse inside the hospital told the BBC that a ""large number of dogs"" had been released inside the hospital during the operation. Nahed Abu-Teima the director of Nasser, told BBC Arabic that there had been ""violent shelling and severe explosions"" for several hours ""in the vicinity of the complex"". He said the patients who had remained at the facility were ""piled up in wards"" with critical injuries and appealed to the UN and Red Cross to ""save"" them and the staff. Nasser is one of the few hospitals still functioning in Gaza, and has been the scene of intense fighting between the IDF and Hamas for days. Thursday's operation came a day after the IDF ordered thousands of displaced people who had been sheltering at the site to leave. Israel's military said it had assured Nasser hospital staff that patients and staff were not obliged to leave, and that medics could continue treating Gazan patients. Dr Ashraf al-Quadra, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, denied that was the case, saying Israeli troops had forced the hospital management to ""keep intensive care patients without medical equipment"". A pharmacist who works in the hospital, Rawan Al-Mughrabi, was among those evacuated by Israeli forces on Wednesday. She told BBC Arabic there was ""a state of panic that made people [being evacuated] stand on top of each other and scream. Many people were harmed, and others returned to the hospital. ""As soon as we left the hospital gate and reached the checkpoints, the entire hospital and departments were stormed by police dogs, and while we were standing at the checkpoints, many people were arrested. ""Most of the medical cases were evacuated from the hospital, and only the very critical cases remained,"" she said. On Wednesday, the UN's humanitarian office said there were allegations of sniper fire at the complex, putting the lives of doctors, patients and displaced people at risk. The medical charity Medicins San Frontieres said those ordered to evacuate faced an impossible choice - to stay ""and become a potential target"" or leave ""into an apocalyptic landscape"" of bombings. Israel launched its military offensive after waves of Hamas fighters burst through Israel's border on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and taking 253 others back to Gaza as hostages.

Israel says its aim is to destroy Hamas and secure the return of the hostages. Israel is facing increasing international pressure to show restraint. On Wednesday France's President Emmanuel Macron phoned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to say Israel's operations in Gaza ""must cease"" and that the human cost of the Gaza operation was ""intolerable"". But Mr Netanyahu insisted his troops will advance on the Gazan city of Rafah, which has already come under bombardment. Some 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering in the area. The prime ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand issued a joint statement expressing their ""grave concern"" that a military operation in Rafah would be ""catastrophic"".",2024-02-15T20:29:54.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: Rafah images show huge blast craters close to campsPublished15 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"New satellite images reveal large craters in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza following Israeli strikes. Some of the craters are only about 130m (426ft) away from rows of tents, where many people displaced by the war are sheltering. On 12 February, after two hostages were rescued in an Israeli raid, Rafah came under intense aerial bombardment. In the latest satellite images, taken on 14 February, several craters can be seen near the site of the operation. BBC Verifyhas analysed a videoprovided by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of the rescue and located the operation to a district of Rafah where there are many plastic greenhouses. Several of the greenhouses, as well as other nearby buildings, have been destroyed. The latest satellite images also show how close the strikes were to areas filled with temporary structures housing people who have been forced from their homes. Israel has repeatedly told Palestinians living in north and central Gaza to move south for their own safety - but fighting has now come to these very areas. The IDF say it is targeting Hamas fighters who operate there. Rafah's population is thought to have increased five-fold in the months following the 7 October Hamas attacks,with 1.5 million people now estimated to be living there. Vast spaces there have been filled with tents, including a main road. From above, you can see that a main highway through Rafah has been clogged with temporary structures and blocked off to traffic. BBC Verify has also been tracking some other areas where temporary camps have been set up, including the nearby Al-Mawasi area, where tent numbers have grown considerably over the last few weeks. Al-Mawasi is a narrow strip of land by the Mediterranean Sea near the coast in southern Gaza. Israeli officials instructed people to take shelter in the area in the first two months of the war in Gaza. Before the conflict it largely consisted of sandy dunes and agricultural land, but now temporary structures have increasingly been built along the coast. A large area in the east - once completely empty - is also now filled with tents. Graphics by Tural Ahmedzade.",2024-02-15T18:47:25.000Z

Israel Gaza: Netanyahu vows to press ahead with Rafah offensivePublished15 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted his troops will advance on the Gazan city of Rafah, defying outside pleas to reconsider. French President Emmanuel Macron was among those warning Mr Netanyahu off, telling him the human cost of Israel's operation in Gaza was ""intolerable"". But Mr Netanyahu has ordered his army to prepare for a ground assault. Some 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering in Rafah, which has already come under bombardment. Mr Netanyahu vowed to press on with a ""powerful"" assault, declaring that Hamas, the group which controls Gaza, must be eliminated from the southern city. ""We will fight until complete victory and this includes a powerful action also in Rafah after we allow the civilian population to leave the battle zones,"" he said. President Macron phoned Mr Netanyahu on Wednesday to say Israel's operations in Gaza ""must cease"". He expressed ""France's firm opposition to an Israeli offensive in Rafah, which could only lead to a humanitarian disaster of a new magnitude"". The prime ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand issued a joint statement expressing their ""grave concern"" that a military operation in Rafah would be ""catastrophic"". ""We urge the Israeli government not to go down this path,"" the statement read, adding ""the impacts on Palestinian civilians from an expanded military operation would be devastating"". German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, visiting Israel, warned that people in Rafah with nowhere to go could not ""simply vanish into thin air."" Spain and the Republic of Ireland have asked the EU, of which they are members, to examine ""urgently"" whether Israel is complying with its human rights obligations in Gaza under an accord linking rights to trade. The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory reports that at least 28,576 people, mostly women and children, have been killed as a result of Israel's offensive in Gaza. Israel took action after Hamas-led gunmen killed at least 1,200 people and seized 253 hostages in a surprise attack on its territory on 7 October. In the earlier days of the war, Israel had instructed Palestinians to seek refuge in Rafah as the Israeli military moved against the northern cities. Rafah is Gaza's southern-most and features a crossing point into Egypt where humanitarian aid has been allowed to enter the Strip. Now Israeli authorities want civilians to relocate to what they call a ""humanitarian zone"" - a thin strip of mainly agricultural land along the Mediterranean coast known as al-Mawasi. Among the displaced civilians in Rafah was Ahlam Abu Assi, who told AFP news agency she ""would rather die"" there than return to famine-like conditions like those experienced by relatives who had stayed in Gaza City. ""My son and his children have nothing to eat. They cook a handful of rice and save it for the next day,"" she said. Another city, Khan Younis, has been the focus of Israel's operations in the south of Gaza so far. Thousands of displaced Palestinians sought shelter there in the Nasser hospital butare now also being ordered to evacuate. Mr Netanyahu's vow to press on came after peace negotiations involving officials from the US, Israel, Egypt and Qatar ended inconclusively. Israel's prime ministerial office said Hamas had presented no new offer for a hostage deal and Israel would not accept the militant group's ""ludicrous demands"". ""A change in Hamas' positions will make it possible to move forward in the negotiations,"" it added.",2024-02-15T02:33:06.000Z

Israel launches deadly air strikes in Lebanon after rockets hit army basePublished14 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"At least seven civilians have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon, security sources say, after Hezbollah rocket fire killed a soldier in Israel. A woman and two children were killed in Souaneh, and at least four members of a family were later killed in Nabatieh. At least two Hezbollah fighters were also killed in attacks in southern Lebanon, the group said. Israel's military said it hit Hezbollah infrastructure in response to a deadly rocket attack on northern Israel. Hezbollah fighters have exchanged fire with Israeli forces almost every day along the border since the start of the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip in October. The clashes have raised fears of a wider regional conflict. On Wednesday morning, sirens sounded across northern Israel as barrages of rockets were fired towards the border communities of Netua and Manara, and the town of Safed, which is 14 km (9 miles) south of the frontier. One Israeli soldier was killed and seven others were wounded after their base in Safed was hit by rockets, Israeli media and emergency services said. The soldier who died was later identified as Staff-Sergeant Omer Sarah Benjo. A video showed that another rocket landed near the gate of Safed's hospital. Hezbollah later claimed it had attacked an ""enemy position"" in Safed ""in support of the people and resistance of Gaza which is being subjected to brutal Zionist aggression with a US green light"". In the afternoon, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that fighter jets had ""struck a series of Hezbollah terror targets"" in Souaneh, Aadchit, Jabal al-Braij, Kfar Houneh and Kfar Dunin in response to the rocket fire. ""Among the targets struck were military compounds, operational control rooms, and terror infrastructure,"" it said, adding that several targets belonged to Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, whose well-trained members are considered the group's special forces. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) said a strike on a home in Souaneh killed a Syrian woman, Rawaa al-Mohammed, and her two sons, Hassan Mohsen, 13, and Amir Mohsen, two. Video from the town showed residents inspecting the rubble of at least one destroyed building and the burned-out wreckage of a car. NNA also reported that one man was killed and 10 other people were injured in Aadchit. It named the dead man as Hassan Ali Najm, a Hezbollah fighter whose death the group confirmed in a statement on Telegram. Later on Wednesday, a security source told AFP four members of the same family, including two women, were killed in a subsequent strike. The source said they had no links to Hezbollah. ""As we have made clear time and time again, Israel is not interested in a war on two fronts. But if provoked, we will respond forcefully,"" Israeli government spokesperson Ilana Stein told Reuters news agency. ""The current reality, where tens of thousands of Israelis are displaced [in the north] and cannot return to their homes, is unbearable. They must be able to return home and live in peace and security."" The IDF's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, meanwhile told the heads of northern municipalities: ""There are great achievements striking Hezbollah in Lebanon, but we continue to operate - this is not the time to stop. ""We are intensifying the strikes all the time, and Hezbollah are paying an increasingly heavy price."" On Tuesday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned Israeli leaders in a speech that launching a war against the group would result in a ""million evacuees"" from northern Israel. ""To those who threaten us with a widening of the war: if you widen, we will too,"" he said, adding that ""those who think the resistance might be afraid are very mistaken"". He also vowed that Hezbollah would only cease fire ""when the aggression stops and there is a ceasefire in Gaza"".",2024-02-14T22:52:21.000Z

Tobias Ellwood says MPs are not 'fair game' after protest at homePublished14 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Conservative MP has said politicians cannot be viewed as ""fair game"" after a large-scale pro-Palestinian protest at his family home. Tobias Ellwood told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the ""bar of acceptable treatment"" of MPs was falling. More than 60 people, some holding Palestinian flags, gathered at his home on Monday to call for a Gaza ceasefire. Mr Ellwood and his family were not at their Dorset home at the time after police had warned them to ""stay away"". Speaking to Evan Davis, Mr Ellwood said: ""We were heading that way, we were advised not to go to the property.. arriving through that crowd would've antagonised the situation."" The Bournemouth East MP praised the police who he said arrived ""very, very quickly"". ""Having picked up that intelligence, they blocked my driveway, they protected my property with their vehicles, and an armed response unit was positioned around the corner,"" he added. Dorset Police said officers were deployed to Mr Ellwood's home but no arrests were made and the protesters left by 20:50 GMT. Organisers of the protest said it was ""entirely legal"" and in response to the Israeli bombing of Rafah in southern Gaza, which was ""the place of shelter for more than 1.6 million refugees"". They said they wanted Mr Ellwood to call for ""an immediate and unconditional ceasefire"" in Gaza. When asked about the difference between legitimate protest and intimidation, Mr Ellwood said: ""All MPs expect criticism from time to time, it comes with the territory, but the bar of acceptable treatment is falling. ""Advertising the private address, to mobilise an aggressive, intimidating rally at an MP's residential property, impacting not just on the family but also neighbours as well, for me is a step too far. ""This cannot be normalised in anyway... democracy clearly is not in a good place if this becomes the norm."" When it was put to Mr Ellwood that he ""was not someone who seems to have taken a stridently pro-Israel position"", the MP said it was a sign of the protesters' ""ignorance"" He said he believes ""political curiosity should be encouraged"", but insisted ""MPs cannot be fair game, to be attacked in this way"". ""We are losing the art of how to disagree as politics becomes evermore angry and hateful,"" he added. But Mr Ellwood reiterated that he ""will not be deterred by this attempt to intimidate me"", saying it ""motivates him further"" to stand up for what he believes in. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak appeared to reference the protest when hewrote on X: ""Democracy is built on free debate - but increasingly MPs have been targeted by aggressive mobs for exercising those freedoms. We will never let those who intimidate prevail. ""It's paramount MPs' security is protected, and our democratic values upheld. Nothing is more important."" Israel declared war on Hamas after the group led an attack on communities inside Israel, killing around 1,200 people. Since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, more than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed and 68,000 injured as Israel launched missiles and ground operations into the Gaza Strip in response.

Israel orders evacuation of largest hospital in southern GazaPublished14 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Palestinians say Israeli forces have ordered thousands of displaced people to evacuate the largest hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip. Videos showed an announcement via loudspeaker and a crowd leaving the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis. Israel's military said it had opened a secure route for civilians, but did not intend to evacuate patients and medics. Doctors and health officials say a number of people there have been killed by Israeli sniper fire in recent days. The reported deaths came as battles between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters raged in the vicinity of the hospital, which the UN says has been under siege for around a week and is only minimally functional. Intense hostilities have also been reported around the nearby Al-Amal hospital, which the Palestinian Red Crescent said was raided last week after some 8,000 displaced people and patients complied with an order to evacuate. The Israeli military has previously accused Hamas fighters of operating from inside and around the two hospitals - a claim that the armed group and medical officials have denied. Khan Younis has been the focus of Israel's invasion of the south of Gaza, which began in early December after troops largely took control of Hamas strongholds in the north. The Israeli military launched a large-scale air and ground campaign after Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel on 7 October and took 253 other people hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 28,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, including at least 103 in the past 24 hours. On Wednesday morning, Palestinian journalist Mohammed al-Helo posted on Instagram what he said wasfootage showing a drone hovering over Nasser hospitalas a soldier using a loudspeaker says in Arabic: ""Go now out of the hospital, go now to the municipality."" About an hour later,he posted another video showing dozens of people walking through a courtyardand then turning towards al-Bahr Street, which connects western Khan Younis with the Mediterranean coast. Later, Gaza's health ministry put out a brief statement accusing Israeli troops of ""forcibly evacuating"" thousands of displaced people, medical staff and patients from Nasser hospital. Médecins Sans Frontières reported that displaced people had been ordered to leave and thatmedical staff and patients had been told that they could remain in the hospital with a limit of one caretaker per patient. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had ""opened a secure route to evacuate the civilian population taking shelter in the area of the Nasser hospital toward the humanitarian zone"" - a reference to a thin strip of mainly agricultural land along the Mediterranean coast in an area known as al-Mawasi. ""The evacuation of the civilian population is being conducted in a controlled and precise manner by IDF troops in order to prevent terrorists exploiting the evacuation,"" it added. ""We emphasize that the IDF does not intend to evacuate patients and medical staff, the troops involved have been thoroughly instructed in advance to prioritize the safety of civilians, patients, medical workers, and medical facilities during the operation."" The IDF also alleged that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries - ""cynically embeds itself within hospitals and civilian infrastructure"". Before the evacuation began, a doctor at Nasser hospital said in an audio message that Israeli tanks and snipers had surrounded the facility. Dr Khaled Alserr, a trauma surgeon, also said that he had treated a 16-year-old boy who was shot as he tried to leave the hospital. ""[When] he reached the gate of the hospital he was shot by four bullets by an Israeli sniper,"" he added. The Gaza health ministry also said Israeli sniper fire killed three people and injured two others at the hospital on Tuesday. Another seven people were reportedly shot dead in the courtyard on Monday. There was no immediate response to the allegations from the IDF, although it insists that its forces do not intentionally target civilians. A doctor at Nasser hospital's emergency department, Haitham Ahmed, told BBC Arabic on Tuesday night that Israeli tanks had destroyed the northern wall during heavy bombardment and violent clashes in the surrounding area. ""Part of the stock of medical supplies... was burned as a result of the morning clashes,"" he said. ""Since [Monday], with the hospital's infrastructure being affected, sewage has unfortunately begun to flow into the departments located on the ground floors of the hospital, and there is a fear that it will reach the emergency and radiology departments."" The director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that he was alarmed by what was reportedly happening. ""Nasser is the backbone of the health system in southern Gaza. It must be protected,"" he warned. ""Humanitarian access must be allowed."" ""Hospitals must be safeguarded so that they can serve their life-saving function. They must not be militarized or attacked."" Only 11 of Gaza's 33 hospitals are currently partially functioning, according to the UN. As well as being overwhelmed by huge numbers of casualties, the hospitals are serving as shelters for thousands among the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes as a result of the fighting. The majority of those displaced are now living in Rafah, south of Khan Younis, where there is mounting concern about the lack of food, water and sanitation. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to carry out a ""powerful"" operation in Rafah after civilians were evacuated. He reiterated that Israel would fight on until ""total victory"". Meanwhile, the UN's humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, told the BBC that there was only 24 hours' worth of food left in the city. He also warned that it be impossible to run any effective humanitarian operations or protect civilians if Israel sent ground forces into Rafah. ""I understand why the Israelis want to move in on Rafah. I understand their desire to recover those hostages, those poor people,"" he said. ""What I want to say to you, before it starts is, if there is an assault you cannot, you must not, you should not, rely on the fantasy of a humanitarian operation being able to save people in the middle of such carnage."" In a separate development, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas - who is based in the occupied West Bank - urged Hamas to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza quickly to avoid ""another catastrophic event"". Negotiations are underway in Cairo aimed at securing a new temporary ceasefire deal, including the release of more Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.",2024-02-14T19:04:43.000Z

Israel Gaza: UN warns of 'slaughter' if Israel launches ground assault on RafahPublished14 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A top UN official has warned an Israeli assault on Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, could lead to a ""slaughter"". Humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said Palestinians in Gaza were already suffering an ""assault that is unparalleled in its intensity, brutality and scope"". The consequences of an invasion of Rafah would be ""catastrophic"", he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to defeat Hamas gunmen he says are hiding in the city. In an unusually strongly worded statement, Mr Griffiths said over a million people were ""crammed in Rafah, staring death in the face"". He said civilians in the city had little food or access to medicine and ""nowhere safe to go"". An Israeli invasion of the city, he added, would ""leave an already fragile humanitarian operation at death's door"". A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the BBC's Newshour programme the UN had not received any Rafah evacuation plans from Israel and would not participate in any forced evacuation. Stephane Dujarric said: ""The United Nations will not be party to any forced displacement of people."" Rafah is a small city in the south of the Gaza Strip on the border with Egypt. Before the war it was home to around 250,000 people, but since Israel ordered civilians to evacuate south its population has swelled to an estimated 1.5 million. Many are living in tents in desperate conditions and say they have nowhere to go. Rafah has come under heavy Israeli air strikes in recent days, with at least 67 people killed there on Monday according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Mr Griffiths also said humanitarian workers working in Gaza had been ""shot at, held at gunpoint, attacked and killed"" because of the breakdown in law and order. His statement came asnegotiations for a ceasefirebetween Israel and Hamas in Gaza resumed in Cairo. Senior officials from the US, Israel, Egypt and Qatar met on Tuesday, as pressure mounted on Israel from the international community not to invade Rafah. Mr Guterres said that hoped the talks would be successful so as to avoid an Israeli attack on the city. But subsequent statements following the meeting from the Egyptian State Information Service indicated there had been no breakthrough. It said the meeting ""confirmed the extreme danger of escalating operations in Rafah in southern Gaza and warned of the serious consequences of such an action"", but made no announcement of progress towards peace. US President Joe Biden haswarned Israelthat civilians must be protected. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron has told Israel to ""stop and think seriously"" before attacking Rafah. At least 1,200 people were killed during attacks in Israel by Hamas-led gunmen on 7 October last year. In response, Israel launched a military campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 28,400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed and more than 68,000 wounded since the war began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-02-14T05:39:39.000Z

France bans 28 Israeli settlers over West Bank violencePublished13 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"France will ban 28 Israeli settlers accused of attacking Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank. The foreign ministry said it ""firmly condemned"" the ""unacceptable violence"". The US and UK recently took similar action, each imposing restrictions on four Israelis. On Monday France, Poland and Germany all announced that Israelis involved in West Bank attacks would be sanctioned.  Violence there has surged since Hamas's attack in southern Israel on 7 October. ""These measures come as violence perpetrated by settlers against the Palestinian population has increased in recent months"", the French foreign ministry said in a statement. ""Colonisation is illegal under international law and must stop,"" it added. ""Its continuation is incompatible with the creation of a viable Palestinian state, which is the only solution so that Israelis and Palestinians can live, side by side, in peace and security."" The statement said France would also be seeking sanctions at European level. The individuals have not been named. On Monday,the UK announced financial and travel restrictions on four ""extremist"" Israeli settlers. The Foreign Office said they had committed human rights abuses against Palestinians in the West Bank. At the start of the month, US President Joe Bidenapproved sanctions on four Israelis. Only one individual was on both the UK and US lists. Those on the US list are blocked from accessing any property or assets in the US and cannot use the country's financial system. The White House said violence in the West Bank had reached ""intolerable levels"". As of the end of January, 370 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, 94 of them children, since the 7 October attack on Israel, according to the UN. At least eight of the Palestinians who have died were killed by Israeli settlers.",2024-02-13T19:17:50.000Z

Pro-Palestinian protests: Paraglider badge wearers found guiltyPublished13 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Three women have been found guilty of terrorism offences despite ""no evidence"" of support for Hamas. Heba Alhayek, 29, and Pauline Ankunda, 26, attached images to their backs seven days after Hamas militants used paragliders to enter Israel in October, the court heard. Noimutu Olayinka Taiwo, 27, stuck one to a placard's handle at a central London pro-Palestinian march. They denied charges under the Terrorism Act. The three were charged with carrying or displaying an article to arouse reasonable suspicion that they were supporters of a banned organisation. Convicting them at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Deputy Senior District Judge Tan Ikram said: ""Seven days earlier, Hamas went into Israel with what was described by the media as paragliders. ""A reasonable person would have seen and read that. ""I do not find a reasonable person would interpret the image merely as a symbol of freedom."" During their trial, prosecutor Brett Weaver told the court that the images displayed could have been viewed as ""celebrating the use of the paragliders' tactic"". But Mr Ikram, delivering his verdict, said: ""I want to be clear, there's no evidence that any of these defendants are supporters of Hamas, or were seeking to show support for them."" He said he had ""decided not to punish"" the defendants, and handed the trio each a 12-month conditional discharge. ""You crossed the line, but it would have been fair to say that emotions ran very high on this issue,"" Mr Ikram said. ""Your lesson has been well learned. I do not find you were seeking to show any support for Hamas."" Lawyers for the group had suggested they were actually displaying images of a parachute emoji rather than paragliders, and claimed police had ""mistaken"" what they saw that day. Mark Summers KC, for Alhayek and Ankunda, said the idea that the image was a paraglider started with ""an internet group with an agenda"". He also argued that flying-related images were a common symbol of peace in the region. Reacting to the verdict, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said displaying the images amounted to the ""glorification of the actions"" of Hamas. Nick Price, head of the CPS special crime and counter terrorism division, said: ""The fact that these images were being displayed in the context of a protest opposing the Israeli response to the Hamas attacks demonstrates a glorification of the actions taken by the group. ""Displaying these images could be viewed as celebrating the use of paragliders as a tactic to breach the Gaza Israel border, and creates a risk of encouraging others to support Hamas. ""When people break the law - whether by hateful speech, supporting proscribed organisations or by threatening public order - we prosecute swiftly and independently. ""We have already prosecuted a string of offences linked to events in the Middle East and we are working closely with the police and community leaders to make sure our approach commands public confidence."" Their display of the images at the protest on 14 October was widely condemned when footage of the demonstration was published on social media, their trial was told. Clarification 22 February: This article's original headline said ""Protesters who celebrated Hamas found guilty"" and was amended on 14 February to make clear that this was the prosecution's argument and not the judge's.

Israel Gaza: Ceasefire talks resume as Rafah under firePublished13 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have resumed in Cairo, Egyptian media say. Senior officials from the US, Israel, Egypt and Qatar are meeting as Israel faces strong international pressure to stop its bombardment of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. About 1.5 million people are crammed into this small border town, amid fears of an Israeli ground offensive. Israel's PMrejected as ""delusional"" ceasefire proposals by Hamaslast week. Benjamin Netanyahu said ""total victory"" was possible in Gaza within months. He later ordered Israeli troops to prepare to expand their ground operation, and vowed to defeat Hamas gunmen hiding in Rafah. But UN human rights chief Volker Türk said any assault on the city would be ""terrifying"" and many civilians ""will likely be killed"". US President Joe Bidenhas called for civilians in the area to be protected. Rafah has come under heavy Israeli air strikes in recent days, with deaths and injuries reported. The discussions in Cairo are continuing despite Israel's rejection of Hamas's terms. Mr Netanyahu has sent his intelligence chief, David Barnea, to the talks to try to make further progress - Israeli media said he did so under American pressure. He is joined by the head of the US Central Intelligence Agency William Burns, Egyptian intelligence officials and Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani. There is a framework  for a temporary truce on the table, involving releasing Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a period of calm. Qatar and Egypt, with US support, have been going back and forth between Israel and Hamas to try to broker a deal. Israel says 130 hostages are still unaccounted for out of the 253 taken by Hamas-led gunmen during the 7 October attacks on southern Israel. More than 100 hostages have been released and three have been rescued by Israeli forces in Gaza -including most recently two male Israeli-Argentines in a military operation. Some hostages have died. At least 1,200 people were killed during the Hamas-led attacks. Israel launched military operations in the Gaza Strip in response to them. Some 28,473 Palestinians have been killed and more than 68,000 wounded in Gaza since 7 October, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. More than half of the Gaza Strip's population of 2.3 million is now crammed into Rafah, on the border with Egypt, which was home to only 250,000 people before the war between Israel and Hamas. Many of the displaced people are living in makeshift shelters or tents in squalid conditions, with scarce access to safe drinking water or food. Alongside the US, a number of countries and international organisations have warned Israel against launching its planned offensive. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron on Monday said Israel should ""stop and think seriously"" before taking further action in Rafah. EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged allies of Israel to stop sending weapons, as ""too many people"" were being killed in Gaza. And on Tuesday South Africa asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to consider whether the planned Israeli offensive required additional emergency measures to protect Palestinians' rights. Last month theICJ ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, in a case brought by Pretoria. Correction 19 February: A previous version of this article wrongly stated that two Israeli-Argentine hostages had recently been released by Hamas and has been amended to make clear that they were freed following an Israeli military operation.",2024-02-13T14:56:43.000Z

Why can't Labour remove its former candidate from Rochdale ballot papers?Published13 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Despite Laboursuspending its former candidate Azhar Ali, he will still appear on voting papers in Rochdale under the party banner. Electoral law means ballot papers effectively cannot be changed after publication. Ballot papers are ""a snapshot in time"", explains Peter Stanyon, the chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, The only exception to this is, he says, is in the event of a candidate's death. Mr Stanyon explains nominations must be closed 19 working days before the date of any election ""regardless of there being any change in circumstances"", and Mr Ali was confirmed as the Labour candidate on Friday 2 February. That means the party's withdrawal of support on Monday 12 February is too late to change the ballot paper before the by-election, which will take place on 29 February. He says: ""The ballot paper will be as it would have been had there not been the situation that's developed, so he will be on the ballot paper in alphabetical order with the description of the Labour Party candidate standing on behalf of the party. ""Even if the candidate decides they don't want to stand with the party ticket, it's a snapshot in time at the point they made their nominations, so you can't withdraw your party description or your candidate after the deadline."" The party has no control over what their former candidate does if elected, Mr Stanyon says, as ""ultimately the person being elected is the person not the party"". He adds: ""It would very much rest with Mr Ali - if he was elected and chose then to resign we're back into the same process again of another by-election with a new timescale running from whenever the day of that election is called."" Voters in Rochdale will also see Guy Otten listed as the Green Party candidate, despite having quit the race earlier this month. The main reason for the deadline being 19 working days before voting is because of postal voting, Mr Stanyon explains, with time needed for postal votes to go out internationally. The date of the poll is decided by MPs and the returning officer works backwards from that date, often scrambling to organise ballot papers, polling stations and staff on a short timescale. This is not the first time candidates who have had party support withdrawn have appeared as official candidates on polling day. Neale Hanvey was listed as the SNP candidate in the 2019 general election, despite having beensuspendedfrom the party for using antisemitic language. He was elected as the MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, andreadmitted to the SNP some months later.",2024-02-13T12:09:44.000Z

Israel Gaza: Biden says Israel must protect vulnerable in RafahPublished13 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"US President Joe Biden has said civilians who are ""packed"" into Rafah in the Gaza Strip are ""exposed and vulnerable"" and must be protected. Israel must make ""credible"" efforts to protect the more than one million Palestinians sheltering in the southern Gazan city, he said. Rafah has come under heavy Israeli air strikes in recent days, with a number of casualties reported. A Palestinian doctor told the BBC people in Rafah were living in fear. Last week, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced thathe had ordered troops to prepare to expand its ground operation to Rafah. He vowed to defeat Hamas gunmen hiding in the city. UN human rights chief Volker Türk said any assault would be ""terrifying"" and many civilians ""will likely be killed"".

Israel's military launched its operations in the Gaza Strip after at least 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas-led gunmen, who also took 253 people hostage. A number of those hostages were later released but Israel says 134 are still unaccounted for. Some 28,473 Palestinians have been killed and more than 68,000 wounded in Gaza since 7 October, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. On Sunday, Israel's military saidtwo male Israeli-Argentine hostages had been rescued during a raid in Rafah. President Biden again appealed for the protection of Rafah civilians after his meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah in Washington on Monday. He said any major military operation in the city ""should not proceed without a credible plan for ensuring the safety"" of those living there. ""Many people there have been displaced, displaced multiple times, fleeing the violence to the north and now they're packed into Rafah, exposed and vulnerable. ""They need to be protected. And we've also been clear from the start, we oppose any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza."" Last week, the White House said it would not support major Israeli operations in Rafah without due consideration for the refugees there. Meanwhile, Gaza's Hamas rulers said there could be ""tens of thousands"" of casualties in Rafah, warning that any operation would also undermine talks about a possible release of Israeli hostages held in the territory. The head of Israel's intelligence agency, David Barnea, CIA chief William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani met Egyptian officials in Cairo on Tuesday for further talks about a Gaza truce proposal, according to AFP news agency, which cited Egyptian outlet Al-Qahera News.

Why special election to replace George Santos matters beyond New YorkPublished13 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"George Santos walked the halls of Capitol Hill for less than a year as a congressman before his colleagues expelled him last December over allegations of fraud. Voting is now under way to pick his successor in New York's Third Congressional District, with the Republican and Democratic parties pouring millions of dollars into the race that ends on Tuesday. Former Congressman Tom Suozzi is running as the Democrat and local official Mazi Pilip, a black Israeli-American who served in the Israel Defence Forces, is the Republican candidate. The winner will represent parts of New York City and Long Island, and polls show the race is neck-and-neck. Mr Santos' antics may have dominated Washington for months, but voters in this district appear more focused on issues that will likely be a factor in the forthcoming presidential race - the Israel-Hamas war, immigration, and abortion. Both parties are now testing their political messaging in this swing district. With a razor-thin margin in the House of Representatives, Republicans are eager to win the race to more easily pass their legislative priorities before the election. Democrats, meanwhile, want to secure the seat to help their growing coalition and to gain traction before November. Following the 7 October Hamas attacks, both parties have vowed to back Israel. But in this district, which boasts a large Jewish population, that support could prove crucial to winning the special election. The issue is so important for both candidates that they appeared together at a January event in support of the Israeli hostages being held by Hamas. ""Your pain, our pain,"" Ms Pilip said to attendees. Ms Pilip is an Orthodox Jew who fled her home country of Ethiopia to Israel in 1991 to escape discrimination and later moved to the US. Recruited by the local Republican Party, she has represented Great Neck - a wealthy community in Long Island - in the Nassau County legislature since 2022. Mr Suozzi declared in February that he was ""unequivocally pro-Israel"" and condemned the recent failure by Congress to pass aid for Israel. He travelled to Israel just before Christmas to further illustrate his support. Jared Konsker, a 33-year-old Jewish voter in the district, told the BBC that he is backing Ms Pilip because she is a ""bigtime supporter of Israel, which is crucial in the time we're living in right now"". Not all Jewish voters are basing their vote solely on Israel, however. Ben Marzouk, a local Republican who was part of a grassroots effort to oust Mr Santos, said he was backing Mr Suozzi because of his experience in government. The record number of migrants crossing the US southern border has become a key driver for American voters this year, and the candidates in this special election are not ignoring it. Ms Pilip has sought to tie New York City's influx of migrants and the border crisis to Mr Suozzi and the Democratic party. Anthony D'Esposito, a Republican congressman who represents a neighbouring district and is a key surrogate for Ms Pilip, said the race was ""a referendum on policies that have failed the American people, in a district that is legitimately thousands of miles from the southern border"". In turn, Mr Suozzi has blamed Republicans in Congress for failing to passa bipartisan legislative packagethat would havereduced border crossings and limited asylum. The former congressman has not ignored the problem but ""leaned into"" it, according to Jay Jacobs, chair of the New York State Democratic Party. Abortion has proved a winning issue for Democrats since the US Supreme Court ruled in June 2022 that state governments can choose to ban the procedure. Ms Pilip, a mother of seven, has tried to thread the needle on the issue. At a televised debate on Thursday, she said that every woman should be able to make her own choice. ""I'm not going to force my own belief to any woman,"" she said, though she later admitted that she opposed abortion - a comment Mr Suozzi seized upon. Vivian Brash, 65, and her husband, both Great Neck residents, were torn on which candidate to support due to ""the Israel cause"". They chose to vote for Mr Suozzi because of the abortion issue. ""We have a daughter, we have granddaughters,"" Ms Brash told the BBC. ""It's important for women to make their own decisions."" Republicans want to move past the debacle that was their last congressman and Democrats have found that voters are not moved by using Mr Santos - who faces a multi-count federal indictment for money laundering, fraud and other charges - as a political cudgel. ""We've been without representation for so long, there's been a hunger to actually talk about the issues,"" said Kimberly Garber Keiserman, who led a grassroots voter group that formed to remove Mr Santos from office. Still, it is inarguable that Mr Santos is looming over the race. Mr Suozzi and his allies have cast Ms Pilip as ""Santos 2.0"" and reminded voters what happens when they choose a candidate with a short political resume. Ms Pilip has been accused by her opponent of not engaging enough with the public and the press, which has fed accusations that she, like Mr Santos, lacks transparency. But she maintains any parallels to Mr Santos are all created by Mr Suozzi. ""He wants to create these feelings of me and Santos in the same place,"" Ms Pilip said recently on Fox News. ""Come on, let's focus on the real issues.""",2024-02-13T03:21:15.000Z

Israel Gaza: Palestinians sheltering in Rafah fear impending offensivePublished12 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Palestinian doctor in Rafah has said people are terrified about the prospect of an Israeli ground offensive in Gaza's southern-most city, after a night of some of the worst air strikes he has experienced since arriving there. In a series of messages sent to the BBC on Monday, Dr Ahmed Abuibaid described the air strikes as incessant and everywhere. ""[The] most popular question on people's minds is, where can we go?"" he said. Last week,Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he had ordered troops to prepare to expand its ground operation to Rafah. More than half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million is now crammed into the city on the border with Egypt, which was home to only 250,000 people before the war between Israel and Hamas erupted in October. Many of the displaced people are living in makeshift shelters or tents in squalid conditions, with scarce access to safe drinking water or food. UN human rights chief Volker Türk warned an assault on Rafah would be ""terrifying, given the prospect that an extremely high number of civilians, again mostly children and women, will likely be killed and injured"". He also said it could mean that the ""meagre"" humanitarian aid getting into Gaza might stop, with most deliveries currently going through the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing. His warning followed unusually sharp criticism from the US last week, with President Joe Biden calling Israel's retaliatory campaign in Gaza ""over the top"". On Monday, Mr Biden said Israeli operations in Rafah ""should not proceed without a credible plan for ensuring the safety"" of civilians. Speaking after a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah, Mr Biden also said the US was working on a ceasefire deal lasting ""at least six weeks"". The UK Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron, said Israel should ""stop and think seriously"" before taking further action in Rafah. The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, on Monday urged allies of Israel to stop sending weapons, as ""too many people"" were being killed in Gaza. In an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu said Israel was ""working out a detailed plan"" to move civilians to areas north of the city. ""Victory is within reach,"" he said. ""Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying, 'lose the war, keep Hamas there.'"" The Israeli military launched a large-scale air and ground campaign in Gaza after Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel on 7 October and took 253 other people hostage. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 28,100 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting since then. One of the displaced people in Rafah is Dr Abuibaid, who was forced to abandon his job at Nasser Hospital in the nearby city of Khan Younis after his home was destroyed in an Israeli air strike and his father suffered a traumatic spinal injury. He is now facing the possibility of having to move out of Rafah - but it is unclear where would be safe for him to go. ""People are very scared about a possible military ground operation soon in the city,"" he said. Overnight Israeli strikes from Sunday into Monday,carried out during a operation to rescue two Israeli hostages, frightened many others who have sought refuge in the city. Abo Mohamed Attya said he was sleeping in a tent with his family when he woke up to the sound of the bombardment. ""Suddenly... missiles are being hit everywhere and firing as well and airplanes everywhere, all of this is on the tents and the people in the streets,"" he told the BBC. Mr Attya, who previously fled Nuseirat refugee camp in the middle of the Gaza Strip after receiving Israeli evacuation orders, complained that there had been no warning from the Israeli military that they were going to target Rafah overnight. ""We hoped there was a warning to evacuate like they did in Nuseirat and we went to Rafah. We would have went out of Rafah to anywhere they told us. We have no problem, we would evacuate for our children,"" he explained. The Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry said at least 67 people had been killed in the Israeli strikes and hostage rescue raid in Rafah overnight. ""There is no safe place anymore; nowhere is safe, even the hospitals are unsafe. One hopes to die instead,"" Mr Attya said. Aside from the continuing threat of Israeli air strikes and an impending ground operation, the situation for people in Rafah is made more difficult by the dire living conditions, with little access to water, food and sanitation, and rapidly dwindling medical supplies. Dr Abuibaid said he had observed many diseases among the people in Rafah and that they had been exacerbated by the ""severe decrease in the availability of drugs and treatment"". Another medic in Rafah, who did not want to be named, told the BBC that many people were living in cramped and unsanitary conditions. ""I live here with 20 people in two rooms... and I know people that are 100 people in three rooms."" ""We don't have water to wash, we don't have clothes, we don't have the option to do hygiene stuff,"" he said. ""My friends, all of the people I meet... all of them are having at least flu, cholera, diarrhoea, scabies, hepatitis A - which is a newcomer for us - and it's getting worse and worse."" ""And the aid is less as the siege is increasing, the war is increasing, [Israeli soldiers] are getting closer to Rafah, and it feels very scary right now,"" he said. Despite being located next to the only crossing point for goods and people between Gaza and Egypt, Rafah has not received nearly enough aid to satisfy the needs of the people there. One man in the city told the BBC that currently people were waiting days for aid deliveries, and that when they did arrive, supplies of water were insufficient. ""We can't find water nor do we get enough of it, our throats are dry from the shortage of water,"" another woman in Rafah said. The head of the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which is the largest humanitarian organization in Gaza, said on Monday that civil order was breaking down, with members of the local Hamas-run police force being killed or reluctant to protect aid lorries because of fears for their own safety. ""Yesterday, for the first time, the UN could not operate with a minimum of protection, which was local police. And because we had no local police, our trucks, our convoys at the border have been looted, and trucks have been vandalised by hundreds of young people."" For some of the displaced, however, fears of what could come next are even overriding their daily anxieties of finding drinkable water and food. ""Before we were thinking about starvation for the food, for the shortage of water and electricity. But now we are traumatised about what's the next step, where we should go. This is our daily life right now,"" Ibrahim Isbaita told the BBC. Asked where he and his family are considering going if they had to leave Rafah, Mr Isbaita said: ""I have actually no idea."" He said his mother needed dialysis treatment, which she is currently able to receive in Rafah when electricity supplies allow - though the treatment is less frequent than is needed. The fear is that if they move, she will not be able to find any treatment in the next place. ""I live besides the hospital because of my mother and we are trying our best to find a solution,"" Mr Isbaita added.",2024-02-12T21:50:39.000Z

Gaza war: What we know about Israel's Rafah hostage rescue raidPublished12 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Details have begun to emerge of an overnight Israeli military operation which freed two Israeli-Argentine hostages held captive by Hamas in the city of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip. Israeli forces carried out intense strikes in the area during the raid, which Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said killed dozens of people. This is what we know so far about what happened. They have been named as Louis Har, 70, and Fernando Marman, 60, who were kidnapped from the kibbutz of Nir Yitzhak on 7 October. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated southern Israel that day, killing 1,200 people and taking another 250 back to Gaza as hostages. More than 28,100 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response, according to the territory's health ministry. Both of the freed hostages have been taken to the Sheba Medical Center in central Israel, where they were said to be in a good condition. Videos and photos showedthe men walking around and embracing members of their families at the hospital. The first indications that something was taking place in Rafah werea series of intense Israeli strikes, which were reported shortly before 02:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Monday and caused panic in a city that is sheltering the majority of the estimated 1.7 million Palestinians displaced by the war. At 00:50, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that they had conducted strikes on ""terror targets"" in the Shaboura area of Rafah. One hour and 40 minutes later,the IDF put out a brief statement announcing the rescue of Louis Har and Fernando Marmanin a joint operation with the Israel Police's Yamam special forces unit and the Shin Bet security service. In the morning, IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari provided more details about what he described as a ""complex rescue operation under fire"", for which Israeli commandos had been preparing ""for some time"". ""In the early morning, at 01:49, the special forces breached into a building in the heart of Rafah,""he told a news briefing. ""On the second floor, Louis and Fernando were held by armed Hamas terrorists, who were present in the building along with terrorists who were in the adjacent buildings."" ""From the moment of the breach and entry into the apartment, Yamam forces shielded Louis and Fernando with their bodies, initiating a daring battle and heavy exchanges of fire at several locations simultaneously, with many terrorists."" Adm Hagari added: ""By 01:50, aerial fire was activated by the Israeli Air Force and Southern Command, to enable the force's disengagement and to strike Hamas terrorists in the area. ""At this stage, the forces extracted Louis and Fernando from the apartment and evacuated them under fire, accompanied by IDF forces who provided them protection in the Rafah area until they reached a safe zone."" A soldier was lightly wounded in the operation, according to Israeli media. ""I salute our brave fighters for the daring action that led to their release. Only continued military pressure, until total victory, will bring about the release of all of our hostages,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. During a week-long ceasefire in late November, 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were released by Hamas. Israel says 134 hostages are still being held, although about two dozen of those are presumed to be dead. Rafah residents said there was gunfire from attack helicopters and naval vessels in the early hours of Monday. At least two mosques and more than a dozen houses were reported to have been hit. Photos and videos taken in the Shaboura area in the morning showed a huge pile of rubble where multiple buildings were reportedly destroyed in Israeli strikes. Several large craters and the remains of plastic polytunnels could also be seen in adjoining agricultural land. ""We were asleep and then suddenly we saw heavy fire, lots of gunfire but we didn't know what was going on,"" resident Ziyad Seyam told Reuters news agency. ""There were unimaginable strikes hitting the homes."" Another man at the scene, Abu Abdullah al-Qadi, said his cousin was among those who were killed in the Israeli strikes. ""They stormed this building and it appears that they freed prisoners - and then they bombed it,"" he told AFP news agency. ""They bombed all the houses next to it."" Night-vision video footage of the rescue operationreleased by the IDF on Monday afternoon showed a number of commandos entering one of the buildings at the location, as well as an air strike on an adjacent building. Other photos and videos taken 1.6km (one mile) to the south-west showed that the al-Huda mosque in the centre of the city's densely populated refugee camp was destroyed. A gaping hole could be seen extending down from the building's roof. Khaled al-Taweel said he saw Apache and Cobra helicopters attacking targets in the area, as well as F-16 jets and drones. ""So much terror. Something you've never seen. Not in Hollywood in the US, not in Libya, not in Syria... Only in Rafah,"" he told Reuters news agency. At the nearby Kuwait Speciality Hospital, a Palestinian girl receiving treatment for shrapnel wounds to her neck said her father was killed when a camp for displaced people was struck. ""We were in the tent, me and all my family, when the bullets all came at us. My father went to see what's happening and said there were strikes, and a strike happened while he was talking,"" Mai al-Najjar told Reuters. Recent satellite images of the location where the hostages were held showed small clusters of tents less than 100m (330ft) away. A doctor at Kuwait Speciality Hospital said some of the casualties brought there after the strikes had suffered traumatic amputations of their legs and hands, and that they included children, women and the elderly. Footage from the facility also showed dead and wounded children. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said in a statement on Monday morning that at least 67 people had been killed and that the number could rise as rescue and recovery operations continued. Hamas described the attack as a continuation of Israel's ""genocidal war"" against the Palestinian people, while the Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry condemned what it called an Israeli ""massacre"" in Rafah.",2024-02-12T17:50:01.000Z

Israel to act on soldier misconduct after BBC investigationPublished12 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israeli military has told BBC Verify it will take action against any soldiers found to have filmed and uploaded footage online of Palestinian detainees stripped, bound and blindfolded. A BBC Verify investigation published on Friday analysed hundreds of videosin Gaza since November 2023, including eight showing detainees. Legal experts say the filming and publication of such videos could breach international law which says detainees must not be exposed to unnecessary humiliation or public curiosity. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially said it had terminated the service of one of the reservists identified by the BBC. It has now added that it will continue to act to identify unusual cases that deviate from what is expected of its soldiers. It also said ""significant command measures will be taken"" against soldiers involved in the footage identified by the BBC. The eight videos of detainees identified by BBC Verify were all posted by serving or former soldiers, who did not hide their identity. International human rights lawyer Sir Geoffrey Nice told the BBC's Today programme on Monday the filming and posting of such videos ""may well be a war crime"". Sir Geoffrey worked with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) between 1998 and 2006. In a video posted on 24 December 2023 by an IDF soldier, a Palestinian detainee is shown stripped and bleeding with his hands bound and sitting on a chair while being interrogated before being marched through the streets of Gaza barefoot. When asked about the circumstances of the photo by the BBC, the IDF said in a statement: ""The photo was taken during a field questioning. The suspect was not injured. A reservist photographed and published the picture contrary to IDF orders and values. It was recently decided to terminate his reserve service."" Another video, posted by the same soldier on the same day, shows hundreds of Palestinian detainees gathered in a sports field. Most of those in the video have been stripped to their underwear, some blindfolded and kneeling in rows, while Israeli soldiers look on. At one point, a group including three women are seen kneeling and blindfolded behind a football goal with an Israeli flag hung above it. Two videos uploaded by another IDF soldier include pictures of blindfolded detainees, interspersed with images of soldiers posing with guns All eight videos have since disappeared from social media platforms. Sir Geoffrey, a leading expert on war crimes, said there should be a wider investigation into the footage beyond the dismissal of one reservist. He told the Today Programme on Monday: ""The atmosphere in which soldiers operate reflects again the chain of command immediately above them and possibly the chain of command right to the top. That's something that always needs to be investigated."" When this allegation was put to the IDF spokesperson Peter Lerner, he told the same programme: ""There can be mistakes on the ground… We conduct our operations in the battleground and also in the questioning room within framework of laws, framework of instructions and when there are breaches of those, then they are treated [by] disciplinary or other methods.""",2024-02-12T17:15:41.000Z

Dutch court orders halt to F-35 jet parts exports to IsraelPublished12 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Dutch appeals court has ordered the government to block the delivery of parts for F-35 fighter aircraft to Israel over concerns they are being used to violate international law. The court sided with human rights groups who argued the parts provided from a Dutch warehouse contributed to law violations by Israel in Gaza. Israel denies committing war crimes. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 28,100 Palestinians have been killed in just over four months. Israel launched its operations in Gaza after about 1,200 people were killed by Hamas on 7 October, who also took 253 people hostage. ""It is undeniable that there is a clear risk the exported F-35 parts are used in serious violations of international humanitarian law,"" the Appeals Court in The Hague said. ""Israel does not take sufficient account of the consequences for the civilian population when conducting its attacks,"" the court added. The Dutch government has to comply with the order within seven days, but it could launch an appeal at the Supreme Court. The case against was brought by several groups, including the Dutch affiliate of Oxfam, in December. This was after the Dutch government decided that the export license for F-35 parts to Israel could continue despite Israel's siege on Gaza. A lower court had previously ruled that their export was primarily a political decision and that judges should not intervene, even though it said it was likely that F-35s contributed to violations of the laws of war. The US-owned F-35 parts are stored at a warehouse in the Netherlands and then shipped to other countries including Israel. In a separate case, the UN's top court last monthordered Israel to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. The order by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague came after South Africa asked the court to order Israel to stop military action straight away pending a decision on whether Israel has committed genocide. Israel rejected the accusation as ""wholly unfounded"".",2024-02-12T13:14:40.000Z

Israel rescues two hostages in Rafah amid deadly strikesPublished12 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel said two Israeli-Argentine hostages have been rescued in a raid in Rafah, amid heavy Israeli air strikes on the southern Gazan city. The Israeli military said the two men were in ""good medical condition"". The pair were named as Fernando Simon Marman, aged 60, and Louis Har, 70, from Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. Some 1.5 million people are sheltering in Rafah. The Hamas-run health ministry said dozens had been killed in the overnight strikes. It follows warnings from the international community over Israel's planned offensive in the city. The hostages were found on the second floor of a building in Rafah, said Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). He said Israeli forces had engaged in ""heavy exchanges of fire at several locations simultaneously, with many terrorists"". Abou Suhhaib, who lives in the Shaboura neighbourhood in Rafah, heard ""heavy shooting"" and ""strong explosions"" overnight. ""At approximately midnight, we heard the sounds of strong explosions, as if hell had opened on the civilians,"" he told AFP news agency. He described seeing a helicopter landing, adding, ""there was heavy shooting, as if it was a very big battle"". There are conflicting reports on Palestinian casualties from the air strikes: the AFP news agency reported that ""around 100 people"" were killed, citing Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that at least 50 people were killed, quoting local hospital officials. In a statement on social media, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that during an overnight ""joint operation between the IDF, ISA [Israel Security Agency or Shin Bet], and Israel Police, two Israeli hostages from Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak were rescued: Fernando Simon Marman (60) and Louis Har (70)"". The hostages were taken to Sheba Medical Center in central Israel for tests. Armon Aek, its acting director, said: ""I'm very happy to announce that this night, two released hostages landed here. ""They were received in our ER [examination room] and initial examination was conducted by our ER staff and they are in a stable condition."" They had been kidnapped by Hamas, the IDF said, in the 7 October cross-border attack that triggered the ground invasion. Mr Marman's niece said she was still ""shaking"" from the news of her uncle's rescue. ""When I saw him I couldn't believe he was real,"" Gefen Sigal Ilan told AFP. Israel's military launched its operations in the Gaza Strip after about 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, who also took 253 people hostage. A number of those hostages were later released. On Monday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 164 people had been killed and 200 injured in Gaza over the last day, although it is not clear exactly how many died in Israeli attacks overnight. The ministry says 28,340 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 68,000 wounded in the Strip since 7 October. A number of countries and international organisations have warned Israel against conducting its planned offensive in Rafah, where an estimated 1.5 million people have sought refuge. Most of them have fled from the rest of Gaza. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron earlier said ""over half of Gaza's population are sheltering in the area"", while Saudi Arabia warned of ""very serious repercussions"" if Rafah was stormed. Rafah - on the border with Egypt - is one of two open points of entry for humanitarian aid into Gaza -  the other is Kerem Shalom. On Sunday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that a Rafah offensive should not happen without measures to ensure the safety of civilians. Mr Biden said Israel needed a ""credible and executable plan"" to protect the more than a million people in the city, according to the White House. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted it will go ahead and a plan is being prepared. Meanwhile, Gaza's Hamas rulers said there could be ""tens of thousands"" of casualties, warning that any operation would also undermine talks about a possible release of Israeli hostages held in the territory. Correction 14 February 2024: This article has been amended to make clear that two crossing points are open for aid - Rafah and Kerem Shalom - not just Rafah as we originally reported.",2024-02-12T11:50:24.000Z

Nineteen of these are from Thailand. Boonthom Pankhong, 39, and his girlfriend,Natthawaree Mulakan, were released by Hamas on 24 November. Boonthom's sister Urai Chantachart told BBC Thai that the family was ""overjoyed"". ""Our family has been suffering for over a month, but we never thought he was dead. We strongly believed that he [was] still alive,"" she said. She added he had been working in Israel for five years when he was kidnapped, and was the family's main breadwinner. It was initially fearedWichai Kalapatwas among the Thai nationals killed in the Hamas raid until his girlfriend received word that he was being held hostage in Gaza.She told the BBC she was ""so happy""because she did not think he would be among those who were released. Seven other hostages were also released on the same day. Their names areUthai Thunsri, Buddee Saengboon, Bancha Kongmanee, Withoon Phumee, Mongkhol Phajuabboon, Santi Boonphrom,andUthai Sangnuan. Natthaphon Onkaew,Khomkrit Chombuawere among the four Thai nationals released on 25 November, according to the country's prime minister, Srettha Thavisin. Anucha Angkaewwas also freed. His wife, Wanida Maarsa, told BBC Thai that her husband, who had been working on an avocado farm for almost two years, was one of those taken captive by Hamas militants. The fourth person released wasManee Jirachat,who travelled to Israel for work four years ago. He was seized by Hamas along with five other workers who had taken cover together, according to a Thai TV interview with his father, who had spoken to survivors. It was announced on 26 November thatWichian Temthong, Surin KesungnoenandPhonsawan Pinakalohad been freed. Two more Thai hostages were released on Tuesday 28 November -O-wat SuriyasriandPattanayuth Tonsokri- and four were released the next day. Their names arePiboon Rattanil,Kong Saelao,Jakrapan SikenaandChalermchai Sangkaew. Gelienor ""Jimmy"" Leano Pacheco, 33,from the Philippines, was also released as part of the same deal. The father of three had been working in Israel as a caregiver to 80-year-old Amita Ben Zvi, who was killed in the attack on Nir Oz.",2024-02-12T09:59:47.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: 'Violent' strikes reported in Gazan city of RafahPublished12 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) charity says the Gazan city of Rafah has come under ""violent"" attack, with a number of deaths reported. Witnesses spoke of dozens of air strikes on the city's north and centre. The Israeli military said it had conducted a strikes in southern Gaza, without giving further details. It follows warnings from the international community over Israel's planned offensive in the city, where 1.5 million people are sheltering. The United Nations has said there is nowhere safe to go for the Palestinians who have ended up in the far south of the Palestinian territory. On Sunday, US President Joe Biden told Israel's prime minister a military operation in Rafah should not happen without measures to ensure the safety of civilians. In a call with Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Biden said Israel needed a ""credible and executable plan"" to protect the more than a million people in the city, according to the White House. Mr Netanyahu has insisted it will go ahead and a plan is being prepared. The call between the two leaders comes days after Mr Biden suggested Israel's military operations in Gaza were ""over the top"". It also follows a raft of Israel's allies, international organisations and regional powers expressing growing concern at suggestions Israeli troops would enter Rafah - which lies on the border with Egypt and is the only open point of entry for humanitarian aid. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said ""over half of Gaza's population are sheltering in the area"", while Saudi Arabia warned of ""very serious repercussions"" if Rafah was stormed. Many of the people are living in tents in refugee camps, having already been forced to flee their homes elsewhere in Gaza at least once on the orders of the Israeli military. Meanwhile, the Strip's Hamas rulers said there could be ""tens of thousands"" of casualties, warning that any operation would also undermine talks about a possible release of Israeli hostages held in the strip. The warnings about an escalation of fighting in Rafah came afterMr Netanyahu ordered his military to prepare to evacuate civilians from the cityahead of an expanded offensive against Hamas. Israel launched its operations in the Palestinian enclave after more than 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, who also took about 240 people hostage. On Sunday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 112 more Palestinians had been killed by the Israeli military over the previous day, bringing the overall death toll to more than 28,100 and more than 67,500 injured. In their call on Sunday, the White House said Mr Biden ""reaffirmed his view that a military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety of and support for the more than one million people sheltering there"". He repeated Israel and the US shared goal of seeing Hamas defeated and ensuring Israel's long-term security, while he also called for ""urgent and specific steps"" to increase humanitarian aid to civilians trapped in Gaza. Negotiators working on a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have made ""real progress"" over the last few weeks, a senior White House official told Reuters. The official said this deal was the main focus of the call between the Israeli and US leaders, but they also told the news agency that there were still some significant gaps to close. Mr Netanyahurejected Hamas's proposed ceasefire terms last week. In an interview with US broadcaster ABC News aired on Sunday, the Israeli PM said ""victory is in reach"" and the Israeli military were ""going to get the remaining Hamas terrorist battalions in Rafah"". He also said Israel would ""provide safe passage"" for civilians in the southern city. When pressed about where they should go, Mr Netanyahu suggested there were ""plenty"" of areas ""that we've cleared north of Rafah"" and insisted officials were ""working out a detailed plan"". ""Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying, 'Lose the war. Keep Hamas there,'"" he added. The US has alreadywarned Israel that an invasion of Rafah as part of its assault on Gazawould be a ""disaster"", while the EU and the UN both expressed their own concerns. Aid groups say it is not possible to evacuate everyone from the city. UN humanitarian co-ordinator Jamie McGoldrick, who has just been to Gaza to assess the situation, told the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher that people in Rafah would have ""nowhere to go"" if Israeli troops launched their offensive. ""The safe areas that were declared are no longer safe. And if these people have to move - where can they move?

Israel-Gaza war: Death and Israel’s search for ‘total victory’Published11 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"I'd rather be writing this story in the Gaza Strip, not Jerusalem. After many years of covering wars, since El Salvador in 1989, I'm convinced that nothing beats first-hand reporting. Unfortunately, in this terrible war, international journalists can't do that. Israel and Egypt, the two countries that control Gaza's borders, do not want us in there, reporting freely. Israel allows some closely supervised visits with its army. I have been on only one, back in November. Since we cannot get in, we rely on Palestinian journalists who can't get out. I have huge admiration for their courage and dedication to truthful reporting. Fortunately, in the modern world it is impossible to seal a war off. That is because ordinary people can film with a phone - and with a few clicks, post their pictures online. We can talk to them too, if communications haven't been cut. Israel and Hamas upload their own videos. Everything must be verified and checked, especially now that artificial intelligence is much easier to use. With all those constraints in mind, this is how the war looks on a February day from Jerusalem. Just after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, Yoav Gallant, Israel's defence minister, announced: ""We are putting a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no gas - it's all closed."" ""We are fighting human animals,"" he added, ""and we are acting accordingly."" Under pressure from US President Joe Biden, Israel now allows limited supplies of food, water and medicine into Gaza. Aid agencies and the UN cite considerable evidence that Israeli security checks slow the supply of relief into Gaza, and that Israel restricts the movement of relief convoys inside the Strip. Very little medical and food aid has reached northern Gaza this year. In response to this article, the Israeli embassy in London said claims by UN agencies about the food situation in Gaza were inaccurate and ""constitute support of Hamas propaganda"". Israel says that if aid is not getting through, it's because of the UN and aid agencies on the ground.  The statement added that ""Hamas steals aid from the residents of Gaza"". After four months of war, law and order in Gaza is in fragments. Aid convoys are looted every day.  Sunday 11 February was the worse day of looting so far in the south, according to the UN. It said what's left of the local police force stopped protecting convoys after eight of their men were killed in Israeli raids. Because we are not permitted to enter Gaza, we cannot check Israel's claims that Hamas is stealing the food. The UN's prime suspects are criminal gangs who sell it on. Judging by the few videos of looting that have emerged, desperate individuals are doing it too. ""I don't know who they are,"" Jamie McGoldrick, the UN's humanitarian coordinator told me. ""They're young guys, not in uniforms. They just come here and they stop us and take stuff off the back. And it turns up in the market sometimes. I wouldn't mind if desperate people got to use it but you see some stuff in the market which has been taken off our trucks.""  Mr McGoldrick said it was getting impossible to operate in such a lawless environment. Israel is increasingly sensitive about accusations that it is responsible for the suffering of civilians in Gaza, because of pressure from its allies, especially the US, and the genocide case it is facing at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Later this month, it has to show the court that it has improved conditions for non-combatants in Gaza. International aid groups say on top of the fact that innocent civilians in Gaza are being killed and wounded, they are also being starved and deprived of medical treatment. The Geneva Convention says that punishing civilians for crimes they did not commit amounts to collective punishment, which is a war crime. The Americans have since 7 October urged Israel to respect the laws of war in Gaza, specifically to stop killing so many Palestinian civilians. The fact that American officials, from President Biden downwards, keep repeating and strengthening their criticisms shows they believe Israel has ignored them. On his visit here this week, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued his most stinging public criticism yet of Israel's conduct of the war. The brutality of Hamas attacks on Israel, he said, cannot be used to justify brutalising Palestinians. ""Israelis were dehumanized in the most horrific way on October 7,"" he told a news conference in Tel Aviv. ""The hostages have been dehumanised every day since. But that cannot be a license to dehumanise others."" ""The overwhelming majority of people in Gaza had nothing to do with the attacks of October 7,"" Mr Blinken went on. ""The families in Gaza whose survival depends on deliveries of aid from Israel are just like our families. They're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, who want to earn a decent living, send their kids to school, have a normal life. That's who they are. That's what they want."" Even so, the US has chosen not to attach conditions to its huge military and diplomatic support for Israel. It continues to supply Israel with weapons, even though it does not approve of the way that they are being used. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general of UNRWA, the UN agency that is leading the humanitarian operation in Gaza, issued his own warning about the long-term consequences of the war for young people in Gaza when I spoke to him this week. ""I'm extremely worried,"" he said. ""They're all deeply traumatised by this unprecedented war. They're living in absolutely miserable conditions. Now, if the war ends tomorrow, our first priority should be to find ways to bring these children back into an education system… [or] we will just be sowing the seed of more resentment and hate in the future."" Israel will not be impressed by Mr Lazzarini's comments. It has made serious allegations against UNRWA, accusing it of aiding and abetting Hamas. Mr Lazzarini has been fighting to save the agency since Israel presented a dossier to the Americans saying about a dozen UNRWA staff took part in the 7 October attacks. UNRWA sacked the accused men and is trying to reassure the 16 major donor countries who have suspended its funding. Mr Lazzarini says he takes the allegations very seriously, is determined to root out any Hamas sympathisers, but Israel still has not given him the dossier it sent to the US. Israel believes UNRWA is rotten to the core. The crisis surrounding the agency is without a doubt another impediment to the aid operation. Northern Gaza is virtually inaccessible for the UN and other aid organisations. Information has trickled out, with local people living in the ruins reporting general starvation and widespread malnutrition among children that is likely to have life-long health consequences for those who survive. We get more information from southern Gaza, where getting on for two million people are trying to stay alive. Some 1.4 million are in Rafah, hard up against the Egyptian border wire. Most people live in tents made of plastic sheeting, next to pools of sewage. Unlike journalists, aid workers from the organisations involved in the relief effort can go in and out of Gaza. I've spoken to a range of UN officials with decades of experience in war zones. All have said it is the worst they have ever seen. One told me: ""I've never seen anything of this size and scale and depth."" Another said Gaza was the most dangerous and difficult place he had ever been, not just because of Israeli bombing, but because law and order had broken down. He said: ""There are many guns in Gaza, but as well as that, there are lots of big angry men with clubs."" The UN was moving aid convoys in the small hours of the morning to stop them being robbed. Palestinians in Rafah are approaching panic about a ground assault into the town by Israeli troops. A colleague from BBC Arabic spoke to Jabr al-Burdini, a middle-aged man in Rafah who had just been digging dead children out of the ruins of a neighbour's house. ""If there were Israeli operations here, thousands of people would be killed. The kids are terrified and so are the adults. Look at the children. They can't sleep."" Mr Lazzarini told me that a major Israeli assault on Rafah would ""add an additional apocalyptic layer in the Gaza Strip"". He said that some 5% of the population - about 100,000 people - had in the last four months either been killed, wounded or had disappeared, most likely dead under the rubble. ""And then you have the rest of the population now being concentrated almost in the open air in Rafah. And then you conduct a military operation in this place, you can only add an additional disastrous layer of tragedy. And this needs absolutely to be avoided."" Air strikes already kill many people in Rafah, but despite American calls for restraint, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has ordered the army to attack the town once it has a plan to move Palestinian civilians out of Rafah. Since nowhere in Gaza is safe, residents do not find that reassuring. Perhaps Mr Netanyahu is trying to mollify Mr Biden. Another potential audience might be the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which has ruled that Israel faces ""plausible"" allegations that it is committing the crime of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has set a high bar for victory that might be unattainable, even over many months. It wants to wipe out Hamas, restore Israel's security and free the hostages Hamas took on 7 October. Many of the families of Israelis held in Gaza and their supporters do not buy the prime minister's argument that only force will free the hostages. They want a ceasefire deal, as they fear that the longer the war continues, the less likely it is that they will ever see them again. Israel has inflicted considerable damage on Hamas, but it has not broken its capacity to fight. A senior Western intelligence official told me that Israel had killed about one-third of Hamas forces and destroyed about one-third of the tunnel network that makes Hamas such an obdurate enemy. Mr Netanyahu has also said Israel would like to kill Hamas leaders, starting with Yahya Sinwar, the man who it is believed instigated and directed the 7 October attacks. So far, Mr Sinwar and his closest lieutenants are believed to be alive, perhaps living in the tunnel network shielded by Israeli hostages. In four months, the shockwaves of the war in Gaza have spread out across the Middle East. Iran's network of allies, which it calls the axis of resistance, is engaged in the wider war. After three US soldiers were killed in Jordan by a militia trained and funded by Iran, the US started a rolling programme of air strikes in Syria and Iraq. With the UK, it has also bombed the Houthis in Yemen who are attacking shipping in the Red Sea. Hawks in the US and Israel want the American military to bomb Iran. The Houthis and Iran's other allies and proxies say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. The most powerful ally of Iran is Hezbollah in Lebanon. Its border war with Israel is getting more serious and more intense by the day. Pressure is growing inside Israel to send troops into southern Lebanon. The Americans are trying to construct a path to a peaceful future in the Middle East. Secretary of State Blinken has laid out a vision of Saudi Arabia normalising relations with Israel, if the Israelis allow the Palestinians to have an independent state of their own. Prime Minister Netanyahu says Palestinian independence will not happen. He insists Israel will press on until it achieves ""total victory"". This war goes on and there is no immediate prospect of a ceasefire. The longer it continues, the harder it will be to control the consequences of what is happening in Gaza.",2024-02-11T20:22:07.000Z

Netanyahu insists on Rafah offensive as warnings mountPublished11 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel is facing growing international warnings over its planned offensive in Rafah - the city in southern Gaza crammed with Palestinian refugees. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli military will go ahead with its planned ground offensive, insisting an evacuation plan is being prepared. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said ""over half of Gaza's population are sheltering in the area"". Saudi Arabia warned of ""very serious repercussions"" if Rafah was stormed. Dutch FM Hanke Bruins Slot also warned of ""many civilian casualties"", while the United Nations has said there is nowhere safe to go for the more than a million Palestinians who have already fled to Rafah. Gaza's Hamas rulers said there could be ""tens of thousands"" of casualties, warning on Sunday that any operation would also undermine talks about a possible release of Israeli hostages held in the strip. Israel launched its operations in the Palestinian enclave after more than 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, who also took about 240 people hostage. On Sunday the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 112 more Palestinians had been killed by the Israeli military over the previous day, bringing the overall death toll to more than 28,100 and more than 67,500 injured. Many Gazans have ended up in Rafah having been forced to flee their homes elsewhere at least once. Saturday's warnings came a day afterIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered his military to prepare to evacuate civilians from the cityahead of an expanded offensive against Hamas. The prime minister also rejectedHamas's latest proposed ceasefire terms. In an interview with US broadcaster ABC News aired on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu said ""victory is in reach"" and the Israeli military were ""going to get the remaining Hamas terrorist battalions in Rafah"".

Some 1.5 million Palestinians are believed to be in Rafah, seeking refuge from Israeli combat operations in the rest of the Gaza Strip. Most of them are living in tents. In a social media post, Mr Cameron said he was ""deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah. ""The priority must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out, then progress towards a sustainable, permanent ceasefire."" Meanwhile, Ms Bruins Slot described the situation in Rafah as ""very worrying"". ""Many civilians in Gaza have fled south. Hard to see how large-scale military operations in such a densely populated area would not lead to many civilian casualties and a bigger humanitarian catastrophe. This is unjustifiable,"" she added. Also on Saturday, the Saudi foreign ministry issued a statement that warned against ""targeting the city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip, which is the last resort for hundreds of thousands of civilians forced by the brutal Israeli aggression to flee"".

Lovelock Hostage Bridge to recognise Israeli hostages in GazaPublished11 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A new art installation recognising Israeli hostages held in Gaza has been opened in north London. The Lovelock Hostage Bridge was initially made up of 100 padlocks, each inscribed with the names of those taken on 7 October. Some of the padlocks have been left blank to represent those hostages who have died. The installation is located on the walkway outside JW3, London's main Jewish community centre in Camden. Family members of the hostages attended the opening and signed their own padlocks. Prominent members of the Jewish community, including Dame Maureen Lipman, Sir Simon Schama and Dame Margaret Hodge also attended. The installation was designed by artist Marcel Knobil, who said: ""Lovelock bridges around the world have become symbolic of people displaying love for each other, this lovelock hostage bridge does something more than that, it helps display our love and solidarity for the hostages."" He invited people to send their own signed padlocks to add to the bridge. ""Whatever creed, colour, belief, please come and show your sympathy by attaching a lock,"" he added. Dr Sharone Lifschitz, whose mother was released from Gaza in October, was one of the first people to attach a lock to the bridge. Her father, Oded Lifschitz, is still being held hostage. She said: ""We are [on] day 128 and it's human nature to want to move on, yet for me it is still 7 October, my father is still there....I have to do everything I can to bring him back."" Dame Maureen Lipman, who officially opened the bridge, said: ""It's a symbol, my religion is full of symbols....it screams louder than words....I hope that it sends out ripples and sends out waves."" Other famous faces including David Walliams, Mick Hucknall and Rachel Riley signed padlocks in advance. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London onSoundsand follow BBC London onFacebook,XandInstagram.

Gaza residents surviving off animal feed and rice as food dwindlesPublished10 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"People living in the isolated north of Gaza have told the BBC that children are going without food for days, as aid convoys are increasingly denied permits to enter. Some residents have resorted to grinding animal feed into flour to survive, but even stocks of those grains are now dwindling, they say. People have also described digging down into the soil to access water pipes, for drinking and washing. The UN has warned that acute malnutrition among young children in the north has risen sharply, and is now above the critical threshold of 15%. The UN's humanitarian coordination agency, Ocha, says more than half the aid missions to the north of Gaza were denied access last month, and that there is increasing interference from Israeli forces in how and where aid is delivered. It says 300,000 people estimated to be living in northern areas are largely cut off from assistance, and face a growing risk of famine. A spokesman for the Israeli military agency tasked with coordinating aid access in Gaza said in a briefing last month that there was ""no starvation in Gaza. Period."" The agency, Cogat, has repeatedly said it does not limit the amount of humanitarian aid sent to Gaza. The BBC spoke to three people living in Gaza City and Beit Lahia, and viewed footage and interviews filmed by local journalists in Jabalia. Mahmoud Shalabi, a local medical aid worker in Beit Lahia, said people had been grinding grains used for animal feed into flour, but that even that was now running out. ""People are not finding it in the market,"" he said. ""It's unavailable nowadays in the north of Gaza, and Gaza City."" He also said stocks of tinned food were disappearing. ""What we had was actually from the six or seven days of truce [in November], and whatever aid was allowed into the north of Gaza has actually been consumed by now. What people are eating right now is basically rice, and only rice."" The World Food Programme (WFP) told the BBC this week that four out of the last five aid convoys into the north had been stopped by Israeli forces, meaning a gap of two weeks between deliveries to Gaza City. ""We know there is a very serious risk of famine in Gaza if we don't provide very significant volumes of food assistance on a regular basis,"" said the WFP regional chief, Matt Hollingworth. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said there had been a sharp increase in the number of aid missions denied access to northern Gaza: with 56% of deliveries denied access in January, up from 14% in October to December. It also said the Israeli military ""at times required justifications"" for quantities of fuel destined for health facilities, and ""imposed reductions on the volume of assistance, such as the quantity of food"". The BBC asked Israel's army for a response. They directed us to Cogat, which told us to address our questions to the army. Duha al-Khalidi, a mother of four in Beit Lahia, told the BBC two weeks ago that she walked six miles (9.5km) to her sister's house in Gaza City, in a desperate search for food, after her children had not eaten for three days. ""I don't have any money, and even if I did, there's nothing in the town's main market,"" she said. ""[My sister] and her family are also suffering. She shared with me the last amount of pasta in her house."" ""We feel that death has become inevitable,"" her sister, Waad, said. ""We lost the top floor of our house, but we are still living here despite the fear of collapse. For two weeks, we can't find anything in the market; and if some products are available, they are 10 times their normal price."" A famine risk assessment, carried out by several UN agencies, estimated that almost a third of residents in northern areas could now be facing a ""catastrophic"" lack of food, though restrictions on accessing the area make real-time measurements very difficult. Families in northern areas are also struggling to find reliable water supplies. ""Many of us are now drinking unpotable water. There are no pipes; we have to dig for water,"" explained Mahmoud Salah in Beit Lahia. Video filmed in the Jabalia neighbourhood north of Gaza City shows residents sitting among the rubble of bombed out streets, digging down into the earth to tap large underground water pipes. ""We get water here once every 15 days,"" Yusuf al-Ayoti said. ""The water is dirty. Our children are inflamed and their teeth are eroded from the dirty water. There is sand in it, and it's very salty."" After four months of war, the makeshift solutions for bridging the hunger gaps are wearing thin. And there are few ways to restock Gaza's larder. The territory was reliant on food aid before the war; now much of its agricultural industry has been ruined or abandoned. New figures from the UN suggest that more than half the agricultural land in the central region of Deir al-Balah has been damaged. This includes an olive press and farmland belonging to Bassem Younis Abu Zayed. ""It looks like the aftermath of an earthquake,"" he said. ""The destruction is vast, covering neighbouring buildings and farm animals. Even if we manage to restore the mill, 80-90% of the olives have gone. It's not just a loss for this year, it's a loss for the next several years."" Further south, in the border town of Rafah, more than a million people displaced by the fighting elsewhere now jostle for space with the town's 300,000 residents. Israel's army regularly publishes what it says is recent footage of busy markets and restaurants in Gaza's southern centres. A majority of the 114 aid missions to southern areas of Gaza managed to get through last month, but residents and aid agencies say many people are still going hungry, and a public health crisis is looming with a lack of shelter, sanitation and medical care. Aid can be blocked by fighting, bureaucracy or rubble. Earlier this week, a food convoy waiting to head north in Gaza was hit by naval gunfire. On Saturday the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees accused Israel of using financial restrictions to block a month's worth of food for more than a million Gazans. UNRWA said more than 1,000 shipping containers from Turkey were being held up in a port, telling the AP news agency that a local contractor was ordered by customs authorities not to process any UNRWA goods. Israel has not responded but on Thursday, far-right finance minister Belazel Smotrich ordered the cancellation of customs and other tax relief for UNRWA, saying Israel ""will not give tax benefits to terrorist aides"". Israel has accused UNRWA staff ofparticipating in the 7 October attacks. But deliveries are also complicated by the growing desperation of Gaza's people, says Matt Hollingworth. ""We need the law and order issue resolved, so that we're not having to negotiate our way through crowds of desperately hungry people, to get to other people that we've yet to reach,"" he said. ""It's probably the level of helplessness that worries me. People have lost hope."" A deal between Israel and Hamas is seen by many as the only way to get more aid into Gaza, and get Israeli hostages out. As Israel bombs Rafah, ahead of a widely expected ground offensive there, leaders on both sides are under pressure to end the suffering of people trapped in Gaza - their enemy's, and their own.",2024-02-10T17:30:12.000Z

"Hind Rajab, 6, found dead in Gaza days after phone calls for helpPublished10 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","A six-year-old girl who went missing in Gaza City last month has been found dead, along with several of her relatives and two paramedics who tried to save her, after they appear to have come under fire from Israeli tanks. Hind Rajab was fleeing the city in a car with her aunt, uncle and three cousins at the time. Audio recordings of calls between Hind and emergency call operators suggest that the six-year-old was the only one left alive in the car, hiding from Israeli forces among the bodies of her relatives. Her pleas for someone to rescue herended when the phone line was cut amid the sound of more gunfire. Paramedics from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) managed on Saturday to reach the area, which had previously been closed off as an active combat zone. They found the black Kia car Hind had been travelling in - its windscreen and dashboard smashed to pieces, bullet holes scattered across the side. One paramedic told journalists that Hind was among the six bodies found inside the car, all of which showed signs of gunfire and shelling. A few metres away were the remains of another vehicle - completely burnt out, its engine spilling onto the ground. This, the Red Crescent says, is the ambulance sent to fetch Hind. Its crew - Yusuf al-Zeino and Ahmed al-Madhoun - were killed when the ambulance was bombed by Israeli forces, the organisation says. In a statement, the PRCS accused Israel of deliberately targeting the ambulance, as soon as it arrived at the scene on 29 January. ""The [Israeli] occupation deliberately targeted the Red Crescent crew despite obtaining prior coordination to allow the ambulance to arrive at the scene to rescue the child Hind,"" it said. The PRCS told the BBC that it had taken several hours to coordinate access with the Israeli army, in order to send paramedics to Hind. ""We got the coordination, we got the green light,"" PRCS spokeswoman, Nibal Farsakh, told me earlier this week. ""On arrival, [the crew] confirmed that they could see the car where Hind was trapped, and they could see her. The last thing we heard is continuous gunfire."" Recordings of Hind's conversations with call operators - shared publicly by the Red Crescent - sparked a campaign to find out what had happened to her. Hind's mother told us - before her body was discovered - that she was waiting for her daughter ""any moment, any second"". Now she is demanding that someone be held accountable. ""For every person who heard my voice and my daughter's pleading voice, yet did not rescue her, I will question them before God on the Day of Judgement,"" she told the BBC. ""Netanyahu, Biden, and all those who collaborated against us, against Gaza and its people, I pray against them from the depths of my heart."" At the hospital where she waited for news of her daughter, Hind's mother, Wissam, still holds the little pink bag she was keeping for her. Inside it, a notebook where Hind had been practising her handwriting. ""How many more mothers are you waiting to feel this pain? How many more children do you want to get killed?"" she said. We twice asked the army for details on its operations in the area that day, and about the disappearance of Hind and the ambulance sent to retrieve her - it said it was checking. We have asked again for their response to the allegations made by the Palestinian Red Crescent on Saturday. The rules of war say medical personnel must be protected and not targeted in a conflict, and that injured people must be given the medical care they need - to the fullest practical extent and with the least possible delay. Israel has previously accused Hamas of using ambulances to transport its weapons and fighters.",2024-02-10T11:34:33.000Z

Netanyahu orders military to plan evacuations from RafahPublished10 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the military to prepare to evacuate civilians from the southern Gazan city of Rafah ahead of an expanded offensive against Hamas. Some 1.5 million Palestinians are in Rafah to seek refuge from Israeli combat operations in the rest of Gaza. The US haswarned Israel an invasion of Rafahwould be a ""disaster"", while the EU and the UN both expressed concern. Aid groups say it is not possible to evacuate everyone from the city. Mr Netanyahu told military and security officials to ""submit to the cabinet a combined plan for evacuating the population and destroying the battalions"" of Hamas, his office said on Friday. ""It is impossible to achieve the goal of the war without eliminating Hamas, and by leaving four Hamas battalions in Rafah. On the contrary, it is clear that intense activity in Rafah requires that civilians evacuate the areas of combat,"" the statement added. Earlier this week, Mr Netanyahu said he had ordered troops to ""prepare to operate"" in Rafah and that ""total victory"" by Israel over Hamas was just months away. He made the comments while rejectingHamas's latest proposed ceasefire terms. The BBC has been told that negotiators for Hamas are leaving the Egyptian capital Cairo, with talks between the two sides now on hold. Most of the people in Rafah have been displaced by fighting in other parts of Gaza and are living in tents. Rafah is the only crossing point between Gaza and Egypt. On Friday, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell wrote in a post on social media: ""Reports of an Israeli military offensive on Rafah are alarming. It would have catastrophic consequences worsening the already dire humanitarian situation & the unbearable civilian toll."" Earlier in the week, UN Secretary General António Guterres warned of a ""humanitarian nightmare"" in the city. His spokesman Stéphane Dujarric later added: ""We are extremely worried about the fate of civilians in Rafah... I think what is clear is that people need to be protected, but we also do not want to see any forced displacement, forced mass displacement of people"". Meanwhile, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said there was ""a sense of growing anxiety and growing panic in Rafah"". ""People have absolutely no idea where to go after Rafah,"" Philippe Lazzarini told reporters in Jerusalem. ""Any large-scale military operation among this population can only lead to an additional layer of endless tragedy that's unfolding."" Reported Israeli air strikes on Gaza on Friday killed at least 15 people including eight in Rafah, officials from the Hamas-run health ministry said. Israel did not immediately comment. Garda al-Kourd, a mother-of-two who said she had been displaced six times during the war, said she was expecting an Israeli assault but hoped there would be a ceasefire agreement before it happened. ""If they come to Rafah, it will be the end for us, like we are waiting for death. We have no other place to go,"" she told the BBC from a relative's house in the city where she was living with 20 other people. Speaking on Thursday, without directly referring to Rafah, US President Joe Biden said Israel's actions in Gaza had been ""over the top"". He used the same ""over the top"" phrase earlier in the week to refer the Hamas response to a plan for a truce in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the Israeli military had a ""special obligation as they conduct operations there or anywhere else to make sure that they're factoring in protection for innocent civilian life"". ""Military operations right now would be a disaster for those people and it's not something that we would support,"" he said. More than 1,200 people were killed during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, according to Israeli officials. More than 27,900 Palestinians have been killed and at least 67,000 injured by the war launched by Israel in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-02-10T01:37:30.000Z

Brown University students enter eighth day of hunger strike over Israel-GazaPublished9 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A group of Brown University students have entered the eighth day of a hunger strike to pressure their school to divest from businesses they say benefit from Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. The 19 students began their protests on 2 February. They said they will continue until Brown officials consider divesting. It is likely the longest hunger strike in the US since the beginning of the ongoing Israel-Gaza war. The strike at the Ivy League university in Rhode Island has been organised by campus groups Palestine Solidarity Caucus and Jews for Ceasefire Now. It is led by both Palestinian and Jewish students, said Ariela Rosenzweig, one of the students striking. More than 27,900 Palestinians have been killed and at least 67,000 injured after Israel launched its campaign in the Palestinian enclave, according to the health ministry - which is run by Hamas. The campaign followed an unprecedented assault by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which more than 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed, according to Israeli officials. Ms Rosenzweig, 22, said it was inspired by a similar 11-day hunger strike on campus in 1986 which called for divestment from firms operating under apartheid in South Africa. ""I see our hunger strike as part of a lineage of student organising,"" she told the BBC on Friday, adding that it follows months of protest at the university, including a sit-in in November where 61 students were arrested. ""It is a desperate plea for the university to not only hear our voices, but the voices of thousands who have been murdered in Gaza,"" Ms Rosenzweig said. As part of the hunger strike, the students said they have only consumed water and pedialyte - an electrolyte solution - for over a week. They added they have spent each day at the university's campus centre, taking part in protests and other programming to raise awareness about Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza, and have received support from other students and faculty. Their action seeks to pressure Brown to consider a proposal recommending that it divest from companies that ""profit from human rights abuses in Palestine"". The 16-page proposal, penned in 2020by Brown's advisory committee on corporate responsibility in investment policies (ACCRIP), names 11 companies, including RTX Corporation, a weapons manufacturer and Northrop Grumman, a military company, among others. The strike was timed ahead of a series of closed meetings by the Corporation of Brown taking place Thursday and Friday, where the students hoped their demands would be discussed. In a letter sent to the students at the beginning of the hunger strike, Brown President Christina Paxson expressed concern for their wellbeing, but added that ""the bar for divestment is high"". ""It requires a demonstration that the University's investments in the assets of specific companies create social harm, and that divestment will alleviate that harm,"" she said in the letter, dated 4 February. The president added that the university rejects using the endowment ""as a tool for political advocacy on contested issues"". In an email, Brown spokesperson Brian Clark told BBC that the university is not directly invested in any defence stocks or large munition manufacturers. And while a large percentage of the university's endowment is overseen by third-party managers, he said Brown is ""confident that our external managers have the highest level of ethics and share the values of the Brown community, including the rejection of violence"". Sherena Razek, a PhD student and one of the organisers of the divestment campaign, said she believes the university's response shows ""a lack of regard"" for the students undertaking the hunger strike and their request. She noted that the university has used divestment in the past to protest other issues, like the South African Apartheid, the Darfur genocide in Sudan and the tobacco industry. Ms Rosenzweig said that given the university's divestment history, she and the other students believe their request is not impractical. The hunger strike began as Hisham Awartani, a Palestinian-American student, returned to Brown's campus after spending monthsrecovering from a gunshot wound to his spine. Mr Awartani, who is among the students supporting the calls for divestment, was one of three young Palestinian-Americans who were shot in Burlington, Vermont on Thanksgiving weekend, in what they believe was a hate crime. The suspected gunman, 48-year-old Jason Eaton, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of second-degree attempted murder. During the hunger strike, some students carried signs that read ""no others like Hisham"". The protests at Brown are among many that have taken place across American university campuses, which have becomethe backdrop to heated debateson the ongoing Israel-Gaza war since October. While it is likely the longest hunger strike in the US since October, it is not the first. Advocates, including Sex and the City actress Cynthia Nixon, staged a five-day hunger strike in November outside the White House calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. A Gazan man in Bristol was in hospital in December after being on a hunger strike for nearly two months over the war.",2024-02-09T21:27:16.000Z

"Israeli soldier videos from Gaza could breach international law, experts sayPublished9 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Videos of Gazan detainees stripped, bound and blindfolded that were filmed and uploaded online by Israeli soldiers could breach international law, legal experts say. International law says detainees must not be exposed to unnecessary humiliation or public curiosity. BBC Verify looked at hundreds of videos openly shared by Israeli soldiers in Gaza since November 2023. We verified eight showing detainees. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it has terminated the service of one of the reservists we identified, and videos like these do not represent its values. It did not respond to any further request for comment. Dr Mark Ellis, a leading expert and chair of a UN-created advisory panel on international criminal tribunals, said the footage we showed him from Israeli soldiers might violate the recognised rules for treating prisoners of war. Most of the videos we analysed show scenes of fighting and soldiers looking through homes abandoned by residents. One video shows soldiers launching weapons dressed up as dinosaurs, and others show them setting up a pizza restaurant in an empty Palestinian home. But we found eight, filmed and shared publicly, which legal experts say show the ill-treatment of Palestinian detainees. They were all posted by men who are or were serving soldiers, who did not hide their identity. We uncovered one account by analysing an image of a Palestinian detainee which was widely shared online earlier this week. Reverse image search tools show it came from the YouTube account of Israeli soldier Yossi Gamzoo. He has uploaded multiple videos from Gaza since early December, including shots of his troop, which he identifies as the Granite Battalion 932, which is part of the IDF's Nahal Brigade. In a video posted on 24 December 2023, the Palestinian detainee from the image is shown stripped and bleeding with his hands bound and sat on a chair while being interrogated. We identified the location as Gaza College, a school in the north of the strip, from the distinctive decor as well as the institution's logo which can be seen in the video and which we matched to its Facebook page. Later in the same video, the detainee is seen being marched barefoot through the streets of Gaza. In a statement, the IDF said: ""The photo was taken during a field questioning. The suspect was not injured. A reservist photographed and published the picture contrary to IDF orders and values. It was recently decided to terminate his reserve service."" On the same day, Mr Gamzoo posted another YouTube video showing hundreds of Palestinian detainees gathered in a sports field, which we geolocated and verified as Gaza's Yarmouk stadium. Most of those in the video have been stripped to their underwear. Some are blindfolded and kneeling on the ground in ordered rows, while Israeli soldiers watch on. At one point, a group including three women detainees appear kneeling and blindfolded behind a football goal with an Israeli flag hung above it. An Israeli soldier appears in the video several times, and appears aware he is being filmed. By comparing his uniform and insignia with other publicly available images of IDF uniform online, we identified him as lieutenant colonel, or battalion commander. Both videos were taken down from Mr Gamzoo's public YouTube page soon after the BBC contacted the IDF. Two videos uploaded to TikTok by another IDF soldier include pictures of blindfolded detainees, interspersed with images of soldiers posing with guns. One posted on 14 December, set to an Israeli rap song, includes an image of blindfolded detainees packed into a pick-up truck with a soldier posing next to them with his thumbs up. We identified the soldier from his other social media accounts as Ilya Blank. He posted a second video that includes an image of a blindfolded man on the floor, surrounded by what appear to be three IDF soldiers. We have located a number of the photos used in his videos to northern Gaza. After we contacted the IDF and TikTok, the videos were taken down. Article 13 of the Third Geneva Convention states prisoners of war must be protected at all times, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against ""insults and public curiosity"". Dr Ellis, who is executive director of the International Bar Association, says the key is ""not creating a public curiosity"" for prisoners of war and not ""degrading them or humiliating them"". He added: ""The idea of walking people through in their underwear and filming that and sending it out certainly would violate that. ""The rules that are set down would not in any way allow this type of act."" Prof Asa Kasher, an Israeli academic who helped write the IDF's first code of conduct, said sharing the pictures of half-naked people was against the IDF's code of ethics. He said there could be a military need to briefly strip a detainee in order to check if they were armed, but that he could not see a reason for ""taking such a picture and sharing it with the public"". ""The reason for holding them half-naked is to humiliate them,"" he said. Human rights lawyer Michael Mansfield said the footage should be assessed by a UN court. ""There is a very severe restriction on how you deal with people who are detained who are prisoners of war in a time of war or conflict, which this plainly is, and that provision is really one in which you are intended to treat prisoners with respect,"" he said. We sent six videos to TikTok, who confirmed that they were all in violation of their community guidelines. They said their guidelines were clear that content ""that seeks to degrade victims of violent tragedies"" was not tolerated. The videos have all since disappeared from the platform. A spokesperson for YouTube said it had removed tens of thousands of harmful videos and terminated thousands of channels during the conflict between Israel and Gaza, and that it had teams working around the clock to monitor for harmful footage content. Additional reporting by: Paul Brown, Alex Murray, Thomas Spencer, Paul Myers, Richard Irvine-Brown and Daniele Palumbo. Correction 26 February: An earlier version of this article referred to a Yossi Gamzoo Letova (the name given on social media profiles). The Israeli embassy in London has subsequently clarified that the IDF said there was previously an IDF reservist named Yossi Gamzoo rather than Yossi Gamzoo Letova.",2024-02-09T19:53:55.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: US says it will not back unplanned Rafah offensivePublished9 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The US has warned Israel that staging a military offensive into Gaza's southern city of Rafah without proper planning would be a ""disaster"". Some 1.5 million Palestinians are surviving in the city bordering Egypt in dire humanitarian conditions. The White House said it would not support major operations without due consideration for the refugees there. The comments come days after Israel's leader said the military had been told to prepare to operate in Rafah. Speaking on Thursday evening, and without referring to Rafah, US President Joe Biden said Israel's actions in Gaza had been ""over the top"". Reported Israeli air strikes on Gaza on Friday killed at least 15 people including eight in Rafah, officials from the Hamas-run health ministry said. Israel did not immediately comment. Salem El-Rayyes, a freelance journalist living at a camp for displaced people in Rafah, said children were among those killed when an air strike hit a house nearby. Bodies of the victims ""flew from the third floor"", he told Reuters. Most of the people in Rafah have been displaced by fighting from other parts of Gaza and are living in tents. Garda al-Kourd, a mother-of-two who said she had been displaced six times during the war, said she was expecting an Israeli assault but hoped there would be a ceasefire agreement before it happened. ""If they come to Rafah, it will be the end for us, like we are waiting for death. We have no other place to go,"" she told the BBC from a relative's house in Rafah where she was living with 20 other people. The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, told the BBC that such an operation in Rafah - which he called ""the world's biggest displacement camp"" - would be a catastrophe. ""There are people on their flimsy plastic sheeting. They are fighting for food. There is no drinking water. There is epidemic disease and then they [the IDF] want to bring a war to this place. You can't make it up really,"" he said. Much of northern and central Gaza has been reduced to ruins by sustained Israeli bombardment since the war began on 7 October. Earlier, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the Israeli military had a ""special obligation as they conduct operations there or anywhere else to make sure that they're factoring in protection for innocent civilian life"". ""Military operations right now would be a disaster for those people and it's not something that we would support,"" he said, adding that the US had not seen anything to suggest Israel was going to launch a major operation in Rafah imminently. Deputy State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel echoed Mr Kirby's comments, saying: ''We [the US] would not support the undertaking of something like this without serious and credible planning."" Asked by the BBC where refugees in Rafah should go in the event of an operation, Mr Patel said these were ""legitimate questions that we believe the Israelis should answer"". Speaking in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said any ""military operation that Israel undertakes needs to put civilians first and foremost... and that's especially true in the case of Rafah"". It is rare for the US, a key ally and military backer of Israel, to talk about any forthcoming stages of the country's military offensive in Gaza - but this was a clear warning. Washington sends around $3.8bn (£3bn) in military aid to Israel each year, making the country the world's biggest recipient of such funding. Around 1,200 people were killed during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, according to Israeli officials. More than 27,800 Palestinians have been killed and at least 67,000 injured by the war launched by Israel in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. ""They are living in overcrowded makeshift shelters, in unsanitary conditions, without running water, electricity and adequate food supplies,"" was the stark assessment of the situation by UN chief António Guterres on Thursday. ""We were clear in condemning the horrific acts of Hamas. We are also clear in condemning the violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza.""

"Labour lost Muslim voters' trust over Gaza, says MP Shabana MahmoodPublished9 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Labour's shadow justice secretary has said there has been ""a loss of trust"" from British Muslims in her party over its position on the Israel-Gaza war. Shabana Mahmood - one of Labour's most senior Muslim MPs - has urged it to ""rebuild"" relations with Muslim voters. Ten Labour frontbencher MPs resignedover the party's initial reluctance to call for a ceasefire in the region. Labour has since revised its position to call for a humanitarian halt in the fighting and a ""sustainable ceasefire"". Speaking onPolitical Thinking with Nick Robinson, Ms Mahmood said she ""wanted a ceasefire then, I want a ceasefire now"". It was ""impossible to look at footage of dead children being pulled from the rubble"" and to not ""want the fighting to stop"", she added. ""I wish it were possible, simply by calling for it, that you could immediately deliver"" a ceasefire, she said. ""The question is not so much, do you just call for it, but how you actually deliver one?"" Israel declared war on Hamas after the group led an attack on communities inside Israel, killing about 1,200 people. Since then more than 27,700 Palestinians have been killed and at least 65,000 injured by waves of missiles launched by Israel into the Gaza Strip in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Asked about Ms Mahmood's comments, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Israel-Hamas conflict had ""caused great concern across the country"". He said the party wanted to see a ""sustainable"" ceasefire, including more aid deliveries, the release of hostages taken by Hamas, and steps towards a two-state solution, alongside a stop in the fighting. ""In the end, I think we all want to see the same thing,"" he added. The war between Israel and Hamas has triggered several conflicts within the Labour Party. A flashpoint came when Sir Keir gaveaninterview to radio station LBC in October, in which he appeared to claim Israel had a right to cut off power and water from Gaza. He later denied he had meant to support Israel cutting off supplies to the territory, saying he was instead supporting Israel's right to defend itself. Ms Mahmood admitted ""that was not a good moment"" for her party. Tensions again boiled over when 56 Labour MPs defied party orders and voted for an SNP motion in the House of Commons calling explicitly for a ceasefire. Asnapshot pollin November revealed that 41% of Muslim voters say they feel more negatively about Labour since the outbreak of the conflict. Among Muslim voters ""there has been a sense of a loss of trust, and I think that that needs to be rebuilt, ""she said. ""We aspire to be a party that can get votes from every part of our country and every community in our country. That has always been the Labour way and still the Labour way."" However, it is not just Muslims in Britain who are ""feeling a very strong sense of, pain at what's unfolding. So do all British Jews"". ""We are all British citizens together,"" she added. ""I think that if we lose our sense of humanity for what is being suffered by all of the peoples in that region, I think we lose something very, very important and very precious. And once gone, I think it's very difficult to get back."" She also criticised both Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for blocking a two-state solution. ""We have to urgently find partners for peace, because a one state solution does not make the people of Israel safe,"" she said. ""And it is an outrage to adopt a position that says that the people of Israel can have self-determination, but the people of Palestine cannot."" On Thursday, Mr Netanyahurejected proposed ceasefire termsfrom Hamas- saying ""total victory"" in Gaza is possible within months.

Senate advances aid package for Ukraine and IsraelPublished8 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsWar in Ukraine,"The Senate has advanced an aid package for Ukraine and Israel a day after Republicans blocked a larger bipartisan border security and foreign aid bill. Pushing through an initial hurdle, lawmakers voted 67-32 to consider the $95b (£75.2b) aid package. Democrats are in favour of passing the aid, but Republicans remain divided. The new bill strips out several US border measures from a $118b bipartisan package that Senate Republicans voted down on Wednesday. The fate of this latest version remains unclear, and there is still much disagreement among Republican senators that could cause the process to drag on for days. If the Senate goes on to approve the aid, it must still be passed by the House of Representatives - a chamber with a Republican majority that has not been eager to approve such funding. This could be Congress's last shot at passing Ukraine aid for the foreseeable future, however, and Ukraine has warned that it may not be able to successfully defend itself against Russia without Washington's backing. The US, which is the biggest provider of aid to Ukraine, has been unable to provide further aid since December because of the political gridlock in Congress. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer - who drafted the measure - called the vote a ""good first step"" and pledged to ""keep working on this bill - until the job is done"". The bill includes $60bn of military aid for Ukraine and $14.1bn in security assistance for Israel. It also provides $9.15bn in humanitarian funding for civilians in countries facing conflict. After rejecting the initial bill, Senate Republicans have now agreed to consider this foreign aid version of the measure. They have kept open the possibility of making further changes, however. It is possible Republicans could add some of the border measures that were stripped out of the original bill, or remove some elements of the funding the legislation would provide. The White House had asked Congress months ago to pass a bill that included foreign aid. Their proposal mirrors the one now under consideration. Republican lawmakers had demanded that any bill be linked to strict border security measures, citing a crisis at the southern border. Negotiations over those provisions slowed the process and flow of aid for months. But after former President Donald Trump recently attacked the agreement reached by a bipartisan group of senators, several Republicans rejected the new bill. In this latest vote, 17 Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, voted in favour of advancing the stripped down bill. Sen Jim Lankford - an Oklahoma Republican who helped lead negotiations for the border bill - opposed the stand-alone measure, alongside independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. ""I want to be here a week, because I want to talk about what a disaster the bill is and what a mistake it is to send our money to other countries before we fix our own problems here,"" said Mr Paul, who pledged to slow the process further.",2024-02-08T19:01:42.000Z

Israel chooses Eurovision 2024 entrant amid calls for a boycottPublished8 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Singer Eden Golan has been chosen to represent Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest, as organisers face calls to ban the country over the war in Gaza. Golan, 20, was selected in a TV talent show after performing Aerosmith's I Don't Want To Miss A Thing. She dedicated the song to the more than 130 Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza. ""We won't truly be OK until everyone returns home,"" she said. But musicians in several countries have called for Israel to be suspended. In December, Iceland's Association of Composers and Lyricists published a statement saying Israel's military action in Gaza made its participation incompatible with an event ""characterised by joy and optimism"". A petition calling for Israel to be expelled has garnered about 10,000 signatures - almost 3% of the country's population. If Israel is allowed to perform, Iceland should pull out, it said. In Finland, a petition signed by more than 1,400 music industry professionals accused their national broadcaster Yle of double standards, saying it was among the first to demandthe ban on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. ""We expect the same active defending of values from Yle now as well,"" they said. Musicians in Norway and Denmark have written similar letters, while a Swedish open letter - signed by pop stars including Robyn, Fever Ray and First Aid Kit - accused Israel of war crimes. ""Allowing Israel's participation undermines not only the spirit of the competition but the entire public service mission,"" they wrote. Before he was selected to represent the UK, Olly Alexander also endorsed a statement accusing Israel of genocide. An Israeli official later told the UK's Telegraph newspaper the arguments were ""absurd"" and accused Alexander and his fellow signatories of ""anti-Israel bias"". So far, Eurovision organisers have resisted calls for Israel's exclusion, saying the situations in Ukraine and Gaza are different. ""Comparisons between wars and conflicts are complex and difficult and, as a non-political media organization, not ours to make,"" Noel Curran, the director general of the European Broadcasting Union said in a statement. ""We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East,"" he said. However, he added, Eurovision was ""not a contest between governments"". ""The EBU is aligned with other international organizations, including sports unions and federations and other international bodies, that have similarly maintained their inclusive stance towards Israeli participants in major competitions at this time,"" the statement concluded. The Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which governed Gaza, launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, which killed 1,200 people - mainly civilians. The group took about 250 people back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered Israel's military offensive, which has killed nearly 28,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel's televised selection process itself was overshadowed by the conflict. Initially due to air in October, it was postponed after the Hamas attack. Three singers who had auditioned for the show were among the concertgoers massacred by gunmen at the Supernova Music Festival. Another contestant - 26-year-old Shaul Greenglick - dropped out of the contest in December when his military reservist duty resumed, and was killed in Gaza on 26 December. His family performed a song in his memory during the final of the show, called Hakochav Haba (The Next Star). Despite calls for Israel to be excluded, the country is currently fifth favourite to win with bookmakers - with some expecting a surge of support for it. Speaking after her selection, Golan said she hoped to carry a positive message to the contest in Sweden. ""It's a dream, in particular this year, when it has even more meaning,"" she said. ""It's to show the whole world who we really are, and to bring our country in three minutes to the stage, and to show our emotion and our strength and our people - that we are here, forever, together."" Israel's public broadcaster, Kan, which is responsible for organising the country's entry, has stipulated her song must contain some Hebrew lyrics, ""in light of the complicated period"". Golan, who was born in Israel but raised in Russia, won't be the only Israeli on the Eurovision stage this year - Luxembourg's Tali Golergant is also an Israeli native. Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.",2024-02-08T11:20:29.000Z

Exhibition of Palestinian art opens in central LondonPublished8 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An exhibition of Palestinian art has opened its doors at the P21 Gallery in central London. It comes at a divisive time in the art world. Several venues in Europe and North America have cancelled exhibitions and events with Palestinian and pro-Palestine artists, mostly due to comments made over the Israel-Gaza war. And in Istanbul, works of Israeli artists were removed from an exhibition to avoid protests from the public. ""From Palestine with art"" was already showcased at the 2022 Venice Biennale but the organisers say, given the current climate, they feel the need to bring it back into the spotlight. ""We're trying to project the true image of Palestinians: we're people who like peace, we're human,"" says curator and director of the Palestine Museum US, Faisal Saleh. He walks me through the two floors of the exhibition, giving me little anecdotes on some of the 20 artists who are showcased here. Walking among bright paintings, intimate photos and bronze sculptures, you cannot help but get the sense of the vivacity of an art scene that is rarely talked about. Eventually, Mr Saleh stops in front of a painting portraying faceless people wandering aimlessly in an abstract space. The author, Mohammed Alhaj, is a painter from Gaza. ""It could be the US-Mexico border, it could be the border between Turkey and Greece,"" Mr Saleh says. ""When Mohammed Alhaj painted this in 2021, he meant it to be universal. He had no idea it was going to be him,"" he adds, referring to the ongoing war. Mohammed Alhaj is one of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced in Gaza since the war began. He has been sheltering with his family in a tent in Al Mawasi, in southern Gaza. It is a narrow strip of land by the sea, with few buildings and mostly consisting of sandy dunes and agricultural land. In recent weeks, communications have become increasingly difficult, but I managed to speak with him briefly via voice messages. ""The situation is really bad, I can't describe how bad it is,"" he told me. ""Salty water is difficult to get, drinking water is difficult to get. The days are exhausting. Those who had money, are running out. Those who had the ability to endure this, no longer have strength."" Mr Alhaj tells me he is now trying to get out of Gaza with his wife and four children through the Rafah border crossing. At the exhibition, one whole wall is reserved for landscape paintings. They tell the tale of a beautiful, war-torn land. In some of them, among lush olive groves, you can spot signs of roadblocks and Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Two of these paintings are by known graffiti artist Taqi Sabateen, who lives in a village there. ""I did a painting full of hope, no struggling, no violence,"" he tells me on a call a few days before the exhibition. ""I took this chance to show people the beauty of Palestine."" When I ask him how he feels having his work on display in London, he takes a deep sigh. ""This exhibition is an emergency archive,"" he says. ""My friends in Gaza are sending me photos of their studios, all their paintings have been damaged. These paintings that are [in London], are on the safe side."" ""It's good. I feel like I have part of me out of this mess."" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London onSoundsand follow BBC London onFacebook,XandInstagram.

Stabbing of US Palestinian a hate crime - Texas policePublished8 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Texas investigators say the stabbing of a Palestinian-American man protesting against the war in Gaza meets the police definition of a hate crime. The alleged attack took place on Sunday near the University of Texas in Austin. The suspect allegedly rode a bike up to a truck carrying four Muslims and tried to rip down a scarf from the vehicle bearing the words ""Free Palestine"". On Wednesday, Austin Police Department officials said Bert James Baker, 36, had committed a hate crime. The ruling from the police Hate Crimes Review Committee says that it will now be up to the Travis County District Attorney's Office to determine what charges he will ultimately face. Zacharia Doar, 23, was stabbed in the chest during a fight with Mr Baker, according to a police report of the incident. The group was attacked after attending a pro-Palestinian protest at the state capitol, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which has advocated for hate crime charges against their attacker. Mr Baker is accused of trying to open the truck's tailgate, and yelling racial slurs at the group in order to provoke a fight, according to the police report. One witness told theAustin American-Statesmennewspaper that he helped by using the scarf - a traditional Palestinian keffiyeh - to staunch the bleeding. ""In that moment, it was just extremely terrifying,"" said Suhaib Shah. ""Just seeing the amount of pain that this guy was in who had been stabbed and how much he was bleeding and just seeing how distraught the kids were."" Mr Doar has undergone surgery and is now in recovery, his family says. Attacks on Muslims and Jews have risen since the 7 October attack by Hamas and Israel's ground invasion of Gaza. In November, three men of Palestinian descent in Vermont were shot while wearing keffiyehs and speaking Arabic during a walk.",2024-02-08T02:33:52.000Z

'We are surrounded': Guarding the Middle East's most dangerous borderPublished8 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"It is a lonely drive to Israel's most northern town, Metula, along a spur of land that is surrounded on three sides by Lebanon. That means it is also surrounded on three sides by Lebanon's most powerful armed group, Hezbollah. The soldiers at the checkpoint on the edge of Metula were all local men, mostly middle-aged reservists with no illusions about the force on the other side of the border. As the rain lashed down on a miserable, foggy night, one of them, who did not want his name to be published, used his finger to traverse the compass, pointing to the border and Hezbollah's positions. ""To the west a quarter of a mile, to north half a mile and another half mile to the east. So, we are 300 degrees surrounded by the Hezbollah."" The other 60 degrees, he said, included the steep road back down to the rest of Israel. The Gaza war that started after Hamas attacked on 7 October, killing around 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, has been devastating. The Israeli offensive that followed has, so far, killed well over 27,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and inflicted severe damage on Gaza. The border conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that followed has steadily intensified, but all sides know how much worse it would get if it exploded into a high-intensity war. It was stark and clear to the men on guard on the edge of Metula. The Israeli reservist continued: ""Yes, it definitely can turn into a big war and a big war with Hezbollah is not like Hamas, they are a real army, very trained, greatly equipped and they have a lot of experience, real experience in Syria."" Hezbollah intervened in the war in Syria, fighting for the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has no plans to visit Metula on his current Middle East tour, but the long flight from Washington and the travelling times between different capitals in the Middle East must be grimly familiar to him by now. He is back in the region for the fifth time since 7 October. Mr Blinken has not tried to minimise the magnitude of the crisis in the Middle East. At the end of January, standing next to the secretary general of Nato, he said it was ""incredibly volatile… I would argue that we have not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we're facing now across the region since at least 1973, and arguably even before that."" That is quite a comparison. The Middle East war of 1973 turned into one of the most dangerous superpower confrontations of the Cold War. With US President Richard Nixon submerged by the Watergate scandal, his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger ordered US strategic forces on to their highest level of peacetime alert, Defcon 3, after a report that the USSR was moving nuclear weapons to the Middle East. Half a century on Mr Blinken was speaking after militias trained and funded by Iran killed three American soldiers at a base in Jordan. Since then the US, helped in Yemen by the UK, has started a rolling campaign of retaliatory air strikes. The Americans hope they have calibrated their response to stabilise matters, not make them worse, but that is not at all certain. Hawkish critics of President Biden in Washington DC say that action taken so far will not deter Iran, which backs Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen as well as Shia militias in Syria and Iraq. The hawks say only attacks on Iran itself will force Tehran to order its proxies and allies to stand down. The Biden administration believes attacking Iran itself risks detonating a wider conflict in the Middle East. On previous trips Secretary Blinken has repeatedly expressed America's support for Israel's war against Hamas, but also grave doubts about the way Israel is fighting. Washington has called, unsuccessfully, for restraint. The US has continued to supply Israel with the weapons it needs for its campaign, despite its reservations about the way they are being used. The US has had more success in forcing Israel to let in much more humanitarian aid to more than two million Palestinian civilians who are trapped in the catastrophe. Last October, Israeli leaders said nothing would be allowed in. Even so, the UN and aid groups active in Gaza say Israel has not allowed in anything close to what they need. Hardened aid officials with long careers trying to help civilians in warzones have told me they have never seen anything as bad. One who has been inside Gaza multiple times in the last few months (journalists are not allowed in by Israel and Egypt, who control the borders) said he had ""never seen anything of this size, scale and depth"". Mr Blinken's top priority is securing a ceasefire in Gaza. President Biden needs to calm the Middle East, not just because of the terrible risks of a continued and escalating war, but because he faces elections this year. Polls suggest he is losing votes as some Americans blame his support for Israel for the humanitarian catastrophe inside Gaza. A renewed burst of diplomacy, involving the US, Qatar, Egypt and Israel, produced broad parameters for a deal but no details. Hamas has delivered its terms. It wants a three-stage process lasting 135 days, which would allow a phased exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. It has put forward a long list of demands. The most significant is that by the end of that time Israel would have pulled its forces out of Gaza and the war would be over. All that was dismissed by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after his meeting with Secretary of State Blinken. Since the war started, Israel has defined victory as the destruction of Hamas and the safe return home of the hostages. Neither objective has yet been achieved. Mr Netanyahu said Israel would not make concessions to Hamas, and repeated his insistence that its forces were closing in on ""total victory"". In recent days, he has also said Israel needed to kill Hamas leaders. Mr Blinken still believes, he said later, that a deal is possible. His challenge is to try to narrow the gap between the diametrically opposed positions of Israel and Hamas to get some sort of ceasefire. The BBC's information is that Hamas is much less confident than it was early in the war. The ferocity of Israel's assault and the killing of so many civilians means that Gazans trapped in the war are turning against Hamas, making its leaders realise they need to try negotiation. In Israel, for all the determined talk emerging from the prime minister and his allies, pressure is growing for a ceasefire to create an opportunity for a deal to get the hostages back. It is not much for Mr Blinken to work with. The odds look to be against a ceasefire unless either or both sides make substantial concessions.

Gaza ceasefire: Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu rejects Hamas's proposed termsPublished7 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected Hamas's proposed ceasefire terms - saying ""total victory"" in Gaza is possible within months. He was speaking after Hamas laid out a series of demands in response to an Israel-backed ceasefire proposal. Mr Netanyahu said negotiations with the group were ""not going anywhere"" and described their terms as ""bizarre"". Talks are continuing to try to reach some sort of deal. ""There is no other solution but a complete and final victory,"" Mr Netanyahu told a news conference on Wednesday. ""If Hamas will survive in Gaza, it's only a question of time until the next massacre."" Israel was expected to take issue with Hamas's counter-offer, but this response is a categorical rebuke, and Israeli officials clearly see an effort by Hamas to end the war on its terms as utterly unacceptable. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told the Reuters news agency that Mr Netanyahu's remarks ""are a form of political bravado"", and show he intends to pursue the conflict in the region. An Egyptian official source told the BBC that a new round of negotiations, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, is still expected to go ahead on Thursday in Cairo. Egypt has called on all parties to show the necessary flexibility to reach a calm agreement, the source said. And Mr Netanyahu's rejection of a ""delusional"" plan are in stark contrast to remarks from Qatar, which described Hamas's response as ""positive"". Hamas put forward itscounter-offer to a ceasefire proposalon Tuesday. A draft of the Hamas document seen by Reuters news agency listed these terms: The proposed deal would also see deliveries of food and other aid to Gaza increase. By the end of the 135-day pause in fighting, Hamas said negotiations to end the war would have concluded. Around 1,200 people were killed during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October last year. More than 27,700 Palestinians have been killed and at least 65,000 injured by the war launched by Israel in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Mr Netanyahu also confirmed on Wednesday that Israeli forces have been ordered to prepare to operate in the southern Gaza city of Rafah - where tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled in order to escape the fighting. Expanding the conflict into Rafah would ""exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare"" in the city, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned. ""We are afraid of the invasion of Rafah,"" one displaced person at the Rafah Crossing, near the border with Egypt, told BBC Arabic. ""We sleep in fear and sit with fear. There is no food, and the weather is cold."" The Israeli leader's comments are a blow to a sustained push by the US to reach a deal that its top diplomat, Antony Blinken, described as ""the best path forward"" - even though he cautioned there was ""still a lot of work to be done"". During a news conference on Wednesday, Mr Blinken said there were ""some clear non-starters"" in Hamas' counter-proposal. But, he added: ""We do think it creates space for an agreement to be reached, and we will work at that relentlessly till we get there."" Sharone Lifshitz, whose parents were among those kidnapped in southern Israel on 7 October and taken to Gaza, told the BBC's Newshour programme that Mr Netanyahu's rejection of the Hamas ceasefire terms was ""almost certainly a death sentence to more hostages"". Ms Lifshitz's 85-year-old mother, Yocheved, was subsequently released but her father, Oded, remains in captivity. ""My own father is 83, he's frail, he cannot last longer,"" she said. ""I don't know if the prime minister thinks about him, or if he already accounts for him as somebody who would return in a coffin."" Mr Netanyahu's stance also highlights the continuing, fundamental mismatch between the US and Israel's plans for Gaza's future. He is insisting on an entity where Israel maintains overall security control, and Gaza is run by local bodies with no connection to Hamas or any other group. Washington's vision of the future includes a horizon with a Palestinian state. The urgent question now is whether something can be salvaged to keep these talks going to achieve another exchange of hostages and prisoners, and a desperately needed humanitarian pause, to allow more aid into the Gaza Strip. Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200.

Israel-Gaza war: Hamas responds to ceasefire offer with 135-day truce planPublished7 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hamas has laid out a series of demands, including exchanging hostages for Palestinian prisoners and rebuilding Gaza, in response to an Israel-backed ceasefire proposal. The armed group wants a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and an end to the war after three 45-day truce periods. The offer is likely to be unacceptable to Israel's prime minister, who has called for ""total victory"" in Gaza. The question is whether a middle ground can be reached to move the process on. Hamas's response is a counteroffer to a ceasefire proposal backed by Israel and the US and mediated by Qatar and Egypt - details of which have not been made public. A draft of the Hamas document seen by the Reuters news agency suggests: The deal would also see deliveries of food and other aid to Gaza increase. By the end of the 135-day pause in fighting, Hamas says negotiations to end the war would have concluded. The proposal received a tepid response from US President Joe Biden, who called it ""a little over the top"". Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said there was still ""a lot of work to be done"" to reach a permanent ceasefire, but stressed the importance of reaching a lasting peace. A previous one-week truce in November saw about 100 hostages freed in a swap with 240 Palestinian prisoners. Around 1,200 people were killed during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October last year. More than 27,700 Palestinians have been killed and at least 65,000 injured by the war launched by Israel in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Speaking to Israel's Channel 13, a senior Israeli representative said some of the Hamas demands could not be met, adding that authorities were debating whether to reject the proposal or request different conditions. While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists the goal is ""total victory"", Israeli officials acknowledge that is still a long way off and some insist it is not even achievable militarily. Earlier, a senior Hamas official told the BBC the armed group had ""presented a positive vision"" to the Israel-backed proposal but had asked for some amendments relating to the rebuilding of Gaza and the return of its residents to their homes. The US, one of the main brokers in these indirect Israel-Hamas talks, still sees negotiations as the ""best path forward"" and is pressing hard along with its Arab partners. Their goal is to achieve a sustained humanitarian pause, which could lead to a ceasefire and provide breathing space to focus on a more ambitious plan for the ""day after"" the end of the war. Mr Blinken called it an ""incredibly powerful path"" which would pave the way to the rebuilding of Gaza, a reformed Palestinian Authority and eventually a Palestinian state, as well as a normalisation of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. But the Israeli military is still focused on destroying Hamas brigades and hunting down Hamas leaders. And Mr Netanyahu, ever mindful of his own political survival, is under pressure from right-wing allies who warn they'll bring down his government if he makes any concessions. Israeli families of hostages are growing ever more anxious about the fate of their loved ones, particularly following disclosures that a fifth of the more than 130 hostages remaining in Gaza are dead. The US and its Arab allies worry about the growing risks of a wider regional conflagration. And many international organisations are loudly warning of the deepening humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the Strip. Many clocks are ticking loudly.

"Time running out, British hostages' families warnPublished7 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The families of British hostages and those with British connections held by Hamas have said that if a deal is not reached to release the hostages soon, they may never come home. A delegation representing four families has met Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Qatari foreign affairs minister. Among them was Steve Brisley, from South Wales, who is campaigning to free his brother-in-law Eli Sharabi. ""Now is the time to secure the deal,"" he said. His Bristol-born sister Lianne Sharabi and his nieces Noiya, 16, and Yahel, 13, were murdered on 7 October when Hamas launched a series of cross-border attacks from the Gaza Strip on southern Israel. Eli's brother Yossi was also kidnapped but died in captivity three weeks ago. Mr Brisley said he was ""executed"" by Hamas, but the group hasclaimed he was killed in an Israeli airstrike. At a press conference in London, he described videos that Hamas released of Yossi before and after he was killed as ""taunting our family"". ""This is what failure looks like, failure of international diplomacy, failure to release the hostages,"" he said. Negotiations for a deal which would see hostages returned isbeing discussed by Israel and Hamas. Reports say Hamas is demanding the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and an end to the war. According to a draft seen by Reuters news agency, this would involve three truce phases with the first seeing all Israeli women hostages, males under 19, the elderly and sick exchanged for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. Remaining Israeli male hostages would be exchanged in the second phase. But the offer is likely to be unacceptable to Israel's prime minister, who has called for ""total victory"" in Gaza. Mr Brisley said: ""If this current deal doesn't bring the hostages home there is a very real chance they will never come home."" Sharone Lifschitz, a British citizen, saw her mother Yochoved released in October but her 83-year-old father Oded is still being held. ""Israel has a duty to return its citizens and Israel will have to make difficult choices,"" she said. ""In the past it has released many Palestinian prisoners and it will have to do that... I don't think it has a choice."" But she also pointed out that her mother had previously been released as a humanitarian gesture, and others should be released in the same way. ""Hamas doesn't need a deal to release hostages... nothing is stopping Hamas releasing people for humanitarian reasons,"" she said. In tears she said they were still living as if it was 7 October. ""With every day that passes the chances of all the hostages, the chances of my father, reduces,"" she said. Hamas is also holding British citizen Nadav Popplewell and another British citizen whose family have asked for privacy. The families described the London meeting with the prime minister and Qatari minister as encouraging. Mr Brisley said it was helpful to look them in the eyes ""so they are aware that it's about families, about people"". He said Mr Sunak had explained to them the hostages are always on his mind. The prime minister told them he carried a ""Bring them Home"" dog tag necklace he was given by the father of another hostage in his pocket and on his desk ""to remind him of the importance of hostages"", he said. On Tuesday, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) confirmed that 29 of the hostages kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have died. About a hundred are still being held. Sharon Sharabi, the other brother-in-law of Eli and Yossi Sharabi, said this terrible news showed this was now the time to act not talk. ""The time is running out. This is not a slogan,"" he said. ""You saw what happened to Yossi. We don't want all the hostages to come back in coffins or maybe not at all. ""We are doing everything to bring you back home."" About 1,200 people were killed during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October last year. The armed group is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, including the UK and US.

Macron leads ceremony for French victims of Hamas attacksPublished7 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"President Emmanuel Macron has described the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel as ""the largest antisemitic attack of our century"". He was addressing a ceremony for French victims of the attacks in the courtyard of the Invalides military complex in Paris. A total of 42 French and dual French-Israeli nationals were killed on 7 October, and six were injured. Three are still missing, presumed to have been taken hostage by Hamas. Four French hostages were freed during a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in November. The 7 October attack was the largest slaughter of French nationals since the July 2016 Bastille Day attack in the southern city of Nice, in which 86 peoplewere killed when a truck drove into crowdscelebrating Bastille Day. The sombre ceremony - the first of its kind to be held outside of Israel - took place in pouring rain. A French government representative said earlier this week that it was obvious that ""the same emotion and the same dignity are owed to the French victims of the bombing of Gaza, who will be honoured on another occasion"". Dozens of members of the Jewish community stood outside Les Invalides, following events on a giant screen and holding signs that read ""The world can never look away again"". Ahead of President Macron's speech, photographs of the 42 victims were brought out as their relatives looked on. Three chairs were left empty, to mark the three hostages believed still in captivity in Gaza. A violinist and a pianist gave a rendition of Maurice Ravel's interpretation of Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. ""On 7 October, at dawn, the unspeakable emerged from the depths of history... Hamas launched a massive and hateful attack, the largest antisemitic attack of our century,"" said the French president. He drew parallels between 7 October and the ""barbarity"" of the 2015-2018 jihadist attacks in Paris, Nice and Strasbourg. ""Barbarity feeds off antisemitism and spreads it,"" President Macron said. ""But those who kill out of hatred will always find on their path those who are ready to die for love."" French Jews have been targeted by a steep increase in attacks in the four months since 7 October, and President Macron hit out against ""rampant, uninhibited antisemitism"". His speech was followed by a minute of silence and the Marseillaise. A number of cabinet ministers and representatives of political parties attended the ceremony. Among those taking part were members of the far-left France Unbowed (LFI), whose leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has come under fire for not labelling Hamas a ""terrorist"" group. The armed group is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, including the UK, EU and US. LFI described Hamas as ""an armed offensive of Palestinian forces"", prompting fierce criticism from other parties, including left-wing allies such as the Socialist and Communist parties. A major demonstration against antisemitism in Paris in November was boycotted by LFI. Relatives of the victims and the hostages criticised the presence of LFI deputies at the Invalides. ""I don't think they should be there,"" Ishay Dan, the brother of French hostage Ofer Kalderon, told Agence France-Presse. Aymeric Caron, an MP who belongs to a party affiliated with LFI, was booed by the crowd outside Les Invalides who called him a ""collabo"" - a derogatory term for traitorous Nazi collaborators during World War Two. After the ceremony, Mr Mélenchon wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that his party colleagues who attended had shown great dignity and that, ""despite the swearing and the provocations"", they had paid their respects to the dead. France has a Jewish community of almost 500,000, the largest in Europe. Another 100,000, many of them dual nationals, live in Israel. Around 1,200 people were killed during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October last year. More than 27,500 Palestinians have been killed and at least 65,000 wounded by the war launched by Israel in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",2024-02-07T14:00:55.000Z

Syria says Israel bombed targets in Homs areaPublished7 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Syrian army says Israel has struck targets in Homs province, just north of Lebanon, killing or injuring a number of people. Syrian air defences shot down Israeli missiles, Syrian state media say. The attacks targeted Shuyrat air base and other sites near the city of Homs, a Syrian military source was reported as saying by Reuters news agency. Since the Gaza war broke out in October, Israeli attacks on Iranian-backed militia targets have escalated. A war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said four people had been killed in Tuesday evening's attacks. Syrian state television showed ambulances rushing to the scene of an air strike where rubble from a building could be seen, Reuters reports, adding that it could not verify the location. Two civilians are among the dead, the Syrian Observatory told AFP news agency. Israel has carried out military strikes in Syria for years, against what it says are Iran-linked targets. However, it rarely comments on individual strikes. Iranian forces have been present in Syria since the early stages of the Syrian civil war, where they helped support the government of President Bashar al-Assad against a widespread rebellion. Last week, the US bombed what it said were Iran-linked targets in Syria and Iraq in response to the killing of three US service personnel in Jordan on 28 January.",2024-02-07T00:28:55.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: Hamas responds to proposed Gaza ceasefire planPublished6 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hamas says it has given its response to a framework proposal for a new ceasefire in Gaza. The details of the deal - set out by Israel, the US, Qatar and Egypt - have not been released. It was earlier reported to include a six-week truce, when more Israeli hostages would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. Israel and the US have both said they are reviewing Hamas's response. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is currently in the Middle East, said he would discuss Hamas's response with officials in Israel on Wednesday. While Mr Blinken has given no indication of how the US views the response, President Joe Biden described it as ""a little over the top"" - suggesting the Israeli leadership will not easily agree to what the group is asking. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the group had presented a ""positive vision"" in response to the framework but had asked for some amendments relating to the rebuilding of Gaza, the return of its residents to their homes and the provisions for those who had been displaced. The official said Hamas had also asked for changes relating to the treatment of those injured, including their return home and transfer to hospitals abroad. The proposal was sent to Hamas around a week agobut a representative told the Reuters news agency it had taken them until Tuesday to respond because parts of it were ""unclear and ambiguous."" Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al Thani has described Hamas's response as ""positive"" in general. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 others taken hostage. More than 27,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the health ministry in the Gaza Strip, which has been governed by Hamas and blockaded by Israel and Egypt since 2007. During a week-long ceasefire in late November, 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The timing of any new deal could be complicated by claims briefed earlier this week by Israeli defence officials that the military is ""making progress"" in its hunt for Hamas's leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under intense domestic pressure to secure the release of the remaining hostages. A growing sense of regional crisis also adds to the urgency Mr Blinken brings to the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, as he arrives seeking progress on the deal. The US is increasingly trying to stem a widening regional escalation after last week's drone strike that killed three American soldiers in Jordan. Washington retaliated with air strikes against Iran-backed militias in Syria and Iraq and is warning more will come. A ceasefire deal in Gaza is seen by the US as the most realistic way to reduce tensions further afield. Hamas, which is also backed by Iran, is proscribed as a terrorist organisation in several countries. On Tuesday, Israel confirmed that 31 of the 136 remaining hostages in Gaza had been killed. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said their families had been informed and that the authorities would continue to push for the return of the remaining captives. ""This is a moral obligation, national obligation and international obligation and this is our compass and this is how we will continue operating,"" said Mr Hagari. Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.",2024-02-06T21:41:35.000Z

McDonald's sales dented by Israel-Gaza boycottsPublished5 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"McDonald's has missed a key sales target, partly due to customers boycotting the firm for its perceived support of Israel. The fast food chain reported its first quarterly sales miss in nearly four years due to weak growth in its international business division. Its boss previously acknowledged the impact of the conflict, blaming ""misinformation"". Shares in McDonald's fell about 4% after the announcement. McDonalds is one of several Western corporations including Starbucks and Coca Cola that have seen boycotts and protests against them by anti-Israeli campaigners. The firm said that the Israel-Gaza conflict had ""meaningfully impacted"" performance in some overseas markets in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the branch which includes sales in the Middle East, China and India, sales growth stood at  0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023 - far below market expectations. Its business in Malaysia, Indonesia and France have been affected, with the biggest impact felt in the Middle East, chief executive Chris Kempczinski said on Monday. ""So long as this war is going on... we're not expecting to see any significant improvement [in these markets],"" the McDonald's boss added. McDonald's relies on a franchise system in which thousands of independent businesses own and operate most of its more than 40,000 stores around the world. About 5% of its outlets are located in the Middle East. The fast food retailer drew criticism after its Israel-based franchise said it had given away thousands of free meals to members of the Israeli military, sparking calls to boycott the brand by those angered by Israel's military response in Gaza. It prompted franchise owners in Muslim-majority countries such as Kuwait, Malaysia and Pakistan to put out statements distancing themselves from the firm. Mr Kempczinski called the backlash ""disheartening and ill-founded,"" and blamed it on ""misinformation"". McDonald's global sales grew by just under 4% in the fourth quarter, down from 8.8% in the previous quarter, and below its annual average. The corporation benefitted from price inflation, recording its strongest sales growth in the United States, while also growing sales in the UK, Germany and Canada. But its US business saw weaker sales growth than hoped, as customers on lower incomes ordered less food and opted for cheaper items on the menu. Last week, Starbucks also cut its annual sales forecast, partly due to fewer customers visiting stores in the Middle East. McDonald's said on Monday that its thoughts were with the families and communities impacted by the conflict in the region. It said it would ""continue to stay focused on supporting our people and the local communities in which we operate"".",2024-02-05T17:38:09.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: Unknown fate of six-year-old Hind Rajab trapped under firePublished5 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The voice on the other end of the line was small and faint; a six-year-old's voice, crackling on a mobile phone from Gaza. ""The tank is next to me. It's moving."" Sitting in the emergency call-centre of the Palestinian Red Crescent, Rana tried to keep her own voice calm. ""Is it very close?"" ""Very, very,"" the small voice replied. ""Will you come and get me? I'm so scared."" There was nothing Rana could do except keep the conversation going. Six-year-old Hind Rajab was trapped under fire in Gaza City and begging for help, hiding inside her uncle's car, surrounded by the bodies of her relatives. Rana's voice was her only fragile link with a familiar world. Hind had set off from her home in Gaza City earlier that day with her uncle, aunt and five cousins. It was Monday 29 January. That morning, the Israeli army had told people to evacuate areas in the west of the city and move south along the coast road. Hind's mother, Wissam, remembers there was intense shelling in their area. ""We were terrified, and we wanted to escape,"" she said. ""We were fleeing from place to place, to avoid the air strikes."" The family decided to head for the Ahli Hospital to the east of the city, hoping it would be a safer place to shelter. Wissam and her older child began making their own way there on foot; Hind was given a place in her uncle's car, a black Kia Piccanto. ""It was very cold and rainy,"" Wissam explained. ""I told Hind to go in the car because I didn't want her to suffer in the rain."" As soon as the car left, she said, they heard loud shooting coming from the same direction. As Hind's uncle drove towards the city's famous al-Azhar University, the car is thought to have unexpectedly come face to face with Israeli tanks. They pulled into the nearby Fares petrol station for safety, and appear to have come under fire. Inside the vehicle, the family called relatives for help. One of them contacted the emergency headquarters of the Palestinian Red Crescent, 50 miles (80km) away in the occupied West Bank. It was now around 14:30 (12:30 GMT): operators at the Red Crescent call-centre in Ramallah called the mobile phone number for Hind's uncle, but his 15-year-old daughter, Layan, answered instead. In the recorded phone call, Layan tells the Red Crescent staff that her parents and siblings have all been killed, and that there is a tank next to the car. ""They are firing at us,"" she says, before the conversation ends with the sound of gunfire and screaming. When the Red Crescent team ring back, it is Hind who answers, her voice almost inaudible, drowned in fear. It soon becomes clear that she is the only survivor in the car, and that she is still in the line of fire. ""Hide under the seats,"" the team tell her. ""Don't let anyone see you."" Operator Rana Faqih stayed on the line with Hind for hours, as the Red Crescent appealed to the Israeli army to allow their ambulance to access the location. ""She was shaking, sad, appealing for help,"" Rana remembered. ""She told us [her relatives] were dead. But then later she described them as 'sleeping'.  So we told her 'let them sleep, we don't want to bother them'."" Hind kept asking, over and over again, for someone to come and get her. ""At one point, she told me it was getting dark,"" Rana told the BBC. ""She was scared. She asked me how far away my house was. I felt paralysed and helpless."" Three hours after the call began, an ambulance was finally despatched to rescue Hind. In the meantime, the Red Crescent team had reached Hind's mother, Wissam, and patched her phone line into the call. She cried more when she heard her mother's voice, Rana remembers. ""She pleaded with me not to hang up,"" Wissam told the BBC. ""I asked her where she was injured, then I distracted her by reading the Quran with her, and we prayed together. She was repeating every word I said after me."" It was after dark when the ambulance crew - Yousef and Ahmad - notified operators that they were nearing the location, and were about to be checked for entry by Israeli forces. It was the last operators heard from their colleagues - or from Hind. The line to both paramedics, and to the six-year-old girl they came to rescue, disconnected for good. Hind's grandfather, Bahaa Hamada, told the BBC that the girl's connection with her mother lasted a few moments longer, and that the last thing Wissam heard was the sound of the car door being opened, and Hind telling her that she could see the ambulance in the distance. ""Every second, my heart burns,"" Wissam told the BBC. ""Every time I hear the sound of an ambulance, I think, 'maybe it's her'. Every sound, every gunshot, every falling missile, every bomb - I wonder if it's heading for my daughter, if she's been hit."" Neither Red Crescent teams in Gaza, nor Hind's family, have been able to reach the location, which still lies inside an active combat zone controlled by the Israeli army. ""It's hard at night,"" the call operator Rana said, ""when you wake up and hear her voice in your ear, saying 'come and get me'"". We asked the Israeli army for details of its operations in the area that day, and about the disappearance of Hind and the ambulance sent to retrieve her. We asked again 24 hours later, and they said they were still checking. ""Where is the International Court of Justice? Why are presidents sitting in their chairs?"" Hind's mother, Wissam, asked. A week on from her daughter's disappearance, Wissam sits and waits at the Ahli hospital, day after day, filling the absence with a resolute hope that Hind will be brought back alive. ""I've brought her things, and I'm waiting for her here,"" she said. ""I'm waiting for my daughter any moment, any second. I'm begging from a broken mother's heart not to forget this story.""

What are routes out of this 'dangerous moment' in Middle East?Published3 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"As expected, Friday night's US strikes were carefully calibrated, going further than the US has gone in Iraq and Syria in recent months - but stopping short of directly attacking Iran, the power Washington says is behind much of the Middle East's recent instability. Is a wider conflagration in the region now more likely - or are there other ways out of what the US has described as this ""dangerous moment""? And is a ceasefire in Gaza one of those ways? First of all, let's look at what the Americans have actually done. The attacks were widespread - 85 targets at seven sites across Iraq and Syria - and designed to degrade the capabilities of pro-Iranian militias and their Iranian backers, the Quds Force (the expeditionary wing of Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC). Washington will do its own battle-damage assessment, but this is likely to be more about physical disruption than the number of fighters killed. By telegraphing its intentions over several days, Washington gave the Quds Force and its local allies time to get out of harm's way. Washington has made it clear it is not interested in a direct confrontation with Iran. Friday's action was all about preventing a repeat of the attack which killed three US service personnel in Jordan on 28 January. Nor were its actions confined to the purely military. It also imposed sanctions on companies allegedly involved in Iran's ballistic missile and drone programmes, as well as six officials from the IRGC's Cyber-Electronic Command. ""I think America has gone to great lengths to calibrate and attempt to reset deterrence in the region,"" the former commander of UK Joint Forces Command, Gen Sir Richard Barrons, told the BBC. Whether this works remains to be seen. Three days ago, the leader of Kataib Hezbollah, one of the leading Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, said it had suspended operations against US forces, a possible sign that Iran was already looking to avoid a further escalation. But now that the US has struck back, could Tehran's calculation change? ""The United States hasn't struck Iran, so there isn't anything for Iran to do,"" Prof Mohammad Marandi of Tehran University told the BBC on Saturday morning. While it's true that the Biden administration resisted the urge to target Iran directly, Tehran's calculations are not likely to be so black and white. It has also said that it is not interested in a war with America, but through its allies and proxies across the Middle East, from Hezbollah in Lebanon to the Houthis in Yemen, it has a range of options to choose from. Both sides are weighing up their next steps, with Joe Biden saying on Friday that the US response had only just begun. ""It will continue at times and places of our choosing,"" he said. But even as the two sides eye each other suspiciously, and calculate the benefits and costs of further escalation, diplomatic efforts are once again under way to try and address the conflict, whose tsunami-like waves have been crashing across the Middle East for the past four months - the war in Gaza. Biden's tireless Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, is about to embark on his fifth tour of the region since early October. Over the course of five days, he'll visit Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and the West Bank. Every trip so far has been about trying to put out the brush fires threatening to engulf the Middle East. Each time the Secretary of State returns to the region, there seems to be a new one. Mr Blinken's fire-fighting capabilities are being sorely tested. A brief summary of his agenda released by the State Department, points to the complex web of inter-connected issues he's grappling with. Hostages and humanitarian assistance in Gaza, freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, US personnel in the region and ""lasting security for Israelis and Palestinians alike"". It's a daunting list, but one which suggests that this is also a moment of opportunity. Last week, as trouble loomed atTower 22- the US base in Jordan where the three US soldiers were killed - reports from Paris suggested that a meeting of senior US, Egyptian, Israeli and Qatari officials had made progress towards arranging a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli and other hostages. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there were still ""significant gaps."" Mr Netanyahu himself seemed to pour cold water on the idea of a deal that could involve the release of thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli jails and the redeployment of Israeli forces outside the Gaza Strip. Most observers agree that such a deal - vehemently opposed by some of the prime minister's hard-line cabinet ministers - could bring down the Netanyahu government. Hamas officials are also thought to be divided. The Wall St Journal reports that the group's leaders inside Gaza are willing to accept an initial six-week pause in the fighting, but that leaders outside are pushing for a permanent ceasefire. As things stand, there is no deal, but negotiations haven't broken down either. Blinken may be hoping for signs of progress as he shuttles across the region. For a ceasefire in Gaza would almost certainly starve the region's brush fires of the gale force wind that's currently fuelling them. In Yemen, the Houthis have said that they will cease their attacks on maritime traffic if the war in Gaza comes to an end. In Lebanon, the Shiite militia Hezbollah would have little reason to keep up cross-border attacks into Israel in the event of a ceasefire in Gaza. There are hundreds of thousands of civilians, on both sides of the border, who would dearly like to return to homes in areas affected by the tit-for-tat exchanges of gunfire since October. And while attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria long predate the conflict in Gaza, the Gaza war has hugely inflamed tensions in both countries. On the face of it, a ceasefire in Gaza would appear to be in everyone's interest. Who wouldn't want to see Israeli hostages released, relief for the devastated Palestinian population in Gaza, a lengthy (and perhaps permanent) end to fighting there, as well as a significant reduction in regional tensions? If only it were that simple. Hamas and Israel both want to emerge from the Gaza war with something they can call a victory. Benjamin Netanyahu wants to stay in office. Iran and America have competing regional agendas. Hezbollah, the Houthis and the various pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and Syria all have their own local concerns. Blinken's shopping list may include the ambitious goal of achieving ""lasting security for Israel and the Palestinians"", but right now that feels like a remote prospect, tantalisingly visible through the smoke but impossibly distant. It all has to start with a ceasefire in Gaza. The US has done what it said it would do and warned that there may be more to come.",2024-02-03T14:45:06.000Z

Why did US wait to retaliate for drone attack on its troops?Published3 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Nearly a week after a drone strike in Jordan killed three US soldiers, retaliatory strikes against Iran-backed militiashave begun. The strikes had been expected for several days, and in the interim, the Biden administration began to face questions and criticism from Republicans about the timing and forcefulness of the US response. But foreign policy experts believed the approach allowed Iran to withdraw personnel, potentially avoiding a wider conflict between the US and Iran. ""This would allow them to degrade the capacity of these Iranian-backed militias to attack US forces, but not escalate,"" Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East, told the BBC. ""Although it is likely not going to be a deterrent to future attacks."" The ultimate benefit, he said, would be ""to avoid a direct war"" between the US and Iran. The US struck the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and affiliated militias in Iraq and Syria, at seven sites in total. Bombers hit 85 individual targets, according to US defence officials. ""Let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond,"" President Joe Biden said. US officials have blamed an Iranian-backed militia group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, for the Jordan attack. The organisation - an umbrella group of multiple militias - is believed to have been armed, funded and trained by Iran. Iran has denied any involvement in the drone strike, which also injured 41 US troops. Defence and security officials said that weather had made it difficult to retaliate sooner, with Friday presenting the best conditions for launching strikes. Though the White House and Pentagon also repeatedly said they were avoiding ""telegraphing"" operations in the days leading up to the strikes, experts believe they did just that - with the ultimate intention of avoiding a wider war with Iran. Arabian Gulf States Institute of Washington fellow Hussein Ibish, said the delay appeared to be the US signalling ""what they're not going to do, which is strike inside Iran"". Mr Mulroy told the BBC it is possible that the US allowed Iranian Revolutionary Guard personnel ""to leave the facilities that are going to be struck"". Experts noted the US must walk a fine line between deterring a country like Iran without igniting a greater conflict. ""Telegraphing"" the strikes could allow the US to adopt a ""Goldilocks"" approach to the operation that is ""not too hard and not too soft"", said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Washington DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. From the Biden administration's perspective, that approach ""would inflict pain on our adversaries so they stop attacking our forces, but not so much that they feel a need for a massive escalation, thereby avoiding a regional war"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Friday that Washington won't ""telegraph future operations"" but confirmed ""there will be additional response action taken in coming days"". However, Republicans in Congress have been quick to condemn Mr Biden's approach for being too lenient on Iran. Speaker Mike Johnson, the most powerful Republican in Congress, said after the attacks that ""public handwringing and excessive signalling undercuts our ability to put a decisive end to the barrage of attacks endured over the past few months"". In a post on X, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas called Mr Biden's response ""anaemic"" and claimed ""it has only emboldened the ayatollahs further."" ""Only further, more devastating attacks against Iranian forces will scare the ayatollahs,"" he wrote. Senator Markwayne Mullin invoked the more aggressive actions of past Republican presidents, Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, as a contrast to Mr Biden's plan of attack. ""Deterrence isn't delayed half-measures,"" he wrote on X. ""Deterrence is taking the head off the snake."" But Mr Ibish noted that the Biden administration may be trying to avoid domestic political pitfalls that would come with the US getting dragged into a more serious conflict. ""If they did strike in Iran, the Republican standard bearers like Donald Trump would denounce Biden for being a warmonger,"" he said. ""It's a political trap. Everybody gets that, so they're not going to fall into that trap.""",2024-02-03T02:04:24.000Z

What we know about US retaliatory strikes in Iraq and SyriaPublished3 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"US forces have bombed 85 targets in Iraq and Syria as retaliation for an attack that killed three US troops at a base in northern Jordan last month. According to US officials, the co-ordinated attack was against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) Quds Force and allied militia groups. US President Joe Biden said the US attacks ""will continue at times and places of our choosing"". Critics have argued that the strikes should have occurred earlier. A statement from US Central Command (Centcom) said the attack occurred at 16:00EST (21:00GMT) - which is about midnight local time in the region. Forces used numerous aircraft, including B-1 ""long-range bombers flown from [the] United States"" to hit a total of 85 targets at seven sites. More than 125 precision munitions were used, the statement said. US General Douglas Sims said the B-1 bombers ""flew a single nonstop route from the US"" and were able to ""gas and go"" while travelling in the air. He added that the US is ""pretty confident"" that the locations struck were ""pretty significant in degrading capability"". ""We will know better in terms of what [the assessment] looks like tomorrow,"" Gen Sims said. US officials have blamed an Iranian-backed militia group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, for the attack and say the one-way drone was Iranian-made and similar to the ones being supplied to Russia. The militant organisation - an umbrella group of multiple militias - is believed to have been armed, funded and trained by the IRGC. Seven locations were hit  - four in Syria and three in Iraq - over 30 minutes. The facilities struck included command and control operations and munition supply chain facilities of ""militia groups and their IRGC sponsors who facilitated attacks against US and coalition forces"", the Pentagon added. Also targeted were logistics hubs and drone storage units. According to reports by AFP news agency, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said at least 13 pro-Iran fighters were killed in eastern Syria. There were no strikes on Iranian soil and an Iranian warship in the Red Sea, thought to be involved in helping direct Houthi attacks on commercial shipping, was not targeted. In a statement issued by the White House, Mr Biden said his country ""does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world"". But, he warned, ""let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond"". The attacks came several hours after Mr Biden attended a repatriation ceremony for the remains of William Rivers, 46, Kennedy Sanders, 24, and Breonna Moffett, 23. More than 40 other service members were injured in the same drone attack, which struck Tower 22 - a US base in north-eastern Jordan. Republicans criticised the timing, saying that the wait was too long.  US officials have said any delay was due to cloudy weather obstructing targets. Florida Republican Congressman Byron Donalds, speaking to Fox News after the US attack, said ""these strikes should have occurred later on that same day when our service members were killed."" After the attack, White House National Security Spokesman John Kirby said the US has had no communications with Iran since 28 January - the day the drone attack occurred. Iran has denied any role in the Tower 22 attack. ""No threat will be left unanswered,"" Revolutionary Guards commander Major General Hossein Salami, who advises Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Wednesday, before the US retaliation began. His remarks came a day after Amir Saeed Iravani, Iran's ambassador to the UN, told Iranian journalists in New York that Tehran would ""decisively respond"" to any attack on the country, according to the state-run Irna news agency. Experts believe that the nearly-one week delay was intended to allow Iran to withdraw personnel, potentially avoiding a wider conflict. ""If you know you're a target, you simply disappear,"" one Iraqi official told BBC News. One possible response by Iran could resemble what occurred in the days after the US assassination of the IRGC general Qasem Soleimani. Five days after the assassination, Iran fired volleys of ballistic missiles at US bases in Syria, after giving the US several hours' notice.

Confronting the Houthis: How powerful are Yemen’s rebel rulers?Published3 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Houthis continue to confound some of the world's most powerful militaries. They are still firing missiles at any international shipping they consider linked to the US, UK or Israel, as well as some that isn't. They have already had a major impact on global trade, forcing ships to divert thousands of miles away. They seem undaunted by repeated US-led air strikes on their missile bases and they have vowed to retaliate against US and UK assets. So just who are the Houthis, how did they get so powerful and what happens now in the Red Sea? The Houthis are a minority group of Yemenis from the mountainous north-west of the country. They take their name from their movement's founder, Hussein Al-Houthi. They fought several wars against Yemen's strongman ruler in the early 2000s and then, after he was deposed by the Arab Spring protests, they marched down to the capital, Sana'a, and seized power in 2014. The previously deposed President Saleh, still bitter at being ousted, put his loyal Republican Guard at their disposal, enabling them to take over 80% of Yemen's population. The Houthis then promptly assassinated him. Since the Houthis seized power, Yemen, already the poorest Arab nation, has been torn apart by a catastrophic civil war. An estimated 150,000 people have been killed, along with millions made dependent on food aid. For seven years the Houthis survived a massive and ultimately fruitless coalition air campaign to oust them, led by the Saudis who were alarmed at the Houthis' links to their arch-rival, Iran. ""The Houthis embody a triumphant mindset, forged through a series of victories over two decades"", says Mohammed Al-Basha, a Middle East expert with the Virginia-based consultancy Navanti. ""Demonstrating resilience from 2015 to 2022, they effectively thwarted the Saudi-led coalition's attempt to reinstate the internationally recognised government in Sana'a."" From mid-November 2023 onwards, the Houthis have used their substantial arsenal of missiles and drones to target shipping passing close to the narrow, strategic chokepoint of the Bab Al-Mandeb Strait. Their stated aim was to attack any vessel with Israeli links, in support of Hamas, vowing to continue their attacks until Israel ends its own assault on Gaza. When US and British warships came to the defence of container vessels steaming past Yemen's Red Sea coast the Houthis directed their attacks on the warships, at one point losing three of their speedboats and 10 sailors in a one-sided engagement with the US Navy. Despite that loss, attacking the US Navy and Royal Navy, says Mohammed Al-Basha, ""underscores the Houthis' prevailing sense of triumph and fosters euphoric hubris within their ranks... leading some members of the group to perceive divine intervention and a historic alignment in their favour."" The Houthis - most of whom follow the Zaidi branch of Shia Islam in Sunni-majority Yemen - represent only around 15% of Yemenis yet they consider themselves the rightful rulers. So how do they differ from the rest of the population? ""They are generally more war-like, violent and cruel,"" says Edmund Fitton-Brown, who was UK ambassador to Yemen from 2015-17. ""I encountered astonishing instances of brutality in Aden and Taiz. The Houthis consider themselves an elite from an elite (the Zaidi sect). Some of their casual viciousness towards Sunni civilians in central and southern Yemen has been remarkable: a readiness to deploy snipers and kill non-combatants for fun."" There has long been a concerted effort, led by the UN, to end Yemen's civil war and the Saudis, who host the legitimate but ousted Yemeni government, have concluded a fragile truce with the Houthis. Edmund Fitton-Brown had some experience of dealing with them in negotiations. ""It was extremely challenging"", he says. ""They were difficult, hostile, capricious, prone to tantrums, late arrivals and walkouts. They insisted on VIP treatment and a ready supply of qat [a narcotic leaf chewed by many Yemenis]. During peace talks they drove their Kuwaiti hosts mad with frustration."" Since the Houthis began their attacks on shipping, and the US and UK responded with air strikes on their missile bases, there have been vast, government-sanctioned protests against the West in the capital. So how genuine are they? ""By opposing what many in the population of northern Yemen perceive as foreign forces, including the US, UK and the Saudi-led coalition, and directly confronting Israel in support of Gaza"" says Al-Basha, ""the Houthis have gained popularity."" He adds however, that present-day Yemen remains a divided nation, with anti-Houthi resistance persisting in pockets of north-eastern Yemen, Maarib, Taiz and the southern governates. It appears unlikely the Houthis could emerge victorious in a ""free and fair election"". As to the protests, Fitton-Brown says the Houthis bring out mobs on the street through fear. ""They call a demonstration, make it a holiday from work, make it clear that attendance is expected. Many of their personnel were recruited because they were unemployed and desperate to earn a wage. In areas outside their control they are loathed."" And meanwhile the missiles keep coming. The Houthis seem to have an almost inexhaustible supply of drones and other munitions to launch at shipping, much of it supplied by Iran with parts smuggled in at sea in small boats or across the desert border with Oman. Doubtfully with the Houthis capitulating. ""They won't want to lose face,"" says Fitton-Brown. ""But [if a ceasefire occurred in Gaza] they may seize an opportunity to declare victory, claiming that they have achieved their objectives. If Iran becomes concerned that Houthi actions are putting the Islamic Republic at risk they have enough influence to make the Houthis look for a way out."" So for now, the situation in the southern Red Sea is a standoff. The Houthis are not backing down under military pressure, despite seeing one after another of their missile launch sites destroyed by US-led air strikes. They clearly have plenty more in their arsenal and the indications are they are looking to raise the stakes by preparing surface-to-air missile sites with a view to shooting down a western warplane. The southern Red Sea and adjacent Gulf of Aden will remain a dangerous part of the world for the foreseeable future.",2024-02-03T00:10:15.000Z

US sanctions Iranian officials over cyber-attacks on water plantsPublished2 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The US has imposed sanctions on six officials in Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which it says are responsible for the cyber-attacks on American water plants late last year. This comes as the US prepares its response to the drone attack that killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday. The US has said an Iranian-backed militia group is responsible for that attack. ""The deliberate targeting of critical infrastructure by Iranian cyber actors is an unconscionable and dangerous act,"" said Brian Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, in the announcement. The sanctioned individuals are part of the IRGC's Cyber-Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), and include Hamid Reza Lashgarian, the head of the cyber organisation, and also a commander in the IRGC-Quds Force. The Quds Force is Iran's shadowy overseas operations arm, which the US accuses of being responsible for attacks in the Middle East. Mr Nelson added that ""the United States will not tolerate such actions and will use the full range of our tools and authorities to hold the perpetrators to account"". The US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) calls America's water systems that residents rely on to drink clean water'target-rich, cyber-poor'. ""It's why Cisa moves with such urgency,"" said the agency's executive assistant director for cyber-security, Eric Goldstein, in an interview with the BBC. He said there could be ""a hypothetical scenario where [the cyber-attacks] had life-safety impact and affected the potability of water"". Late last year, a group named Cyber Av3ngers affiliated with the IRGC targeted the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa, in western Pennsylvania, along with several other water systems. These facilities' use of technology manufactured by Unitronics, an Israeli company, made them unsuspecting targets. The cyber group posted an image on compromised screens with their digital calling card, and the words ""down with Israel"". ""If you told me to list 10 things that would go wrong with our water authority, this would not be on the list,"" Matthew Mottes, the chairman of the authority, told the BBC's US partner CBS. According to Cisa, thanks to a simple default password - like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 - the Iranian hackers were able to disable a monitor regulating water pressure, but plant managers were able to take over manually. It was considered a low-level hacking attempt, but federal officials are concerned that these attacks are not only ramping up but are also exposing how vulnerable America's water systems are. ""Many water utilities likely didn't know they were running a default password,"" said Mr Goldstein. Following the attacks, Pennsylvania Senators Bob Casey and John Fetterman, and Congressman Chris Deluzio sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland urging ""the Department of Justice to conduct a full investigation and hold those responsible accountable"". In a statement to the BBC, Mr  Deluzio's office said: ""No-one expects to be in the crosshairs of a war in the Middle East, but in this day and age, cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare can occur anywhere - and everyone has to be prepared."" Cisa has warned there are several countries that are exploiting this lack of cyber-security awareness. ""Iranians cyber actors continue to mature and invest in their capabilities. China is the pacing threat that the US faces in cyberspace; there is malicious Russian activity, but North Korea and Iran continue to invest in their capabilities,"" Mr Goldstein told the BBC,",2024-02-02T21:20:42.000Z

Western officials in protest over Israel Gaza policyPublished2 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"More than 800 serving officials in the US and Europe have signed a statement warning that their own governments' policies on the Israel-Gaza war could amount to ""grave violations of international law"". The ""transatlantic statement"", a copy of which was passed to the BBC, says their administrations risk being complicit in ""one of the worst human catastrophes of this century"" but that their expert advice has been sidelined. It is the latest sign of significant levels of dissent within the governments of some of Israel's key Western allies. One signatory to the statement, a US government official with more than 25 years' national security experience, told the BBC of the ""continued dismissal"" of their concerns. ""The voices of those who understand the region and the dynamics were not listened to,"" said the official. ""What's really different here is we're not failing to prevent something, we're actively complicit. That is fundamentally different from any other situation I can recall,"" added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The statement is signed by civil servants from the US, the EU and 11 European countries including the UK, France and Germany. It says Israel has shown ""no boundaries"" in its military operations in Gaza, ""which has resulted in tens of thousands of preventable civilian deaths; and… the deliberate blocking of aid… putting thousands of civilians at risk of starvation and slow death."" ""There is a plausible risk that our governments' policies are contributing to grave violations of international law, war crimes and even ethnic cleansing or genocide,"" it said. The identities of those who signed or endorsed the statement have not been made public and the BBC has not seen a list of names, but understands that nearly half are officials who each have at least a decade of experience in government. One retired US ambassador told the BBC that the coordination by dissenting civil servants in multiple governments was unprecedented. ""It's unique in my experience watching foreign policy in the last 40 years,"" said Robert Ford, a former American ambassador to Algeria and Syria. He likened it to concerns within the US administration in 2003 over faulty intelligence leading up to the invasion of Iraq, but said this time many officials with reservations did not want to remain silent. ""[Then there were] people who knew better, who knew that intelligence was being cherry-picked, who knew that there wasn't a plan for the day after, but nobody said anything publicly. And that turned out to be a serious problem,"" he said. ""The problems with the Gaza war are so serious and the implications are so serious that they feel compelled to go public,"" he said. The officials argue the current nature of their governments' military, political or diplomatic support for Israel ""without real conditions or accountability"" not only risks further Palestinian deaths, but also endangers the lives of hostages held by Hamas, as well as Israel's own security and regional stability. ""Israel's military operations have disregarded all important counterterrorism expertise gained since 9/11… the [military] operation has not contributed to Israel's goal of defeating Hamas and has instead strengthened the appeal of Hamas, Hezbollah and other negative actors"". The officials say they have expressed their professional concerns internally but have been ""overruled by political and ideological considerations"". One senior British official who has endorsed the statement told the BBC of ""growing disquiet"" among civil servants. The official referred to the fallout from last week's preliminary ruling by the UN's International Court of Justice in a case brought by South Africa which required Israel to do all it can to prevent acts of genocide. ""The dismissal of South Africa's case as 'unhelpful' by our Foreign Secretary puts [the international rules-based] order in peril."" ""We have heard ministers dismiss allegations against the Israeli Government seemingly without having received proper and well-evidenced legal advice. Our current approach does not appear to be in the best interests of the UK, the region or the global order,"" said the official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. In response to the statement, the UK Foreign Office said it wanted to see an end to the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible. ""As the Foreign Secretary says, Israel has committed to act within international humanitarian law and has the ability to do so, but we are also deeply concerned about the impact on the civilian population in Gaza,"" said a spokesperson. The European Union Commission said it was ""looking into"" the statement. The US State Department has been approached for comment. The statement suggests that while Israel's military operation has caused unprecedented destruction of lives and property in Gaza, there appears to be no workable strategy to effectively remove Hamas as a threat, nor for a political solution to ensure Israel's security in the longer term. It calls for the US and European governments to ""stop asserting to the public that there is a strategic and defensible rationale behind the Israeli operation"". Israeli officials have consistently rejected such criticism. In response to the new statement, the Israeli embassy in London said it was bound by international law. It added: ""Israel continues to act against a genocidal terrorist organisation which commits war crimes as well as crimes against humanity."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed that only full military pressure on Hamas will secure the further release of hostages, while the army says it has destroyed significant underground infrastructure used by the group, including command centres, weapons sites and facilities for holding hostages. On Saturday, the Israeli military said: ""Throughout [the city of] Khan Yunis, we have eliminated over 2,000 terrorists above and below ground."" Israel has repeatedly rejected claims it deliberately targets civilians, accusing Hamas of hiding in and around civilian infrastructure. Since the start of the war, more than 26,750 Palestinians have been killed and at least 65,000 injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip, which has been governed by the group and blockaded by Israel and Egypt since 2007. Israeli officials say that 9,000 of those killed were Hamas militants but have not provided evidence for the figure. More than 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas attacks of October 7th, and a further 100 died of their injuries according to Israeli officials. More than 250 people were taken as hostages into Gaza. The US administration has repeatedly said that ""far too many Palestinians have been killed"" in Gaza, and that Israel has the right to ensure October 7th ""can never happen again"".",2024-02-02T12:56:13.000Z

Hostages freed after being held for nine hours at P&G plant in TurkeyPublished2 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Seven workers seized at a Proctor & Gamble (P&G) plant outside the Turkish city of Istanbul were rescued after a nine-hour ordeal, officials say. Police in Gebze moved in after the suspect, who was apparently protesting at the war in Gaza, went to the toilet. Local governor Seddar Yavuz said the hostages had suffered no injuries. Images online showed the suspect, his face hidden by a Palestinian scarf, wearing what appeared to be an explosives vest and carrying a gun. He was detained unharmed after the ""meticulous"" rescue operation, Mr Yavuz added. The hostage-taker entered the plant at about 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT), DHA news agency reports. The hostages were released shortly before midnight. Officials say the suspect wanted to draw attention to the ongoing situation in Gaza. A Palestinian flag was reportedly painted at the entrance of the building with a sign saying ""doors will be open for Gaza"". Police officers cordoned off access to the factory and medical staff were dispatched to the scene. Officials say a large-scale investigation into the incident is under way. Footage from the scene during the standoff showed relatives of some hostages clustered together at a police cordon some distance from the plant. İsmet Zihni, whose wife works at the plant, told DHA she had sent him a message saying she had been taken hostage. However, he added he did not know ""if it was her or someone else"". Relatives of the hostages had expressed frustration at the lack of information from Turkish officials or the police. ""We have been waiting for six hours without any official making a statement,"" the father of one hostage told AFP earlier. In a statement, P&G said it was relieved no-one was harmed during the incident. ""We are grateful to the authorities and first responders who managed the situation with courage and professionalism,"" the company added. It also said the suspect was not an employee.",2024-02-02T00:30:18.000Z

"US approves plan to strike Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials sayPublished2 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The US has approved plans for a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials have told the BBC's US partner CBS News. The strikes will take place over a number of days, officials said, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched. It comes after a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday. The US blamed an Iranian-backed militia group for that attack. That group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards force. It has said it was responsible for Sunday's strike. Iran, meanwhile, has denied any role in the attack which injured 41 other US troops at the military base, known as Tower 22. US officials have said that US intelligence believes that the drone used to attack the facility was manufactured by Iran - and is similar to the drones Iran has been sending to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. At a news conference on Thursday, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the delayed military response, saying: ""We will respond where we choose, when we choose and how we choose."" ""I think everyone recognises the challenge associated with making sure that we hold the right people accountable,"" he said, adding that there is no ""set formula for doing this"". ""There are ways to manage this so it doesn't spiral out of control. And that's been our focus throughout,"" Mr Austin continued. The officials who spoke to CBS News did not give an exact timeline on the potential strikes. They said the US military could launch them in bad weather, but preferred to have better visibility to reduce the risk of inadvertently hitting civilians. President Joe Biden has been under mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers, including some of Washington's most hawkish voices on Iran, to strike targets on Iranian soil. But while the US has repeatedly pledged to respond to the drone attack, Mr Biden and other defence officials have said Washington is not seeking a wider war with Iran or an escalation of tensions in the region. ""That's not what I'm looking for,"" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House earlier this week. The reportedly approved plans appear to keep the targeting to Iranian targets Syria and Iraq, rather than inside Iran. Several Iran-backed groups have increased attacks on US and Israeli-linked entities since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October. The Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, for example, have attacked ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, prompting strikes from the US and its allies. A US defence official told CBS that a drone was shot down overnight in the Gulf of Aden, while an unmanned sea drone was struck and destroyed in the Red Sea. Citing unnamed sources, Reuters on Thursday reported that Iran had withdrawn senior officials from Syria following a series of Israeli airstrikes in a bid to avoid being directly drawn into a wider conflict in the region. US officials told CNN this week that there were signs that the Iranian government was becoming increasingly concerned about the actions of its proxy groups in the region, who have launched over 160 attacks on US forces since October. The bodies of the three US soldiers killed in the attack in Jordan are expected to be repatriated to a Delaware Air Force base on Friday. The White House has announced that President Biden will attend. The three soldiers have been named as William Jerome Rivers, 46, Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23. All three were part of an army reserve unit based in Fort Moore, Georgia.",2024-02-02T00:06:57.000Z

US sanctions Israeli settlers over West Bank violencePublished1 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"US President Joe Biden has approved sanctions on four Israeli settlers accused of attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Mr Biden signed a broad executive order, saying violence in the West Bank had reached ""intolerable levels"". The sanctions block the individuals from accessing all US property, assets and the American financial system. Violence in the West Bank has spiked since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October. Some 370 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since then,according to the UN.The majority of those have been killed by Israeli forces but at least eight of them have been killed by Israeli settlers, the UN said. The new executive order means the US government has the power to sanction any foreign nationals who attack, intimidate or seize the property of Palestinians. The sanctions are a first by the US administration - a rare step targeting Israelis - and comes as Mr Biden travels to the state of Michigan, which hasa large Arab-American population that has been criticalof his support for Israel. The Arab American Institute, an advocacy group, earlier said that since the start of the conflict, support by Arab Americans for the Democratic Party has plummeted from 59% in 2020 to just 17%. On Thursday, a senior official in the Biden administration said the president had repeatedly raised concerns with Israel about violence by settlers. The executive ordersets out the groundwork for how the US will respond to further attacks in the West Bank, and is an escalation compared to the visa restrictions it imposed on some individuals last year. ""The situation in the West Bank - in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction - has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security and stability"" of the region, Mr Biden said in a letter to Congress explaining his reasoning. A senior administration official said the initial round of sanctions - targeting four people - were against ""individuals that have directly perpetrated violence and those who have engaged in repeated acts of intimidation, property destruction, leading to the forced displacement of Palestinian communities"". They said one person initiated and led a riot that led to the death of a Palestinian civilian in the town of Huwara, while another had attacked people with stones and clubs. They added that the executive order was ""non-discriminatory"" and applied to both Israelis and Palestinians who direct or take part in violent acts or threats against civilians, intimidation, destroying, seizing property or terrorism. The US Treasury named the four sanctioned Israelis as David Chai Chasdai, 29; Yinon Levi 31; Einan Tanjil, 21; and Shalom Zicherman 32. Three of them lived in West Bank settlements and one lived near the occupied region's border, the Treasury said. These US sanctions cannot be applied to American citizens, some of whom are thought to be involved in the violence. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the US does believes the sanctions ""will have an impact on these four individuals"" and expects Israel to ""do more to hold accountable those responsible for settler violence"". Shortly after Mr Biden signed the executive order, Israel signalled its dissatisfaction and described the majority of West Bank settlers as ""law-abiding"". ""Israel takes action against all law-breakers everywhere, and therefore there is no need for unusual measures on the issue,"" a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said. The response was yet another sign of a deepening public rift between the US and Israel. The two leaders are long-term allies, but have disagreed in recent weeks about the idea of creating an independent Palestinian state. The US believes a Palestinian state alongside Israel - known as a ""two-state solution"" - is vital for long-term stability in the region. Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea, and the White House acknowledged last month that the US and Israeli governments ""clearly see things differently"". Those comments dampened hopes in some circles that the conflict could result in Israeli and Palestinian leaders restarting diplomatic negotiations and kickstarting the dormant peace process.",2024-02-01T22:48:07.000Z

US and UK strikes fail to slow Houthi attacksPublished1 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Repeated US and UK air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen have failed to slow their attacks on ships in the region, BBC Verify has found. There have been nine attacks on ships in the past three weeks, compared with six in the previous three weeks. Since the US-led strikes began on 11 January, shipping using the vital Red Sea trade route has dropped by 29%. That's a greater rate of decline than between the start of Houthi attacks in November and the beginning of the US-led action. The Houthis initially said they were attacking ships connected to Israel, or heading to or from there. But since air strikes began in January they have mostly targeted ships tied to owners or operators in the UK or US. In total, 28 vessels have been targeted since Houthi attacks began in November. We've identified seven of these with links to Israeli companies, individuals or destinations. BBC Verify has used vessel tracking data and official company records to establish these ownership links where possible. However, identifying vessel affiliation is not a straightforward process as multiple layers of company ownership can be difficult to penetrate. Of the nine ships attacked since the air strikes began, five had American or British links, and none had identifiable Israeli links. As well as their targets, their tactics have changed. In November and December, their attacks were concentrated at the southern end of the Red Sea close to the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait where ships are forced to sail very close to the coast of Houthi-controlled Yemeni territory. In recent weeks they have been mainly striking further to the south in the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis have also changed how they attack. Initially they used both missiles and drones carrying explosives, but more recent attacks have used mainly missiles launched from Yemen. The Red Sea is a key shipping lane, and the most efficient way to transport goods between Asia and Europe. But the number of commercial ships using the route has fallen by 50% since the start of the Houthi attacks, according to ship tracking firm Lloyd's List Intelligence. This is despite a US-led military partnership, involving UK naval vessels, safeguarding commercial shipping in the area. It does not seem that the fall-off was seasonal as there was no similar pattern of decline in the same period last year. How did the decline come about? There was no perceptible initial response from shipping companies to the hijacking of the Galaxy Leader on 19 November. But ship tracking data shows that this changed from 15 December, when ship operators began taking decisions to re-route their cargo around Africa. The decline in ships using the Red Sea has continued in the weeks since, despite significantly more fuel being needed for the alternative route, as well as higher crew wages and insurance costs. As an example, the cost of transporting a standard 40ft container from Shanghai to Rotterdam has risen from about $1,200 (£940) in mid-November to almost $5,000 at the end of January. As freight charges rise, there will inevitably be pressure on the prices of all manner of consumer goods from fuel to food. Sailing from the Middle East to Europe around Africa, instead of through the Suez Canal, can add three weeks to the journey time and cost over $2m more, according to price reporting firm Argus Media. This map, based on data from the maritime AI company Windward, shows significantly higher traffic around Africa in January 2024 compared with the same period last year. With fewer ships passing through the Suez Canal, the canal's governing body says its revenues in January have dropped by 44% compared with the same month in 2023. It's also anticipating revenues to decline by 40% this year to $6bn on the assumption that the shipping crisis in the region will continue. Data from Lloyd's List Intelligence indicates that this is particularly true of certain vessel types such as container ships - where a small number of companies, like Maersk, control large portions of the global tally of ships. The number of oil tankers using the Suez Canal had almost doubled over the past two years, as sanctions against Russian energy forced European countries to source oil and gas from Asia. That has fallen since the Houthi attacks started, though not as dramatically as for container shipping. Ship operators choosing to risk the dangers of the Red Sea route have adopted various measures to reduce the possibility of attack. Some companies are paying for armed security teams on board their vessels to repel any hijacking attempts. Others have disabled their on-board AIS tracking - the system all commercial shipping uses to allow their position and declared route to be monitored - making it harder for Houthi forces to locate them. Some have taken to declaring ""no link to Israel"" on their location equipment, or have written ""armed guards on board"" or ""all Chinese crew"" - underscoring what ship owners believe will deter attackers. Some Chinese companies have capitalised on assurances of safe passage by the Houthis, and Lloyd's List Intelligence says that the proportion of Chinese-affiliated shipping has increased since the end of November from 13% to 28% of all vessels passing through the Red Sea.

Doctors train in Bolton to save lives in the Israel-Gaza warPublished1 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Doctors heading to the frontline of the Israel-Gaza war are learning the skills needed to save lives in a war-zone in the north-west of England. Dr Israar Haq from Birmingham has been training with other surgeons at Bolton University to treat everything from gunshot wounds to blast injuries. The war-zone surgery course is run by a charity started by renownedWelsh war surgeon Dr David Nott. Dr Haq said he felt compelled to help those suffering in the war. ""If you have any grain of humanity in your heart you want to help,"" he toldBBC Radio Manchester. ""Whether it's to just move some rubble out of the way so that the ambulances can get there, or whether it's to actually go in and physically help with operations and anaesthetics."" He is one of 38 surgeons and anaesthetists from across Europe who gathered at a classroom in Bolton University to learn how to treat a range of injuries while working under the pressures of a war-zone. More than 26,700 people have been killed in Gaza by the conflict triggered by the 7 October Hamas attack, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Volunteer trainers from the David Nott Foundation have been using their hostile environment surgical training dummy, known as Heston, to show how common war wounds can be managed. The charity's chief operating officer, Tim Law, said the job of the course was to ""prepare them to deal with the really traumatic experiences they will come across"". Rebekka Troller, a consultant who works with the charity, said the aim was to give the doctors the skills to ""do damage control, save lives, be the first response, and stabilise a patient before they can be transferred"". The trainer, who has recent experience working in conflict zones in Cameroon, said medics in war zones needed to prepare for ""all sorts of situations"". ""It's always a bit tense, usually the locals are really amazing, they're really helpful, and you work with a team, so you're not on your own, but you have to work under pressure."" Each of the doctors has made their own plans to volunteer in Palestine through organisations such as Medecins Sans Frontieres. Hirron Fernando, a doctor from Glasgow, said: ""We are living in a volatile world, these skills will help all who need them, and we are here all for humanity."" The doctor said he knew of colleagues who went to Gaza and were killed helping others. ""That's the price we have to pay, but I am willing to pay that price.""

Houthi Red Sea attacks: Group claims to have hit US container shipPublished1 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Houthi movement in Yemen says it has struck a US merchant ship it named as KOI in the Red Sea in a fresh attack targeting commercial shipping. But two maritime sources told BBC Verify that the Houthi claim was fake. US and UK authorities are yet to say whether an attack took place. Security firm Ambrey said a ship located south of Yemen reported a blast on its starboard but did not name it. Meanwhile, the US launched new air strikes in Yemen. Ten drones reportedly being set up to launch were targeted in the strike. According to Reuters news agency, the KOI is a Liberian-flagged container ship operated by UK-based Oceonix Services. The same company's fleet includes the oil tanker Marlin Luanda, which wasdamaged by a missile on Saturday. The Houthis regard all Israeli, US and British ships as legitimate targets following Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza, and have denounced US and British targeting of Houthi missile positions in what the two countries say are efforts to protect commerce. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Sarea said on Wednesday that the movement's armed forces had targeted an American merchant ship named KOI with ""several appropriate naval missiles"". The ship, he said, had been heading to ""the ports of occupied Palestine"", a phrase which is sometimes used to mean Israel. However industry publication Trade Winds said that the claim was ""fake"" and that in fact a sick crew member had been taken off the ship in a medical evacuation. Two maritime security sources supported this assessment. There has also been no word from UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which normally sends alerts when such attacks are carried out. But Mr Sarea reiterated that the Houthis would ""not hesitate"" to retaliate against ""British-American escalation"". ""All American and British ships in the Red and Arabian Seas are legitimate targets for the Yemeni Armed Forces as long as the American-British aggression against our country continues,"" the Houthi spokesman said. Troubled Waters: War in the Red Sea? Frank Gardner explains who the Houthis are and what they want. Available now on BBC iPlayer US Central Command said the 10 drones being prepared for launch in Yemen had posed a threat to merchant vessels and US warships in the region. All 10 were destroyed along with a Houthi drone ground control station, it said. The US added that one of its warships had shot down three Iranian drones and a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile in the Gulf of Aden. Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have slowed down international trade, raising fears of supply bottlenecks. On 7 October, hundreds of Palestinian gunmen from Gaza infiltrated southern Israel, where they killed around 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 26,900 people - most of them women and children - have been killed, according to the health ministry there which is controlled by the Hamas group. Additional reporting by Josh Cheetham, BBC Verify Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200.

White House blames Iran-backed umbrella group for deadly drone strikePublished1 FebruaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The White House has blamed an Iran-backed militia umbrella group for a deadly attack on a US base in Jordan, as it considers how to hit back. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said US intelligence believed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq was behind Sunday's drone strike. President Joe Biden has said without elaborating that he has already decided what the US response will be. The strike killed three US soldiers and injured at least 40 other US troops. The ""attribution that our intelligence community is comfortable with is that this was done by the umbrella group"", said Mr Kirby in a daily press briefing on Wednesday. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq - which is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards force - has already claimed responsibility for the strike. The national security spokesman repeated that the US response would be ""in a time and in a manner of our choosing, on our schedule"". ""Just because you haven't seen anything in the last 48 hours, it doesn't mean that you're not going to see anything,"" he said. ""The first thing you see won't be the last thing,"" he added. Mr Biden has said he does not want a wider conflict in the Middle East, which has already been destabilised by the Israel-Gaza war that erupted in October. Iran has denied any role in the drone attack. At an event on Wednesday, Revolutionary Guards commander Major General Hossein Salami, who advises Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that Tehran hears the ""threats coming from American officials"". ""No threat will be left unanswered,"" he added. His remarks came a day after Amir Saeed Iravani, Iran's ambassador to the UN, told Iranian journalists in New York that Tehran would ""decisively respond"" to any attack on the country, according to the state-run Irna news agency. While Washington weighs its response, Kataib Hezbollah, part of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, said on Tuesday it had suspended operations against US forces to avoid causing ""embarrassment"" to the Iraqi government. Three American soldiers who were based at Fort Moore, in the US state of Georgia, died in the drone strike in north-eastern Jordan. At least 41 National Guard members were injured, US officials confirmed on Wednesday. The injured soldiers are from units based in Arizona, California, Kentucky and New York. Twenty-seven were able to return to duty while 14 others continue to be medically evaluated, the US National Guard Bureau said. Meanwhile, the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen have continued to carry out missile and drone attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea in response to the war in Gaza. A ship in the Gulf of Aden was struck by a missile fired from the Taiz region, according to Ambrey, a maritime security firm. A spokesman for the Houthis confirmed the attack. US Central Command, which oversees US military actions in the Middle East, said that the USS Carney shot down one Houthi-fired missile headed towards the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday night. The US naval destroyer also ""engaged and shot down"" three Iranian drones ""in its vicinity"". Officials also said US fighter jets destroyed 10 drones in Yemen that were preparing to be launched. According to the Pentagon, the Houthis have launched more than 30 attacks on commercial ships since 19 November. The ongoing attacks have disrupted global trade and triggered retaliatory strikes from both American and British forces.",2024-02-01T03:00:28.000Z

Israelis tell British MPs of evidence of Hamas sexual violencePublished31 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israelis who dealt with the bodies of victims of Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel have told British MPs and peers that there was ""deliberate, systematic genital mutilation"" of female victims and that there was ""no question"" that some had been sexually assaulted. Business Secretary and Minister for Women Kemi Badenoch said all the reports must be fully investigated and sexual violence must be condemned. ""Rape is not resistance,"" she stated. Hamas has denied its gunmen sexually assaulted women during the attacks. But a senior Israeli police officer said her force had ""clear evidence"" that rape and other acts of sexual violence had been committed on a scale large enough to define it as a crime against humanity. Warning: Readers may find some of the details below distressing. On 7 October, hundreds of Palestinian gunmen from Gaza infiltrated southern Israel, where they killed around 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 26,900 people - most of them women and children - have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Many of the MPs and members of the House of Lords who attended Wednesday's meeting in Parliament were in tears as they listened to the testimony of the Israelis. Shari Mendes, an architect, was called up as a reservist by the Israeli military to help medics identify female bodies brought to the Shura army base after 7 October. ""Many women arrived with bloody, shredded underwear, many arrived with no clothing,"" she said. ""Our team commander saw several female soldiers who were shot in the vagina, the crotch or they were shot in the breast. This was gratuitous. This was a deliberate, systematic, genital mutilation."" Ms Mendes said her identification unit had seen bodies decapitated or with limbs cut off. ""I'm here to be their voice,"" she said. Simcha Greiniman was a volunteer for Zaka, an Israeli religious organisation that collects remains of the dead for burial. He told the BBC he had recovered many bodies after the Hamas attack. ""In one of the houses there was a woman separated from her family. She was in her bedroom leaning on her bed,"" he recalled. ""She was half naked from the waist down. She was shot in the back of her head... She had a live grenade in her hand."" He described finding another woman who had ""nails and different objects in her body, in women's personal places"", adding: ""It's something you can't imagine."" Mr Greiniman was clear that some of the victims he had seen had been sexually attacked. ""For sure, for sure, there's no question,"" he said. ""I'm the person that dealt with it. I'm the eyes."" ""I'm here to say, 'Yes, this is what happened,' and to show the world. We are telling the truth and the world has to understand and do something with it."" His plea to the international community was to understand that it had happened and not push it away, and to put those in charge behind bars. ""They have to pay for what they did,"" he said. Neither Ms Mendes nor Mr Greiniman are experts on sexual violence, but their testimony is in line with the evidence that the Israeli government says has been collected from forensic investigations as well as from hundreds of statements by witnesses and first responders. Chief Superintendent Mirit Ben Mayor of the Israel Police told the Parliamentarians that it had not been easy to collect evidence because of the many different locations and because people had been murdered. But she said: ""There is clear evidence that rape and sexual violence offences were committed against the victims. We are investigating crimes against humanity."" The BBC has also seen and heardevidence that women were raped and mutilated. It includes video testimony from an eyewitness at the Nova music festival, videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas gunmen, and photographs of bodies taken at the scenes of a number of attacks. The cousin of 19-year-old female hostage Agam Berger told the meeting that they had to bring home the more than 100 Israelis and foreign nationals believed to still be held captive in Gaza. Ashley Waxman Bakshi said she did not even know if her cousin wanted to stay alive after being held for so long. ""You can clearly understand our worry with every minute that passes when our women and girls are in the hands of these monsters, if they were able to do this in eight hours or 12 hours on 7 October,"" she said. ""They have been there for 117 days. What if they are pregnant?"" Kemi Badenoch said the UK stood in solidarity with all the victims. She also called on international organisations to do more to be clear in their condemnation of sexual violence against Israelis, saying there must not be double standards. Israeli officials and activists have complained that leaders of the UN and other international organisations have been slow to respond to the allegations. On Monday, the UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, arrived in Israel on a visit to ""give voice to survivors, witnesses, recently released hostages and those affected; to identify avenues for support, including justice and accountability; and to gather, analyse and verify information"". In a message to victims, their families and witnesses published by the Israeli presidency, Ms Patten said: ""Please come forward, please break your silence, because your silence will be the licence of those perpetrators."" ""We really want to ensure that [victims] have justice so that we put an end to this heinous act,"" she added. Two UN human rights experts said earlier this month that thereported acts of sexual violence constituted ""gross violations of international law, amounting to war crimes which, given the number of victims and the extensive premeditation and planning of the attacks, may also qualify as crimes against humanity"". Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200.

Kataib Hezbollah: Iran-backed group suspends attacks against US after drone strikePublished31 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An Iran-backed Iraqi militia suspected of a drone strike in Jordan that killed three US soldiers says it has suspended operations against US forces. Kataib Hezbollah, which is part of an umbrella group that claimed Sunday's attack, said this was ""to prevent embarrassment of the Iraqi government"". The US defence department said: ""Actions speak louder than words."" US President Joe Biden meanwhile said he had decided how to respond to the attack but did not elaborate. Iran warned it would retaliate against any attack on its ""interests"". Earlier,it denied US and British accusations that it was involved in the attack. The US has hinted at an armed response that might come in several waves. Kataib Hezbollah Secretary-General Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi said in a statement on Tuesday: ""As we announce the suspension of military and security operations against the occupation forces - in order to prevent embarrassment of the Iraqi government - we will continue to defend our people in Gaza in other ways."" The three US soldiers were killed at a base next to the Jordanian-Syrian border by a ""type of Shahed drone"", the one-way attack drones Iran has been providing to Russia, a US official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Dozens more soldiers were injured in the attack on Tower 22, which was struck while US forces were asleep in their bunks. The US has blamed Iran-backed groups and has not yet conclusively determined that Kataib Hezbollah was behind it. However, a Pentagon spokeswoman said it carried ""the footprints"" of the group. ""Actions speak louder than words,"" Pat Ryder told reporters after the group released its statement. ""There will be consequences,"" he added. Meanwhile, the US is taking steps to bolster security at Tower 22, where some 350 US soldiers are stationed in a mission focused on defeating the Islamic State (IS) group. Additional air defences are being sent to the base, a US official told CBS News on Tuesday, including a system designed to intercept drones. ""Certainly all roads of responsibility lead back to Iran,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner told BBC News, also linking the country to attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement against ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. ""This needs to be responded in a way where they understand that we're not going to just continue to play defensive,"" he said. He added that the US reaction would force Iran to ""understanding that this is a conflict that is going to come to their doorstep"". Mr Biden has been weighing a number of retaliatory options, including strikes on Iran-aligned militia bases and commanders. The US could also target senior commanders of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iraq or Syria. It is also possible that the US will attack inside Iran's borders, a move which is considered the highest possible escalation that Mr Biden could take. In New York, the Iranian envoy to the UN, Amir Saeed Iravani, warned that Iran would ""decisively respond to any attack on the country, its interests and nationals under any pretexts"",Iran's state news agency Irna reported. He also denied reports that several messages had been exchanged between the US and Iran via intermediaries over the past two days. Iran has built a wide network of allied armed groups and proxies operating in countries across the Middle East. They are all opposed to Israel and the US, and sometimes refer to themselves as the ""Axis of Resistance"", though the extent of Iran's influence over them is not clear. The US says co-ordination is overseen by the IRGC and its overseas operations arm, the Quds Force. Both are designated by the US as terrorist organisations, as are a number of the regional armed groups, including Kataib Hezbollah. The groups have dramatically stepped up their attacks against Israel, US forces and other linked targets since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip in October, in what they say is a demonstration of their solidarity with the Palestinian people. Many of the at least 165 drone, rocket and missile attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria, or facilities hosting US troops, since 17 October have been claimed by an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. In response, the US says it has struck targets belonging to the IRGC and militias believed to have strong links with the force, including Kataib Hezbollah, Harakat al-Nujaba and Asaib Ahl al-Haq. Sunday's attack, which the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it was behind, was the first to kill US troops in the region since the start of the Gaza war. Last month, the US said it carried out air strikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US service members were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq. Earlier in January, a US strike in Baghdad killed a leader of Harakat al-Nujaba who was accused of being behind attacks on US personnel. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week that strikes on three facilities in Iraq belonging to Kataib Hezbollah and other groups were ""in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks"" against US and other international forces in Iraq and Syria.

"Injured, hungry and alone - the Gazan children orphaned by warPublished31 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Born amid the horrors of the war in Gaza, the month-old baby girl lying in an incubator has never known a parent's embrace. She was delivered by Caesarean section after her mother, Hanna, was crushed in an Israeli air strike. Hanna did not live to name her daughter. ""We just call her the daughter of Hanna Abu Amsha,"" says nurse Warda al-Awawda, who is caring for the tiny newborn at the al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions which some may find upsetting. In the chaos caused by the ongoing fighting and with entire families almost wiped out, medics and rescuers often struggle to find carers for bereaved children. ""We have lost contact with her family,"" the nurse tells us. ""None of her relatives have shown up and we don't know what happened to her father."" Children, who make up nearly half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, have had their lives shattered by the brutal war. Although Israel says it strives to avoid civilian casualties, including issuing evacuation orders, more than 11,500 under-18s have been killed according to Palestinian health officials. Even more have injuries, many of them life-changing. It is hard to get accurate figures but according to a recent report from Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, a non-profit group, more than 24,000 children have also lost one or both parents. Ibrahim Abu Mouss, just 10 years old, suffered severe leg and stomach injuries when a missile hit his home. But his tears are for his dead mum, grandfather and sister. ""They kept telling me they were being treated upstairs in the hospital,"" says Ibrahim as his father clutches his hand. ""But I found out the truth when I saw photos on my dad's phone. I cried so much that I hurt all over."" The cousins of the Hussein family used to play together but now they sit solemnly by the sandy graves where some of their relatives are buried by a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza. Each has lost one or both parents. ""The missile fell on my mum's lap and her body was torn into pieces. For days we were taking her body parts from the rubble of the house,"" says Abed Hussein, who lived in al-Bureij refugee camp. ""When they said that my brother, my uncle and my whole family were killed I felt like my heart was bleeding with fire."" With dark bags around his eyes, Abed stays awake at night frightened by the sounds of Israeli shelling and feeling alone. ""When my mum and dad were alive, I used to sleep but after they were killed, I can't sleep any more. I used to sleep next to my dad,"" he explains. Abed and his two surviving siblings are being looked after by his grandmother but everyday life is very hard. ""There's no food or water,"" he says. ""I have a stomach ache from drinking sea water."" Kinza Hussein's father was killed trying to fetch flour to make bread. She is haunted by the image of his corpse, brought home for burial after he was killed by a missile. ""He had no eyes, and his tongue was cut,"" she remembers. ""All we want is for the war to be over,"" she says. ""Everything is sad."" Nearly everyone in Gaza now relies on aid handouts for the basics of life. According to UN figures, some 1.7 million people have been displaced, with many forced to move repeatedly in search of safety. But the UN's children's agency, Unicef, says its biggest concern is for an estimated 19,000 children who are orphaned or have ended up alone with no adult to look after them. ""Many of these children have been found under the rubble or have lost their parents in the bombing of their home,"" Jonathan Crickx, chief of communications for Unicef Palestine, tells me from Rafah in southern Gaza. Others have been found at Israeli checkpoints, hospitals and on the streets. ""The youngest ones very often cannot say their name and even the older ones are usually in shock so it can be extremely difficult to identify them and potentially regroup them with their extended family."" Even when relatives can be found, they are not always well placed to help care for bereaved children. ""Let's keep in mind they are often also in a very dire situation,"" Mr Crickx says. ""They may have their own children to take care of and it can be difficult, if not impossible, for them to take care of these unaccompanied and separated children."" Since the war started, a non-profit organisation, SOS Children's Villages, which works locally with Unicef, says it has been working to take in 55 such children, all aged under 10. It has employed additional specialist staff in Rafah to give psychological help. A senior SOS staff member tells me about a four-year-old who had been left at a checkpoint. She was brought in with selective mutism, an anxiety disorder which left her unable to speak about what had happened to her and her family, but is now making progress after being welcomed with gifts and playing with other children she lives with. Unicef believes that nearly all children in Gaza are now in need of mental health support. With their lives shattered, even when there is a lasting ceasefire, many will be left with terrible losses that they will struggle to overcome.",2024-01-31T06:00:55.000Z

Israel Gaza: UN warning that aid system could collapse if UNRWA funding is withheldPublished31 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Top UN officials have warned that the withdrawal of funding for its main aid agency in Gaza could lead to the ""collapse of the humanitarian system"". They spoke out after the US, UK and other countries halted funding over the alleged role of some UN staff in the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. The UN sacked several of its staff over the allegations. It said an investigation into its agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, is underway. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described UNRWA as ""perforated with Hamas"", saying Israel has ""discovered that there were 13 UNRWA workers who actually participated, either directly or indirectly, in the 7 October massacre"". But the US, the biggest donor to the UNWRA, has said it wants to see the aid agency continue its work. ""There is no other humanitarian player in Gaza who can provide food and water and medicine at the scale that UNRWA does,"" US State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller said. ""We want to see that work continued which is why it is so important that the United Nations take this matter seriously, that they investigate, that there is accountability for anyone who is found to have engaged in wrongdoing."" In the attack on 7 October, Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages. Israel launched an offensive against Hamas in response and more than 26,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. More than half of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed during the offensive, new analysis seen by the BBC has revealed. UN Secretary General António Guterres has said a full independent investigation into UNRWA is under way, A UNRWA spokesperson has said that if funding is not resumed, the agency will not be able to continue its operations beyond the end of February. ""The allegations of involvement of several UNRWA staff in the heinous attacks on Israel on 7 October are horrifying,"" astatementby the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee says. ""As the secretary-general has said, any UN employee involved in acts of terror will be held accountable. However, we must not prevent an entire organisation from delivering on its mandate to serve people in desperate need. ""Withdrawing funds from UNRWA is perilous and would result in the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza, with far-reaching humanitarian and human rights consequences in the occupied Palestinian territory and across the region,"" it adds. ""The world cannot abandon the people of Gaza."" Also on Tuesday, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for Gaza said no other organisation can replace UNRWA due to the the agency's ""knowledge"" of the population in Gaza. Other countries which have halted funding include Germany, Sweden an Japan. Mr Guterres met representatives of more than 30 donor states on Tuesday and is reported to have urged those who have withdrawn funding to reconsider. Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas.

Hamas says it is studying proposal for new pause in Gaza fightingPublished30 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hamas's political leader has confirmed it is studying a new proposal to pause the fighting in the Gaza Strip. Ismail Haniyeh said the group had been invited to discuss a framework set out by Israel, the US, Qatar and Egypt. It reportedly proposes a six-week truce, when more Israeli hostages would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. Mr Haniyeh stressed that Hamas's priorities were a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal, but Israel's prime minister ruled them out. Benjamin Netanyahu insisted the war would not end until ""total victory"" had been achieved, which he said meant the elimination of Hamas and the release of all hostages. The conflict was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 others taken hostage. More than 26,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. During a week-long ceasefire in late November, 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Israel says 136 hostages are still being held, although about two dozen of those are presumed to be dead. On Sunday, Qatar's prime minister, the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency and Egypt's intelligence chief held talks in Paris with the heads of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency and Shin Bet internal security agency. They agreed the terms of a framework for a second pause in the fighting, whichUS media reports said would see Hamas release any remaining elderly, women and child hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during an initial period of six weeks. If that was successful, there could be another two phases of swaps, with male Israeli soldiers eventually included. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday that he could not confirm the details of the proposal, but called it ""a strong one and a compelling one"". The Israeli prime minister's office called the talks ""constructive"", but noted that there were ""significant gaps which the parties will continue to discuss"". On Tuesday morning, Hamas's Qatar-based political chief said it had received an invitation to go to Cairo to discuss the framework and would respond ""on the basis that the priority is to halt the aggression on Gaza and pull the occupation forces out"". Mr Haniyeh stressed that Hamas was ""open to discussing any new practical initiative or ideas, provided that they should lead to a comprehensive halt to the aggression, securing shelter for our displaced people... rebuilding [Gaza], lifting the blockade and achieving a serious swap of the captives to guarantee freeing our prisoners"" in Israeli jails. Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, meanwhile threatened to ""dismantle"" the coalition government if a ""reckless deal"" was reached with Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries. Later, Mr Netanyahu appeared to address the remarks by both men. ""I would like to make it clear: We will not conclude this war without achieving all of its goals,"" the prime minister said in a speech in the occupied West Bank. ""This means eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel."" ""We will not withdraw [forces] from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousands of terrorists. None of this will happen. What will happen? Total victory!"" The developments came as battles raged between Israeli forces and Hamas fighters across Gaza, particularly in the southern city of Khan Younis. On Tuesday afternoon,the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israeli tanks were stationed in the ""front yard"" of Al-Amal Hospital, which is in the west of the city, and that they were ""firing live ammunition and smoke grenades at the displaced individuals and PRCS staff"". ""We deeply worry for the safety of our teams, the wounded, the sick, and thousands of displaced people in the building. Fires have broken out in tents within the confines of the PRCS Headquarters,"" it added. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it ""did not operate inside Al-Amal Hospital or request its evacuation"" on Tuesday. ""The IDF has maintained close communication with the hospital, additionally, monitoring efforts show that the Al-Amal hospital is functioning and has adequate fuel and electricity."" ""On Monday, the IDF was informed that the oxygen supply at Al-Amal hospital was at risk, which prompted the IDF to facilitate the replenishment of two oxygen tanks that arrived to Al-Amal hospital that same afternoon,"" it added. The IDF has previously accused Hamas of operating inside and launching attacks from hospitals, which the group and local medics have denied. Intense fighting and bombardment have also been reported around the nearby Nasser Hospital, which is the largest medical facility still functioning in Gaza. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said on Monday that the handful of medics remaining there were contending with very low suppliesto treat between 300 and 350 patients who not could be evacuated. Rami, an MSF nurse, described how surgeons in the emergency department were being forced to reuse abdominal gauze. ""They use it once, then squeeze out the blood, wash it, sterilise it and reuse it with another patient,"" he said. The IDF believes top Hamas commanders are holed up inside tens of kilometres of tunnels beneath Khan Younis, possibly along with hostages. It says it has so far ""eliminated over 2,000 terrorists above and below ground"" there and uncovered facilities for holding hostages and command centres. On Tuesday, the IDF confirmed that it had been pumping ""large volumes"" of water into parts of Hamas's vast network of tunnels across Gaza. There was widespread concern when its plan was first reported. Hostages' families feared it could threaten their lives and experts said using seawater could gravely damage the aquifer that is Gaza's only natural water source. ""The capability was developed in a professional capacity, including analysis of the soil characteristics and the water systems in the area to ensure that damage is not done to the area's groundwater,"" the IDF said. ""The pumping of water was only carried out in tunnel routes and locations that were suitable, matching the method of operation to each case.""

Biden says he has decided US response to Jordan attackPublished30 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"President Joe Biden says he has decided how the US will respond to a drone strike that killed three American troops in Jordan at the weekend. Mr Biden did not elaborate in his remarks at the White House, but added: ""I don't think we need a wider war in the Middle East."" An Iran-backed militia group has claimed responsibility for the attack at a US military base. Dozens more were injured in Sunday's strike near the Syrian border. The overnight drone attack was the first time US soldiers were killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the Israel Gaza war erupted on 7 October. Asked by reporters on Tuesday morning if he had decided how to respond to the attack, Mr Biden said: ""Yes."" He was also asked if Iran should be blamed. ""I do hold them [Iran] responsible in the sense that they're supplying the weapons to the people who did it,"" he said. Iran has denied any involvement. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the US might take a ""tiered approach"" in its response. ""Not just a single action, but potentially multiple actions... over a period of time,"" he told reporters on board Air Force One for Mr Biden's trip to attend election fundraisers in Florida. ""The guiding principle is making sure that we continue to degrade the kinds of capabilities that these groups have at their disposal to use against our troops and our facilities,"" he said. Mr Kirby added: ""The president will do what he has to do to protect our troops and our facilities and to look after our national security."" The president has a number of options, including retaliatory strikes on Iran-allied bases and commanders. The US could also target senior commanders of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps in Iraq or Syria. In recent months, several US bases in the Middle East have been attacked by militias trained, funded and equipped by Iran. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq - which is made up of several Iran-affiliated militias operating - has claimed responsibility for Sunday's strike. It has also said it mounted other attacks against US forces in recent weeks. Kataib Hezbollah, an armed faction of the Islamic Resistance, said on Tuesday itwould suspend all its military operations against US troopsin the region to avoid ""embarrassment"" for the Iraqi government. The weekend's deadly strike in north-eastern Jordan hit an American military base known as Tower 22. About 350 US forces are stationed at the facility, which US Central Command says is focused on defeating the Islamic State group. The strike killed Sgt William Jerome Rivers, 46, Specialist Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Specialist Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23. More than 40 others were wounded, including 34 people who officials say were evaluated for possible traumatic brain injuries. The White House said on Tuesday Mr Biden had spoken with the family members of the three troops. The president will attend the ""dignified transfer"" of their bodies at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Friday, the national security spokesman told reporters. Mr Biden told the families ""how proud we all are of their service, how we mourn and feel sorrow over their loss"", Mr Kirby said. The enemy drone struck while an American drone was returning to the base from a mission. Officials say the base's air defence auto-response features were turned off to avoid shooting down the US drone. But because of that, there was no warning for troops who were reportedly still in their sleeping quarters. A supplementary air defence system, called the Coyote, is being sent to Tower 22 to help intercept drones, the BBC's US partner, CBS News, reported. Tower 22's air defences were not as robust as those of other bases in the region, an unnamed official said.",2024-01-30T20:58:11.000Z

"UK considering recognising Palestine state, Lord Cameron saysPublished30 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Britain is ready to bring forward the moment when it formally recognises a Palestinian state, the foreign secretary has suggested. Lord Cameron said Palestinians had to be given a political horizon to encourage peace in the Middle East. He is beginning his fourth visit to the region since beingappointed foreign secretary in November. The UK has a responsibility to set out what a Palestinian state would look like, he told a Westminster reception. The Palestinian people would have to be shown ""irreversible progress"" towards a two-state solution, Lord Cameron said. ""As that happens, we - with allies - will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations,"" he told the Conservative Middle East Council. ""That could be one of the things that helps to make this process irreversible."" The foreign secretary also urged Israel to allow more humanitarian support into Gaza and said it was ""ludicrous"" that vital British and other aid was being sent back at the border. Lord Cameron said the last 30 years had been a story of failure for Israel because it had failed to provide security to its citizens. Only by recognising that failure, he said, would there be peace and progress. Britain has long supported a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians could live side by side in separate countries. But Lord Cameron is suggesting Britain could give formal, diplomatic recognition to a Palestinian state not as part of a final peace deal, but earlier, during the negotiations themselves. At the same time, there would have to be a new Palestinian authority ""stood up quickly"" with ""technocratic and good leaders"" able to govern Gaza, he said. Lord Cameron added: ""Together with that, almost most important of all, is to give the Palestinian people a political horizon so that they can see that there is going to be irreversible progress to a two-state solution and crucially the establishment of a Palestinian state. ""We have a responsibility there because we should be starting to set out what a Palestinian state would look like, what it would comprise, how it would work and crucially, looking at the issue, that as that happens, we with allies will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations. ""That could be one of the things that helps to make this process irreversible."" As part of any long-term deal, the foreign secretary said Israel would need to see all hostages released, with a guarantee that Hamas could not launch attacks on Israel and its leadership had left Gaza. He said a deal would be ""difficult"" but not impossible. Husam Zomlot, head of the Palestinian mission in London, said Lord Cameron's comments were ""historic"", because for first time the UK was considering recognising a Palestinian state ""as a contribution to a peaceful solution rather than an outcome"". However, the idea of fast-tracking Palestinian statehood prompted anger from some Conservative MPs. Former minister Theresa Villiers told the Commons ""bringing forward and accelerating unilateral recognition of Palestinian state would be to reward Hamas' atrocities"". Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell said the government would not recognise a Palestinian state ""bilaterally"" but would do so ""at a time when it best serves the objective of peace"". The Israeli government has yet to comment. On the ongoing efforts to end the war in Gaza, Lord Cameron said a pause in the fighting was needed now and there were ""hopeful signs"" about the negotiations under way. ""There is a path that we can now see opening up where we really can make progress, not just in ending the conflict, but progress in finding a political solution that can mean peace for years rather than peace for months,"" he said. The real challenge would be to ""turn that pause into a sustainable ceasefire without a return to the fighting, he said. ""That is the prize we should be looking for, and more than that, not just how you go from pause to sustainable ceasefire, but how you go from there to a set of political moves and arrangements that could start to deliver the longer term political solution,"" Lord Cameron said. ""Although it is incredibly difficult, although efforts in the past have failed, we cannot give up. ""If the last 30 years tells us anything, it is a story of failure. ""Ultimately it is a story of failure for Israel because yes, they had a growing economy, yes they had rising living standards, yes they invested in defence and security and walls and the rest of it, but they couldn't provide what a state most wants, what every family wants, which is security. ""And so the last 30 years has been a failure. ""And it is only by recognising that failure and recognising that true peace and progress will come when the benefits of peace and progress are greater than the benefits of returning to fighting.""",2024-01-30T18:18:18.000Z

Israeli forces kill three Palestinian fighters in West Bank hospital raidPublished30 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli forces have killed three members of Palestinian armed groups in a hospital in the occupied West Bank. CCTV footage showed members of an undercover unit disguised as medics and other civilians making their way through a corridor with rifles raised. The Israeli military said the men were hiding in the Jenin hospital, and that one was about to carry out an attack. The Palestinian Authority's ministry of health accused Israel of carrying out a ""new massacre inside hospitals"". Hamas, an armed Palestinian Islamist group which is fighting a war with Israel in Gaza triggered by its unprecedented attacks on Israel on 7 October, said the Israeli forces had ""executed three fighters"", including one of its members. Another armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, said two of those killed were its members and were brothers. It added that one of them had been receiving treatment at the hospital. The security camera video from Ibn Sina hospital shows several members of the Israeli undercover unit - men and women - hurrying through a corridor, training their weapons left and right. One can be seen taking a piece of clothing off an unidentified person who is kneeling down with his hands behind his head, then covering his head with it. The footage shows two members of the unit carrying a folded wheelchair and a baby-carrier, apparently as props. Images from the room where the men are said to have been shot show blood-spattered floors and walls with a bloodied, blue pillow with a bullet hole in it on a bed. ""They executed the three men as they slept in the room,"" the hospital's director, Dr Naji Nazzal, told Reuters. ""They executed them in cold blood by firing bullets directly into their heads in the room where they were being treated."" The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the guardian of the Geneva Conventions which codify international humanitarian law, has expressed concern over the raid. ""Under international humanitarian law, hospitals and medical patients should be respected and protected at all times"", the ICRC said, adding that it would raise the issue ""as part of its confidential dialogue with the concerned authorities"". Tensions have soared in the West Bank since the 7 October attacks, with near daily Israeli arrest raids and clashes with Palestinians. Jenin, a militant stronghold, has been a focus of such raids for months. Since 7 October, Israeli forces have killed at least 357 Palestinians - militants, civilians and attackers - in the West Bank, while Israeli settlers have killed at least eight, according to the United Nations. Palestinians from the West Bank have killed at least 10 Israelis in attacks in the West Bank and Israel in the same period. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the Hamas suspect who was killed had ""planned a raid attack inspired by the October 7th massacre"". On that date, waves of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel from Gaza, killed about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and took about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered Israel's military campaign in Gaza, with the declared aim of destroying Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 26,600 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in the Israeli offensive. The official Palestinian news agency in the West Bank, Wafa, said the three Palestinians in the hospital had been ""assassinated"". According to its sources in the hospital, about 10 members of Israeli special forces dressed in civilian clothes went to the third floor, where they killed the men using weapons fitted with silencers. Dr Naji Nazzal said one of the men, who PIJ identified as its member, had been receiving treatment at the hospital since 25 October for a spinal injury which had left him paralysed. Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.",2024-01-30T17:35:48.000Z

"At least half of Gaza's buildings damaged or destroyed, new analysis showsPublished30 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","More than half of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed since Israel launched its retaliation for the Hamas attacks of 7 October, new analysis seen by the BBC reveals. Detailed before-and-after imagery also shows how the bombardment of southern and central Gaza has intensified since the start of December, with the city of Khan Younis bearing much of the brunt of Israel's military action. Israel has repeatedly told Gazans to move south for their own safety. Across Gaza, residential areas have been left ruined, previously busy shopping streets reduced to rubble, universities destroyed and farmlands churned up, with tent cities springing up on the southern border to house many thousands of people left homeless. About 1.7 million people - more than 80% of Gaza's population - are displaced, with nearly half crammed in the far southern end of the strip,according to the United Nations. Further analysis, by BBC Verify, reveals the scale of destruction of farmland, identifying multiple areas of extensive damage. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it is targeting both Hamas fighters and ""terror infrastructure"", when challenged over the scale of damage. Now, satellite data analysis obtained by the BBC shows the true extent of the destruction. The analysis suggests between 144,000 and 175,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip have been damaged or destroyed. That's between 50% and 61% of Gaza's buildings. The analysis, carried out by Corey Scher of City University of New York and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University, compares images to reveal sudden changes in the height or structure of buildings which indicate damage. The southern city of Khan Younis has been particularly badly hit in recent weeks, with more than 38,000 (or more than 46%) of buildings now destroyed or damaged, according to the analysis. Over the past fortnight, more than 1,500 buildings have been destroyed or damaged there. Al-Farra Tower - a 16-storey residential block in the centre of the city, the tallest building in the area - was flattened on 9 January as can be seen in before-and-after images of the city's skyline. Much of the neighbourhood in which it sits has been levelled by Israeli attacks since late December. ""Israeli forces targeted residential complexes, especially in the downtown Khan Younis area,"" said Rawan Qaddah, a 20-year-old resident, who has been displaced and has lost contact with her family. She named schools among the many buildings which had been damaged. Some were now being used to house displaced people temporarily. You can clearly see the level of damage from street level. Once bustling high streets have been left derelict or destroyed. These images show the front of the Shawarma Sanabel restaurant before Israel's invasion, and how the same junction looked in a composite image from January after intense bombardment of the area. The IDF has repeatedly justified its actions by noting that Hamas deliberately embeds itself in civilian areas and explained destruction of buildings in the light of targeting fighters. But questions have been asked about destruction of buildings seemingly firmly in the control of the IDF. One example was the Israa University, in northern Gaza - initially badly damaged shortly before being blown up completely in what looked like a massive controlled explosion. The videowas widely shared on social mediaand the IDF says the approval process for the blast is now being investigated. Many of Gaza's historic sites have suffered extensive damage,including the al-Omari Mosqueoriginally built in the 7th Century. Mr Scher, one of the academics who worked on the Gaza damage assessment, said it stands out compared with other war zones he's analysed. ""We've done work over Ukraine, we've also looked at Aleppo and other cities, but the extent and the pace of damage is remarkable. I've never seen this much damage appear so quickly."" Further analysis, carried out by BBC Verify, shows large areas of previously cultivated land across Gaza have been extensively damaged. As you can see from the satellite image below, several parts of Gaza show the effects of Israeli incursions and bombardment. Although Gaza was heavily dependent on imports before the start of the war, a lot of its food came from farming and food production inside the strip. Aid agencies say half of Gaza's population is now facing starvation. BBC Arabic spoke to one farmer, Saeed, who fled south from Beit Lahia, in the north of Gaza, in mid-November. The 33-year-old grew guava, figs, lemons, oranges, mint, and basil and earned about $6,000 (£5,535) from these crops every year - the only source of income for him, his father and his sister. He had tended to the farm, inherited from his grandparents, for 15 years. But days after fleeing, he says he was told by a relative that the farm had been destroyed by the IDF, along with five surrounding homes which belonged to his relatives. In the north and centre of Gaza, where most agriculture took place before the war, large areas of land appear ruined. In many places the damage corresponds with the construction of temporary Israeli defences, earth banks to protect armoured vehicles, and the clearing of surrounding land. Some farmers have lost their crops even though their land was not directly hit, the BBC understands. Mohamed al-Messaddar, a farmer from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, has only been able to go to his farm once since the beginning of the war. Arriving during the truce in November, oranges were scattered, rotting on the ground. ""The date of harvesting oranges coincided with the beginning of the war. No one would have dared to go there."" He says he lost more than 90% of his orange crop. Beyond the pattern of land affected by bulldozing of roads and building of defences, there have been allegations of deliberate destruction levelled at the IDF. In a video posted online on 4 November, Col Yogev Bar-Shesht, deputy head of the Civil Administration, said in an interview from inside Gaza: ""Whoever returns here, if they return here after, will find scorched earth. No houses, no agriculture, no nothing. They have no future."" The IDF told us it had found Hamas tunnel entrances and rocket launch sites in various agricultural areas, adding that ""operational needs require that these places be destroyed or attacked"". ""Environmental damage may be caused as a result of fighting and exchanges of fire."" Aid experts fear that the damage to Gaza's agriculture will be lasting. Previous conflicts such as those in Syria and Ukraine have shown rehabilitating farmlands can be extremely difficult. Unexploded weapons make it dangerous for farmers to return and work. There's also the challenge of cleaning contaminated lands, and rebuilding infrastructure such as water, energy and transport systems. The final pronounced change in Gaza that can be seen from the air is the proliferation of tents and other temporary structures to house displaced people in the south. Areas of new tents that have sprung up between the start of December and middle of January close to the Egyptian border covered roughly 3.5 sq km, equivalent to nearly 500 Premier League football pitches. The satellite images, captured on 3 December and 14 January, show a dramatic change - now nearly every patch of accessible, undeveloped ground in an area of north west Rafah has been turned into a refuge for displaced people. When it launched its campaign against Hamas, Israel told Palestinians living in north and central Gaza to move south for their own safety. Many have ended up in Rafah and face an uncertain future.

Israel-Gaza war: Counting the destruction of religious sitesPublished30 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Gaza is home to some of the oldest churches and mosques in the world, but many have not escaped the widespread destruction of Israel's military offensive. Of 117 religious sites which were reportedly damaged or destroyed between 7 October, when Israel's campaign began, and 31 December, the BBC has verified 74 cases. Seventy-two are mosques and two are churches. Israel's offensive was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on 7 October. In its investigation, the BBC used satellite imagery and user generated content to examine evidence from both before and after buildings were hit. In a statement, Hamas - the Palestinian Islamist group which rules Gaza - said 378 mosques and three churches had been hit up to 9 January, though this figure has not been independently verified. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says Hamas fighters are using places of worship for cover and as places from which to launch attacks - something Hamas denies. Believed to be one of the oldest churches in the world, St Porphyrius is one of a handful dotted around the Gaza Strip. Many of the territory's small Christian population, which before the war numbered about 1,000, has a strong connection to the land. St Porphyrius was a 5th Century bishop in Gaza whose tomb lies under the church. Like many Palestinian Christians, Marian Saba and her family sought refuge within the church grounds, believing they would be safe. But on 19 October, as the night drew in, an Israeli missile hit one of the church's outer buildings, killing 18 people and injuring many more. Marian said her 34-year-old brother-in-law Soliman was killed as he shielded his son from a collapsing wall. ""It was a horrifying scene. I have never seen a dead body. I didn't know what to say,"" she said. ""It was an immediate death."" Rami Tarazi was in one of the church's halls at the time of the blast. ""It was a rocket missile that was so big even the people who were in the other hall came out in white dust,"" he said of the explosion, which did not impact the main building. ""We pulled out 16 people in pieces and two full corpses,"" he vividly recalls. One of the people killed was Rami's 36-year-old cousin Suliman, who Rami says had been ""talking and laughing"" with him just an hour earlier. According to international humanitarian law, intentionally targeting religious buildings during conflict is a war crime. There is an exception, however, if such sites are being used for military purposes. Videos uploaded by the IDF to social media show soldiers entering religious buildings it has targeted and showing underground tunnels it says were used by Hamas. In this case, the IDF told the BBC that the church was not the intended target of the strike despite its grounds being hit as a result. It said the incident was under review. Some videos and photos being shared online also purport to show Israeli soldiers disrespecting the sanctity of religious places and glorifying destruction. One image seen on X, formerly known as Twitter, shows an Israeli soldier posing in front of a fallen minaret which has been graffitied in Hebrew with the words ""the temple will be rebuilt"" - a reference to a belief that a third Jewish temple will be built on the contested holy site in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif or the al-Aqsa Mosque compound. The IDF said the behaviour of the soldier in the image was ""severe and not in accordance with the IDF's values"", adding that it was investigating the incident. Dr Georgia Andreou from the Institute of Archaeology at University College London has been looking into the destruction of heritage sites in the Gaza Strip. She says many holy sites have great historical significance, and that the destruction of sacred, as well as heritage, sites in Gaza is ""the worst I have ever seen"". Many of the mosques in Gaza have been razed, and unlike those who take shelter in churches, Palestinian Muslims are choosing to seek refuge away from their places of worship. In Khan Younis, the BBC verified that Khalil Al-Rahman mosque, which had reportedly been hit in an air strike in the area, had been damaged. As a devout Muslim, Renad Alaa al-Bataa frequented this mosque, where she learnt to memorise the Quran. But since the war started she has not been back. ""Previously, the IDF seldom targeted mosques unless there were alleged militant targets. But this time, they've destroyed several beautiful mosques that nurtured us and taught us about our religion,"" she said. During a week-long truce that took place in November, she says, the muezzin - the person who makes the call to prayer - devised a makeshift minaret and began calling for prayers five times a day from the top of what remains of Khalil Al-Rahman mosque. She says it brought her a sense of security that ended when Israel resumed fighting against Hamas. One of the starkest images of destruction to emerge from Khan Younis is a video that shows the sudden and quick flattening of Khalid bin Al-Waleed mosque. It has been viewed nearly 15m times on X. According to Chris Partridge, a weapons analyst for the BBC, the video appears to show a precision guided bomb that has been dropped from an aircraft hitting the mosque before it erupts into a cloud of flames and smoke. The clue in the choice of munition, he says, is its precision. It is unclear how many of the religious sites we have verified have been destroyed by the IDF or how many have been used by Hamas. However, the IDF says it is acting in accordance with international law to dismantle Hamas's military and administrative capabilities and taking precautions to mitigate civilian harm. The BBC asked the IDF whether it had struck both Khalil bin Al-Rahman and Khalid bin Al-Waleed mosque. A spokesperson said they had struck sites ""which Hamas used for terrorist purposes"", without specifying. Amid the destruction of many of Gaza's places of worship, faith has increasingly become a spiritual safety blanket for many Palestinians running away from death. Marian Saba and her family continue to shelter at St Porphyrius Church with approximately 300 others, attending Sunday Mass weekly. Nine days after it was damaged, her daughter Kylie was baptised. She described it as a bittersweet moment. What should have been a joyous occasion was anxiously brought forward by the fear that her child might be killed without one. In a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah, Renad Alaa al-Bataa is far from her home and mosque in Khan Younis. Instagram is now her diary, with nostalgia often taking over, as she posts photos of her old life, including her time as a dentistry student. But she says the Quran, which she reads daily, is her place of solace: ""It lessens the heaviness of the night. If only you knew how hard the nights in Gaza are.""

UNRWA: Gaza aid agency says it is 'extremely desperate' after funding haltedPublished29 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"More countries have halted funding to the largest UN agency operating in Gaza, as the crisis deepens over the alleged role of some staff in the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. Japan and Austria said they were suspending payments to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. The US, UK, Germany and Italy are also among those who have suspended funding. UNRWA has told the BBC it is ""extremely desperate"" and that ""the humanitarian needs in Gaza are growing by the hour"". The agency has sacked several of its staff over allegations they were involved on 7 October, when Hamas gunmen infiltrated Israel, killing about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages. More than 26,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a major military operation in response, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says. Another 1.7 million people have fled their homes, with many of them sheltering at UNRWA facilities. According to a report in the New York Times, an Israeli intelligence dossier alleges that nearly 200 UNRWA workers are Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives, without providing detailed evidence. The dossier also alleges that at least 12 workers crossed into Israel on 7 October. UNRWA has sacked nine of those employees and says it is investigating. Another report published by the Wall Street Journal, also citing the Israeli intelligence dossier, alleges that about 1,200 of UNRWA's 12,000 employees in Gaza have links to Hamas or Islamic Jihad. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to confirm the contents of the dossier, describing the agency as ""perforated with Hamas"". ""We discovered that there were 13 UNRWA workers who actually participated, either directly or indirectly, in the 7 October massacre,"" he said in an interview with UK channel TalkTV. ""In UNRWA schools, they've been teaching the doctrines of extermination for Israel - the doctrines of terrorism, glorifying terrorism, lauding terrorism."" The UN has declined to comment, saying an internal investigation into the agency is under way. But earlier on Sunday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""horrified"" by the accusations relating to the 7 October attack. Despite that, he has appealed to donor countries to ""guarantee the continuity of UNRWA's operations"". In a statement on Sunday, he said: ""Of the 12 people implicated, nine were immediately identified and terminated by the Commissioner-General of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini; one is confirmed dead and the identity of the two others is being clarified."" He said Gaza should not be penalised for the allegations. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the reports about UNRWA staff were ""deeply troubling"" and it was ""imperative"" for the organisation to investigate in order to hold people to account and review its procedures. But he said that UNRWA played an ""absolutely indispensable role in trying to make sure that men, women and children who so desperately need assistance in Gaza actually get it"" and added it was therefore imperative that the organisation's role continues. Earlier on Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he had cancelled meetings with Mr Lazzarini and called on him to resign. An UNRWA spokesperson said that if funding was not resumed, the agency would not be able to continue its operations beyond the end of February. Announcing its decision to suspend payment, Japan's foreign ministry said late on Sunday that it was ""extremely concerned about the alleged involvement of UNRWA staff members in the terror attack on Israel"". It added that it had been ""strongly urging"" UNRWA to investigate the allegations ""in a prompt and complete manner"". Japan is the sixth-largest donor to the agency, according to UNRWA's 2022 figures. On Monday, Austria said it was following suit, calling for ""a comprehensive, swift and complete investigation into the allegations"". Juliette Touma, the director of communications at UNRWA, said in a BBC interview that the allegations were ""extremely serious"" and that Mr Lazzarini had taken an ""extraordinary measure"" in immediately dismissing the staff members in question. ""We are extremely desperate. It has come at a time when the humanitarian needs in Gaza are growing by the hour,"" she said, adding that she had visited the territory herself last week. ""People continue to be displaced. People are hungry. The clock is ticking fast towards famine. ""We are doing everything possible to avert us from getting towards famine. But this lack of funding that we have been faced with now, when at least 10 of the largest donors have put a temporary pause on the funding, this is going to have very, very serious repercussions on what is, right now, the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza."" She said UNRWA had not seen the evidence, but the allegations were being investigated by the UN's oversight office in New York. Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200.

St Patrick's Day: SDLP leader to boycott White House celebrationsPublished29 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said he ""cannot in good conscience"" attend the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations because of the US response to the Israel-Gaza war. Instead, the SDLP will send a delegation to Washington ""to make the case for an end to violence"". Hamas killed about 1,200 people in attacks on Israel on 7 October. More than 26,000 Palestinians have died in Israel's retaliatory attacks, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. More than240 Israelis were taken hostage on 7 October; about 130 remain missing, believed to be being held in Gaza. Mr Eastwood described the response of the international community to the conflict as ""heinously deficient"". The US administration's response was ""particularly atrocious"", he added. ""The scenes of destruction and annihilation in Gaza represent, in my view, a clear act of genocide,"" he said, in a statement. Last week, judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled thatIsrael must take all measures to prevent genocidal actsin Gaza. The ICJ delivered the interim ruling inSouth Africa's genocide case against Israel, but the UN's top court stopped short of ordering an immediate ceasefire. On Sunday, Irish Justice Minister Helen McEntee voiced support for Ireland joining South Africa's challenge, but acknowledged the Irish government needed time to study all aspects of the case. ""Personally I would like us to,"" she told RTÉ Radio One. ""I am very much aware that we need to do so on a correct legal basis. I mean, what you are doing essentially is accusing another country of genocide. You need to know the facts."" Following the interim ruling, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said the government would ""strongly consider"" an intervention in South Africa's case and he has asked his legal team to produce a report. He added there will be engagement with ""like-minded countries"" on this. Mr Eastwood said Ireland and the US have ""forged one of the warmest and most enduring international relationships"", and it is because of this he believes there is a ""duty to be honest with our friends... especially when we think they're wrong"". He added: ""I could not rub shoulders, drink Guinness, and have the craic while the horrifying impacts of the brutal war in Gaza continue. It would be the very opposite of solidarity with a people on the brink of destruction."" Politicians from the island of Irelandtraditionally visit Washington DC for the 17 March celebrations, with the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) hosted by the US president in the White House. Mr Eastwood said each political leader ""will have to take their own decision on how they approach St Patrick's Day"". ""I am offering no criticism of anyone else,"" he added. ""There is no easy answer to any of this."" Some Irish politicians have been urged by pro-Palestinian activists to boycott this year's Washington event over US support for Israel. Last week, Sinn Féin's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said her party would not boycott the trip. Instead they intend to use it to advocate for an end to violence. The party hadpreviously called for the expulsionof Israel's ambassador to Ireland, but the motion wasrejected in the Irish parliament. ""We are going to the US in pursuit of peace, continuing to work with the Irish diaspora and US representatives to promote and strengthen the support for the peace process at home and Irish reunification,"" Ms O'Neill told the PA news agency. ""We will also advocate for an end to the Israeli genocidal war and occupation in Gaza and the West Bank, for the establishment of a peace process in Palestine and self-determination for the Palestinian people. ""In doing so, we will fulfil our promise to the Palestinian ambassador and the Palestinian people."" Mr Martin has also said it would be inappropriate to boycott the celebrations. ""The idea that Ireland would just retreat from any engagement to me doesn't make sense,"" he said. The Irish government will persist in its dialogue and engagement with other nations, he added, with an aim of escalating international pressure and bringing an end to the violence in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the Irish government has said there are ""no plans"" to suspendfunding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. It comes after the agency announced the sacking of several of its staff over allegations they were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Martin said he has ""full confidence"" in the agency's commission-general and its internal investigation. The Republic of Ireland provided the agency with €18m (£15.4m) in 2023 and ""will continue our support in 2024"", Mr Martin added. The UK government, which paused funding on Saturday,said it was ""appalled"" by Israel's allegations. The US, Australia, Italy, Canada, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and Germany have also suspended additional funding to the agency.

Kate Osamor: Labour suspends MP over Gaza remarks in Holocaust messagePublished29 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Labour MP Kate Osamor has been suspended by her party after saying Gaza should be remembered as genocide in a post about Holocaust Memorial Day. The Edmonton MP has since apologised for ""any offence caused"" over the message distributed to local party members on Friday. Jewish groups have criticised the remarks. The chief whip suspended her from the parliamentary party while an investigation takes place. Holocaust Memorial Day (HMD) marks the six million Jews and other groups murdered during the Holocaust, alongside recent genocides. Ms Osamor had shared a photograph of herself at a Holocaust Educational Trust event. She wrote: ""Tomorrow is Holocaust Memorial Day, an international day to remember the six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust, the millions of other people murdered under Nazi persecution of other groups and more recent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and now Gaza."" She later tweeted an apology ""for any offence caused by my reference to the ongoing humanitarian disaster in Gaza as part of that period of remembrance"". BBC News has approached Ms Osamor for comment. The Holocaust Educational Trust described her remarks as a ""painful insult to survivors of the Holocaust"". The Board of Deputies of British Jews called her comment ""disgraceful"", while the Jewish Leadership Council accused her of abusing HMD to attack the Jewish state. Shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was not acceptable to equate the Holocaust to the situation in Gaza. ""What is happening in Gaza is clearly a humanitarian catastrophe that is recognised. But there are specific reasons why the Holocaust is considered as it is,"" he told Sky News. Momentum, the pressure group on the left of Labour, called the suspension an ""outrageous decision"" following a ruling by the UN's top court. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israelto take all measures to prevent genocidal actsin Gaza but stopped short of telling it to halt the war. A verdict on the central allegation of genocide is expected to take much longer, possibly years. The 7 October attacks killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel. More than 100 of the 240 hostages who were snatched and taken to Gaza remain in captivity. Meanwhile, Israel's air and ground assaults in the Palestinian territory have killed more than 25,000 people, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says. Labour has urged Israel to comply with the ICJ's ruling on the war, but leader Sir Keir Starmer's position on Israel - supporting its right to defend itself, and later calling for a sustainable ceasefire over the ""intolerable"" situation - has caused tensions within the party. Ms Osamor, who served as shadow international development secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, is the second Labour MP to apologise for remarks about the war in Gaza in a week. During Prime Minister's Questions, Tahir Ali accused Rishi Sunak of having""the blood of thousands of innocent people on his hands""due to his response to the conflict. The Birmingham Hall Green MP later tweeted an apology ""for the way in which I described the prime minister in my question"". A Labour spokesman called his remark ""clearly inappropriate"".",2024-01-29T02:56:59.000Z

UNRWA: Key UN Gaza aid agency runs into diplomatic stormPublished28 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"In Gaza, a strip of land fast becoming a wasteland, few international aid bodies can still operate. The United Nations is one of them. Its Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA, was founded in 1949, working in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, caring for the 700,000 Palestinians who were forced or fled from their homes with the creation of the state of Israel. Now, says the agency's head, the lifesaving assistance on which two million Gazans rely could be about to end, as several Western governments suspend their funding over allegations that some UNRWA staff were involved in the 7 October attacks on Israel. The mission currently runs shelters for the displaced and distributes the only aid that Israel is allowing in - but it is much more than that. UNRWA provides key infrastructure and tools of daily life that Gaza has sorely lacked through its seemingly endless cycles of violence, siege and impoverishment. It runs medical and educational facilities, including teacher training centres and almost 300 primary schools - as well as producing the textbooks that educate young Palestinians. In Gaza alone, it employs some 13,000 people. As the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza, it has been key to humanitarian efforts. And it has also become something of a political football, kicked by various sides over the years. Its very existence is criticised by Israel as entrenching the status of Palestinians as refugees, encouraging their continued hopes of a right of return to land from which they were driven in 1948 or during successive wars. The fate of refugees has been a core issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Many Palestinians harbour a dream of returning to historic Palestine, parts of which are now in Israel. Israel rejects that claim and has often criticised the set-up of UNRWA for the way it allows refugee status to be inherited. Moreover, Israeli governments have long denounced the agency's teaching and textbooks for, in their view, perpetuating anti-Israel views. In 2022, the Israeli watchdog IMPACT-se said UNRWA educational material taught students that Israel was attempting to ""erase Palestinian identity, steal and falsify Palestinian heritage, and erase the cultural heritage of Jerusalem"", adding that the agency promoted ""anti-Semitism, hate, intolerance and lack of neutrality"". The European Commission identified what it called ""anti-Semitic material"" in the schoolbooks, ""including even incitement to violence"". The European Parliament has called repeatedly for EU funding to the Palestinian Authority to be conditional on removing such content. UNRWA has previously said that reports made about its educational material were ""inaccurate and misleading"" and that many of the books in question were not used in its schools. In 2018, the administration of Donald Trump, a staunch supporter of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ceased financial support altogether for UNRWA, calling the body ""irredeemably flawed"". Now, as several Western governments freeze their funding, the agency is again in potentially serious trouble - with significant implications for the 5.3 million Palestinian refugees registered with it. The US, one of the countries taking the decision, is its biggest donor, contributing some $340m (£268m) in 2022. Germany, which has also suspended financing, comes next, having sent $162m that year. Israel has long accused branches of the UN of bias, antisemitism and worse. And now, a government facing increasing criticism at home and abroad over the war in Gaza has seized on this opportunity to bolster its argument - and somewhat shift the focus. For Israel's Western allies, this is also a chance to show understanding and support for Israel while at the same time keeping up the pressure on its government to rein in the offensive. Despite pausing funds, White House National Security Adviser John Kirby was at pains to point out that the violations of a handful of staff ""should not impugn the entire agency"", which, he added had ""helped save literally thousands of lives in Gaza. They do important work"". Israel's foreign minister has labelled UNRWA ""the civilian arm of Hamas"" and said it should not have a role in post-conflict Gaza, which begs the question: if the United Nations won't be allowed to pick up the pieces of a shattered territory, what will?",2024-01-28T14:45:08.000Z

'No plans' for more Scottish aid to UN Gaza agencyPublished28 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Scottish government says it has no plans at present for further funding to a UN agency facing claims some of its staff were involved in Hamas attacks. Last year Scottish ministers announced two donations totalling £750,000 for UNRWA's appeal for Gaza. A number of countries have suspended new funding after the agency sacked several of its staff. First Minister Humza Yousaf said while no more Scottish aid was planned, it was not a suspension of funding. Israel claims to have evidence that UNRWA employees were involved in the 7 October attacks by Hamas. UNRWA said it had launched a full investigation into information supplied by Israel, and that anyone involved in acts of terror would be held accountable. But the agency's head Philippe Lazzarini has urged countries to reconsider decisions to halt funding, saying that more than two million people in Gaza depend on it for ""sheer survival"". A Scottish government spokesperson said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the allegations about UNRWA staff. ""Given our recent funding of UNRWA, we have separately been in direct touch with them today and have requested further updates on the investigation. We have no plans to provide further support to UNRWA at this stage,"" the spokesperson said. ""These allegations are particularly concerning at a time when the international community must continue to find mechanisms to maintain, and increase the levels of life-saving aid getting into Gaza."" First Minister Humza Yousaf later clarified that this was not a suspension of Scottish government funding but rather a reflection of financial pressures. He tweeted: ""To be clear, scotgov has not paused or withdrawn aid to UNRWA ""We have previously provided as much as we can within our financial constraints. ""We will always seek to do more where we can & urge others to continue to provide aid to the people of Gaza."" The UK government has announced a suspension of donations, as has the US State Department, Australia, Canada, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and Italy. But the Irish government has said it will continue funding because the agency provides ""life giving assistance to 2.3m people"". Created in 1949, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, is the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza. Employing 13,000 people in Gaza, it provides health care, education and other humanitarian aid. On Friday Mark Regev, an adviser to the Israeli prime minister, told the BBC the 7 October attacks had involved  ""people who are on their [UNRWA] salaries"". He said there was evidence of teachers working for UNRWA celebrating the attacks and a former hostage had claimed she was held in the house of an agency employee. The head of UNRWA, Mr Lazzarini, said a full investigation into the allegations was being carried out ""to establish the truth without delay"". ""To protect the agency's ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members,"" Mr Lazzarini added. Hamas killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the unprecedented attack on southern Israeli communities on 7 October last year. The events triggered Israel's retaliatory attacks on Hamas in Gaza, which have killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

UNRWA claims: UN chief in aid plea after staff accused of helping Hamas in Israel attackPublished28 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"UN chief António Guterres has urged countries that halted funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, to continue its operations. ""The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met,"" Mr Guterres said. Nine countries, including the UK, have taken action since Israel told UNRWA some staff were involved in the 7 October deadly Hamas attacks on Israel. The agency says it is investigating and has already sacked some employees. The countries that have now suspended funding UNRWA are Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and the US. Created in 1949, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, is the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza. It provides healthcare, education and other humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It employs around 13,000 people inside Gaza. Since Israel began its offensive in response to the Hamas attacks UNRWA has used its facilities across Gaza to shelter hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians. Israel has long accused different branches of the UN - including UNRWA - of bias and even of antisemitism. Details about the Israeli allegations have not been made clear, but reports in the Israeli media suggest UNRWA vehicles and facilities may have been used for the attack in which Hamas gunmen killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 240 hostage. An adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday told the BBC that the 7 October Hamas attacks had involved ""people who are on their [UNRWA] salaries"". Mr Regev also referred to an Israeli hostage who, on her release, said she had been ""held in the house of someone who worked for UNRWA"". In his statement on Saturday, the UN secretary general said that Israel had made allegations against 12 UNRWA employees - nine had been sacked, one had died and the identity of the remaining two was being ""clarified"". Mr Guterres said that he understood the concerns of the governments which have suspended funding. ""I was myself horrified by these accusations,"" he said, adding that ""the abhorrent alleged acts of these staff members must have consequences"". But this should not mean that the many thousands who work for the agency should be penalised, the UN chief said. Mr Guterres's statement followed a strongly-worded reaction by the head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, who called the decision to suspend funds ""shocking"" given the small number of staff facing the Israeli allegations. He made it clear that UNRWA shared the list of its staff with Israel every year and had never received any concerns. Some countries have said they will continue their support for UNRWA. Norway's representative to the Palestinian Authority said the organisation has a ""crucial role"" in distributing aid, and emphasised the ""need to distinguish between what individuals may have done, and what UNRWA stands for"". Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz urged Mr Lazzarini to resign and said he aimed to stop UNRWA operating in Gaza after the war. The 7 October attacks triggered Israel's massive retaliation on Hamas in Gaza - air strikes and shelling that have killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. UNRWA says it is struggling to get humanitarian aid to many of the estimated 1.7 million people - nearly three-quarters of the population - displaced by 12 weeks of fighting. Most recently, the fighting has centred on Khan Younis, where thousands of Palestinians displaced from the north had congregated. Many are now said to be moving further south, towards Rafah on the border with Egypt. Most of northern Gaza has been reduced to ruins as Israel pursues its campaign with the stated aim of eliminating Hamas. Israel says it is destroying a network of tunnels - with estimates that 20-40% had been made unusable so far, according to US and Israeli officials quoted by US newspaper Wall Street Journal.

UNRWA claims: UK halts aid to UN agency over allegation staff helped Hamas attackPublished27 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Several countries including the UK have paused funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. It comes after the agency announced the sacking of several of its staff over allegations they were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks. The UK government said it was ""appalled"" by Israel's allegations. The US, Australia, Italy, Canada, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany have also suspended additional funding to the UN agency.

It says it has ordered an investigation into information supplied by Israel. Israel has long accused different branches of the United Nations including UNRWA of bias and even of antisemitism. Speaking to the BBC, the organisation's former chief spokesperson, Christopher Gunness, said that the suspension of aid to UNRWA was disproportionate and can only lead to further suffering in Gaza. Mr Gunness believes UNRWA has demonstrated its zero-tolerance policy by sacking the staff members before their internal investigation was complete. ""One million displaced people are currently taking refuge in and around UNRWA buildings. They are the ones who will suffer as a result of this decision,"" said Mr Gunness, adding: ""The curtailing of UNRWA services will also destabilise the region at a time when Western governments are trying to contain a regional conflagration."" On Friday, an adviser to the Israeli prime minister told the BBC that the 7 October Hamas attacks had involved ""people who are on their [UNRWA] salaries"". Mark Regev said there was information showing teachers working in UNRWA schools had ""openly celebrated"" the 7 October attacks. He also referred to an Israeli hostage who, on her release, said she had been ""held in the house of someone who worked for UNRWA"". ""They have a union which is controlled by Hamas and I think it's high time that the UN investigated these links between UNRWA and Hamas,"" he added. The allegations prompted reaction from major donors. ""The UK is appalled by allegations that UNRWA staff were involved in the 7 October attack against Israel, a heinous act of terrorism that the UK Government has repeatedly condemned,"" the UK Foreign Office said in a statement. ""The UK is temporarily pausing any future funding of UNWRA whilst we review these concerning allegations,"" it added. Earlier, the US State Department announced that it was suspending additional funding to the UN agency, saying it was ""extremely troubled"" by the allegations of UN staff involvement in the attacks. The EU said that it would assess further steps ""based on the result of the full and comprehensive investigation"". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""horrified by this news"". The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, said a full investigation into the allegations was being carried out ""to establish the truth without delay."" ""To protect the agency's ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members,"" Mr Lazzarini added. He said any staff found to have been involved in ""acts of terror"" would be held accountable. Israel's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz said he aimed to stop UNRWA operating in Gaza after the war. But the Palestinian Authority's minister for civilian affairs, Hussein Al-Sheikh, said the decision by some countries to pause support for the vital UN agency ""entails great political and humanitarian relief risks"". Mr al-Sheikh urged Western donors to immediately reverse their decision, adding: ""We need the maximum support for this international organisation."" The Irish deputy premier, Micheál Martin, said his country had no plans to suspend its funding for the agency, saying it provided ""life saving assistance to 2.3m people and at incredible personal cost - with over 100 staff killed in last four months"". In a post on Telegram, Hamas's press office said the group urged the UN and the international organisations ""to not cave in to the threats and blackmail"" from Israel. Hamas killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the unprecedented attack on southern Israeli communities on 7 October last year. Another 250 people were taken hostage. The events triggered Israel's retaliatory attacks on Hamas in Gaza, which have killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Huge push for Gaza aid - but little hope for those sufferingPublished27 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Qatar Emiri Air Force cargo plane, a hulking grey C17, sat by a runway at the sprawling Al Udeid airbase. Deep inside, Britain's Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron, in black loafers and sweater, attempted to push a pallet of humanitarian aid for Gaza into the aircraft. It wouldn't budge. He stepped back while burly Qatari airmen in combat fatigues made some adjustments. But the former British prime minister wasn't giving up, and with a sudden shift, the bundle - part of nearly 30 tonnes of aid including tents and food - began to move into the belly of the plane. Lord Cameron's latest Middle East tour was aimed at helping to broker a permanent ceasefire to the conflict, the release of the more than 132 remaining hostages, and an increase in the aid getting into Gaza on a daily basis. He's putting in a lot of effort, but so far at least, has little to show for it. Standing by the plane's enormous wings, Lord Cameron told me: ""Nobody wants this conflict to go on a moment longer than necessary. But I've always understood that you won't have a proper ceasefire if you've still got Hamas in place, able to launch attacks on Israel. ""Everyone has to understand, that must be dismantled, otherwise no peace, no ceasefire will be sustainable."" His latest round of in-person diplomacy (the day before he met Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas) came in advance of this weekend's talks under way in France, to free the hostages and pause hostilities. But there still appears little prospect the suffering will end soon in Gaza. There's a chasm between the aid Gaza needs, and will need for years to come, and what it is currently receiving. While Israel's bombardment of Gaza continues, the flow of aid is being drip-fed into the strip. Britain says 500 trucks a day are needed to provide basic needs - most days fewer than 200 make it inside. On one day this month, only 30 crossed into Gaza. ""It's vital we can actually get it into Gaza and crucially, once it's in Gaza, get it around Gaza,"" Lord Cameron said. ""What I was saying yesterday to the Israelis, they've got to deal with the bottlenecks. They've got to make sure the crossing points are opened more often. They've got to make sure the checking is done more quickly. They've got, crucially, to give the visas to the UN staff and the trucks that the UN staff need to get the aid around Gaza."" Nine out of 10 people are living on one meal a day in Gaza, according to the World Food Programme. All aid is subject to stringent inspections by Israel which does not want anything to get inside that could benefit Hamas. Qatar and Britain are allies, the Gulf emirate and Israel are not. It hosts the Hamas political leadership, and has been a key mediator in talks to release the hostages still held by the group, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by several countries. Qatar helped secure the previous week-long ceasefire in November that led to the freeing of 105 hostages taken in the attack of 7 October, which killed 1,200 people. But as David Cameron arrived in Doha, a recording of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was leaked in which he described Qatar's role as a mediator in the Gaza war as ""problematic"". The British foreign secretary dismissed the criticism and said that Qatar's role was ""helpful"". Qatar said it was appalled at the Israeli prime minister's remarks, which came just before this weekend's meeting in France, which will bring together William Burns, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, his Israeli counterpart, David Barnea and Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani. The Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel will also attend. The talks are aimed at freeing the Israeli captives and establishing a ceasefire, however wide the gap between Israel and Hamas's demands. Hosting Lord Cameron at the airbase was Lolwah Rashid Al-Khater, Qatar's Minister of State for International Cooperation. Some 12 tonnes of aid on the plane are from Qatar, and even this joint consignment is far from enough said the minister. ""On some days, these past days, even less than 100 [trucks make it into Gaza]. This situation is very difficult. There are many bottlenecks. And as a matter of fact, man-created obstacles, I should say. According to the 4th Geneva Convention article 59, it is the obligation on the occupying power, in this case it would be Israeli occupation, to ensure adequate levels of aid, supplies, and aid schemes,"" she told me. And in some cases, the wrong type of aid is being sent, the Qatari diplomat said. One recent consignment from a foreign donor was full of covid tests, she said. As the cargo plane filled with tents climbed slowly into the clear blue desert sky, Lolwah Al-Khater had one final point to make: ""It's very important to emphasise,"" she said, ""that aid can never and should never be substituting the need for an immediate and a permanent ceasefire. ""Unfortunately, some actors have been trying to promote that we need more aid without doing enough on the other front."" The situation inside Gaza is dire - at least 1.7m people have been displaced, some multiple times. The 285 family tents from Qatar and Britain will go to Unicef in Gaza and house up to five people in each tent. In recent days torrential rain there has made conditions even worse. The healthcare system is on its knees. From inside Gaza, a British doctor messaged me: ""People don't get operated upon because a) no beds b) no resources,"" he wrote. ""Lots of people are just left to die if the trauma burden is too high, on the floor in the emergency department, most of the time. We received 45 last night from Khan Younis, of which 70% died because of lack of resources. I think from a humanitarian perspective, it is just shocking to see the rapidity of the unfolding situation in front of my eyes.""

Israel reined in by ICJ rulings on Gaza - but will it obey?Published26 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"This was not a complete victory for South Africa, or the Palestinians. The ICJ did not order Israel to halt its military campaign - an implied recognition of Israel's right to self defence in the wake of the Hamas attacks on 7 October last year. But the UN's highest legal body has recognised that the situation in Gaza is catastrophic. Crucially, it said that situation was ""at serious risk of deteriorating further"" before the court delivers its final verdict on the charge of genocide, a process that could take years. As a result, it made several demands of Israel, broadly in line with most of the nine ""provisional measures"" demanded by South Africa. By large majorities the court's 17 judges ruled that Israel should do everything in its power to avoid killing Palestinians, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, creating intolerable living conditions in Gaza, or deliberately preventing Palestinian births. It also said Israel should do more to ""prevent and punish"" public incitement to genocide, citing examples by Israel's president and defence minister. And there was a call for ""immediate and effective measures"" to address the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Not a call for a ceasefire, then, but a series of demands that, if implemented, would drastically change the nature of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Israel vehemently rejects the allegation of genocide, arguing that it is Hamas that's responsible for putting Palestinian civilians in harm's way. It says Hamas operates inside and underneath Gaza's densely populated towns and refugee camps, making it virtually impossible for Israel to avoid killing civilians. And it says that it has gone to great lengths to warn civilians to avoid danger. The belief that Israel has ""the most moral army in the world"" is one almost universally held by the country's Jewish citizens. But since early October, Israel's actions have resulted in the displacement of around 85% of Gaza's 2.3 million population. Those who flee the fighting seeking refuge in squalid, overcrowded shelters, with dwindling healthcare and grossly inadequate humanitarian supplies. It was clear, soon after the court's American president Joan Donoghue began speaking, that the urgency of Gaza's plight was uppermost in the court's mind and that Israel had not succeeded in its bid to have the entire case thrown out. Judge Donoghue delivered a bleak summary of the suffering being experienced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. She said the plight of children was ""especially heartbreaking"". This is not the court's final ruling on genocide - that's likely to take several years. But the measures called for today are designed to offer the Palestinians of Gaza some measure of protection, while the judges consider South Africa's fundamental charge against Israel. Israel must now decide how to respond. The ICJ's rulings are binding, but there's no enforcement mechanism. Israel could choose to ignore the judges altogether. With diplomatic efforts now apparently concentrating on the possibility of a two-month ceasefire, and efforts still being made to improve the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, Israel may argue that it's already taking steps to meet the court's demands. But even if the situation eases - and there's no sign yet - the fact remains that Israel still stands accused of genocide, a case the ICJ believes is plausible and thus worthy of further detailed consideration. Israel, a country born out of the ashes of the world's worst example of genocide, must now live under this legal shadow until the court delivers its verdict.",2024-01-26T19:09:55.000Z

ICJ says Israel must prevent genocide in GazaPublished26 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The UN's top court has ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of telling it to halt the war. The highly anticipated hearing was part of a controversial case brought by South Africa. South Africa had asked the court to order Israel to stop military action straight away pending a decision on whether Israel has committed genocide. Israel has vehemently rejected the accusation as ""wholly unfounded"". Friday's hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague was the first time the judges have issued a ruling as part of the case which began two weeks ago. A verdict on the central allegation of genocide is expected to take much longer, possibly years. Although the court did not call for a halt to Israel's military action, as South Africa had asked it to do, it is being interpreted as a victory for those who support South Africa's case. The ICJ found it did have jurisdiction on the matter, and decided there was a plausible case under the 1948 Genocide Convention, and that the Palestinian population in Gaza was at real risk of irreparable damage. ""For the implementation of the international rule of law, the [ICJ's] decision is a momentous one,"" said South Africa in a statement. It called Friday's ruling a ""significant milestone in the search for justice for the Palestinian people"". The Palestinian foreign minister said the ruling showed that ""no state is above the law"", adding it ""should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not address the ruling directly but said ""Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to defend our country."" He said South Africa's allegation that Israel was committing genocide was ""not only false, it's outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it"". Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant dismissed the ruling, saying Israel ""does not need to be lectured on morality in order to distinguish between terrorists and the civilian population in Gaza"". A spokesman for Hamas, the Palestinian group whose unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October triggered the war, called the outcome ""important"", saying it contributed to ""isolating Israel"", Reuters news agency reported. The ICJ ordered Israel to take a series of measures against potentially genocidal acts against Palestinians in Gaza. These include measures not only on the battlefield but also against public incitement to genocide. It also ordered Israel to take ""immediate and effective measures"" to enable the provision of aid to people in Gaza. The court said Israel must report on its compliance to the court within one month. Although orders issued by the ICJ are legally binding, it does not have the power to enforce them. Israel is not expected to commit itself to the orders. More than 26,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza by Israel's bombardment since 7 October, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel launched its offensive after waves of Hamas gunmen burst through the border early that day, killing about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages. Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.",2024-01-26T16:54:33.000Z

Gaza war: ICJ to rule on call for Israel to stop military actionPublished26 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The UN's top court is to decide whether to issue emergency measures ordering Israel to halt its operations in Gaza. The session of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Friday is part of a case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel is committing genocide. Both countries testified when the case opened two weeks ago. Israel has vehemently rejected the allegation. A ruling against Israel is not enforceable by the court but would be politically significant. More than 25,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed and tens of thousands injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, since Israel began its offensive, triggered by an unprecedented attack on Israel by the group. The Hamas attack on 7 October killed about 1,200 people, mainly civilians. The attackers also took about 250 people back to Gaza as hostages. South Africa, which strongly supports the Palestinians, asked the court to issue nine provisional measures, including a halt to military activity by Israel, while it considers the accusation of genocide. A ruling on the latter is not expected for a long time, possibly years. Israel reacted with outrage to the genocide allegation, accusing South Africa of distorting the truth. It said it had a right to defend itself and was targeting Hamas fighters, not Palestinian civilians. It asked the judges to dismiss South Africa's request which it said was based on ""grossly distorted"" and baseless allegations of a non-existent genocide. In reaching a ruling on Friday, the 17 judges - 15 permanent justices, plus one each from South Africa and Israel - must answer two questions: Also, the judges are not limited to South Africa's specific requests. The panel could simply instruct Israel to ensure its actions comply with international law and to ensure that it does not do anything to impede deliveries of food, water or medicines. The ICJ, though, only has the power to issue advisory opinions. And while its rulings are in theory legally binding, they are not enforceable by the court. If Friday's ruling go against Israel, it is almost certain to be ignored. It would, however, place additional political pressure on Israel to work towards a ceasefire, and will intensify pressure on Israel's strongest international allies to do what they can behind the scenes to find a resolution and guarantee humanitarian assistance gets to where it is needed.

Qatar 'appalled' by reported criticism from Israel's NetanyahuPublished25 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Qatar has said it is ""appalled"" by remarks attributed to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he apparently called its role as a mediator in the Gaza war ""problematic"". Israeli TV broadcast what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling the families of hostages held by Hamas that ""you don't hear me thanking Qatar"". ""They have leverage... because they finance [Hamas],"" he reportedly adds. Qatar said the comments, if true, were ""irresponsible"" but ""not surprising"". The tiny Gulf emirate has had high-level contacts with Israel since the 1990s, but they have never officially established diplomatic relations. Qatar has long championed the Palestinian cause and hosts political leaders of Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and other countries. It has also provided hundreds of millions of dollars of aid for Gaza, which has been subject to a crippling blockade by Israel and Egypt since 2006, when Hamas won legislative elections. The blockade was tightened the following year when Hamas reinforced its power in Gaza by violently ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) forces. Since 2018, Israeli governments have allowed Qatar to pay the wages of tens of thousands of civil servants in Gaza's Hamas-run government, financially support the poorest families, and fund fuel deliveries for the territory's sole power plant. Qatar insists the funding was only for civilian and humanitarian purposes. The policy sparked controversy within Israel, with critics warning it was helping Hamas to stay in power and fund its military activities. Mr Netanyahu - who has been re-elected to office for all but one of the past 15 years - saidit was a way to dissuade attacks on Israel and prevent a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Following the cross-border attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages,he dismissed as a ""big lie""accusations that he had also encouraged the payments in order to strengthen Hamas at the expense of the PA. Israel responded to the attacks by launching a large-scale military campaign in Gaza with the aim of destroying Hamas. More than 25,000 people have been killed in the fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Qatar used its ties with Hamas to help broker a week-long pause in the fighting in late November, during which 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed in exchange for some 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The emirate has for weeks been trying to broker a new ceasefire, with Gaza's humanitarian crisis worsening and with the Israeli government coming under mounting domestic pressure to secure the release of the remaining hostages. On Tuesday, Israel's Channel 12 TV released what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling hostages' families: ""You don't hear me thanking Qatar. Have you noticed?"" ""Why? Because for me it is essentially no different from the UN or Red Cross, and in a certain sense is even more problematic - I have no illusions about them."" ""But I'm ready to use any actor right now that helps me bring [the hostages] home,"" he added. Israel has accused the UN and Red Cross of not doing enough to support the hostages or to help get them freed. The prime minister purportedly said the reason Qatar could help was because of ""leverage"" over Hamas. ""Why do they have leverage? Because they finance them."" On Wednesday night,Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""These remarks if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising."" ""For months, and following a successful mediation last year that led to the release of more than 100 hostages, Qatar has been engaged in regular dialogue with the negotiating parties including Israeli institutions, attempting to establish the framework for a new hostage agreement and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza."" He added that Mr Netanyahu appeared to be undermining the mediation efforts ""for reasons that appear to serve his political career"". In response, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X: ""Qatar is a country that supports and finances terrorism. It is Hamas's patron and is largely responsible for the massacre of Israeli citizens by Hamas."" ""One thing is certain: Qatar will not have one iota of involvement in Gaza on the day after the war,"" he added. There was no immediate comment from Qatar's foreign ministry. Meanwhile US President Biden is sending the director of the CIA to try to broker a new deal on hostages held in Gaza, the BBC's US partner CBS has confirmed. William Burns will meet the Qatari PM and directors of Mossad, Israel's secret service, in France. Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas.

Khan Younis: UN says 12 killed at Gaza shelter as fighting ragesPublished25 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"At least 12 people were killed and 75 injured when a UN facility sheltering civilians was struck in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency says. UNRWA said two shells hit its Khan Younis Training Centre during fighting in the city's western outskirts. Its commissioner condemned the ""blatant disregard of basic rules of war"". Israel's military said it had ruled out that the incident was the result of an air or artillery strike by its forces. It added that it was reviewing Israeli operations nearby and examining the possibility that it was ""Hamas fire"". Israeli troops have been battling Hamas fighters as they advance into western Khan Younis, a day after the military said it had completely encircled the city. Clashes and bombardment around the city's two main hospitals have also left thousands of patients, staff and others unable to leave. The conflict was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 others taken hostage. More than 25,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. An estimated 1.7 million people - nearly three-quarters of the population - have also been displaced by the past 12 weeks of fighting and many of them are sheltering inside UN facilities or near them. The Khan Younis Training Centre is one of the largest UNRWA shelters, with between 30,000 and 40,000 people said to be living inside its grounds. UNRWA said the compound was clearly marked, that its co-ordinates had been shared with Israeli authorities, and that it and the civilians inside had to be protected under international law. However, at least six displaced people were killed and many more injured when the training centre was struck on Monday during intense fighting in the surrounding area,according to the agency. On Wednesday afternoon, UNRWA's Gaza director, Thomas White, said a building at the facility that was housing 800 people from northern Gaza was hit. In an interview with the BBC from Rafah in the evening, he said the building was struck by ""two tank rounds"" and that at least nine people were killed. On Thursday morning, Mr White issued a statement saying the building was ""hit by two shells and caught fire"". Twelve people had now been confirmed dead and 15 of the injured were in a critical condition, he added. ""A number of missions to assess the situation were denied. Yesterday evening, the UN finally managed to reach the affected areas to treat trauma patients, bring medical supplies and evacuate injured patients to Rafah."" He added: ""The situation in Khan Younis underscores a consistent failure to uphold the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law: distinction, proportionality and precautions in carrying out attacks. This is unacceptable and abhorrent and must stop."" In response to UNRWA's initial reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""After an examination of our operational systems, the IDF has currently ruled out that this incident is a result of an aerial or artillery strike by the IDF."" ""A thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is under way,"" it added. ""The IDF is also examining the possibility that the strike was a result of Hamas fire."" Vedant Patel of the US state department repeated Washington's calls for the protection of civilians in Gaza. ""We deplore today's attack on the UN's Khan Younis training centre,"" she said, and called it ""incredibly concerning"". The IDF also said on Wednesday afternoon that its troops had ""launched a divisional manoeuvre on West Khan Younis"" that was targeting Hamas ""outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centres"". ""Dismantling Hamas' military framework in western Khan Yunis is the heart of the logic behind the operation."" The IDF added that Hamas ""exploits the civilian population, exploits shelters and hospitals"" - something the group has denied. Gaza's health ministry meanwhile accused the IDF of ""isolating hospitals in Khan Younis and carrying out massacres in the western area of the city"". The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said the al-Amal Hospital, which it runs, and its local headquarters were under ""siege"" by Israeli forces, trapping patients, wounded people and an estimated 13,000 displaced people. The organisation alleged that three displaced people were killedafter being targeted at the entrance to the headquarters on Wednesday morning. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) warned on Tuesday nightthat its staff inside the nearby Nasser Medical Complex - the largest hospital still partly functioning in Gaza - had reported bombing and heavy gunfire nearby. ""They are currently unable to evacuate along with the thousands of people in the hospital, including 850 patients, due to roads to and from the building being either inaccessible or too dangerous."" The IDF has issued evacuation orders for western parts of Khan Younis, including those where Nasser and al-Amal are located. The UN estimates there are about 88,000 residents and 425,000 displaced people in the area. Mr White told the BBC that tens of thousands more people were now on the move, heading south to Rafah, on the border with Egypt, where as many as 1.4 million are already sheltering. In another incident in Khan Younis on Tuesday,a cameraman for the UK's ITV News filmed a Palestinian civilian being shot dead on a main road about 1.7km (1 mile) south of the UNRWA shelter. Five men are seen walking towards the combat zone holding a white flag, before there is a burst of gunfire and one of them falls to the ground. It was not clear who opened fire. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was asked in the Parliament on Wednesday whether such pictures would prompt him to push for a ceasefire in Gaza. He replied: ""No-one wants to see this conflict go on for a moment longer than is necessary and we do want to see an immediate and sustained humanitarian pause."" Efforts involving several countries to try to reach a ceasefire are ongoing, with one plan said to include a month-long truce and phased release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. But both Israel and Hamas appear to have rejected proposals, and hopes of any progress have been dampened. Egypt's President, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, meanwhile accused Israel of deliberately holding up aid deliveries at the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing as ""a form of pressure on the Gaza Strip and its people over the conflict and the release of hostages"". However, an Israeli defence ministry agency co-ordinating the deliveries with Egypt and the UN rejected the claim, insisting that ""there is no limit to the amount of aid that can enter Gaza"". Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.",2024-01-25T08:30:27.000Z

A jobs crisis in India is driving workers to IsraelPublished25 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"On a frigid morning last week, hundreds of men, wrapped up in woollens and blankets, queued up inside a sprawling university campus in India's northern state of Haryana. The men, carrying backpacks and lunch bags, were queueing up for practical exams for construction jobs - plastering workers, steel fixers, tile setters - in Israel. For those like Ranjeet Kumar - a university educated, qualified teacher who has only ever managed to find work casually as a painter, steel fixer, labourer, automobile workshop technician, and a surveyor for a non-profit - it is a chance too good to pass up. The 31-year-old has never managed to earn more than 700 rupees per day, despite having two degrees and having cleared a government ""trade test"" to work as a ""diesel mechanic"". In contrast, the jobs in Israel are paying around 137,000 rupees ($1,648; £1,296) a month, along with accommodation and medical benefits. Perhaps unsurprisingly then, Mr Kumar, who got a passport last year, is eager to secure a job as a steel fixer in Israel to support his seven-member family. ""There are no secure jobs here. Prices are going up. I am not financially stable even after graduating nine years ago,"" he said. According toreportsquoting officials, Israel plans to bring in 70,000 workers from China and India and other countries to boost its construction sector, which has been struggling since the 7 October Hamas attack. A labour shortage had arisen after Israel barred some 80,000 Palestinian workers following the attack, reports add. Some 10,000 workers from India will reportedly be hired. Uttar Pradesh and Haryana are accepting job applications, with the Maharshi Dayanand University in Haryana's Rohtak city hosting tests for a few thousand applicants from across the country.  (The Israeli embassy in Delhi declined to comment on the subject.) Like Mr Kumar, the job seekers in the queue are part of India's sprawling and precarious informal economy, working without formal contracts and benefits. Like Mr Kumar, many hold college degrees but are struggling to land secure jobs, and find themselves in casual construction jobs, earning up to 700 rupees a day for about 15-20 days a month. They carried their resumes - ""I  am a good team player with my team,"" said one. Many juggle multiple jobs to augment earnings. Some attribute their financial setbacks and limited prospects to India's 2016 currency ban - ordemonetisation- and the strict 2020 Covidlockdown. Others complain aboutquestion paper leaksin government exams. Many claim to have tried to pay agents toillegally enter the US and Canadabut found it difficult to gather the money. All this, they said, had prompted them to look for a secure, more lucrative overseas job, ""never mind the risk of working in a war zone"". Sanjay Verma, who also graduated in 2014, obtained a technical education diploma, and spent six years attempting over a dozen government exams for positions in the police, paramilitary and railways. (""There are very few jobs, and the demand is 20 times their number,"" he said). In 2017, he failed to pay up 140,000 rupees to an agent for a promised 900 euro-per-month farm job in Italy. Parbat Singh Chauhan said he had slipped back into uncertainty after the twin shocks of the currency ban and the pandemic lockdown. The 35-year-old from Rajasthan worked as a emergency ambulance driver, earning 8,000 rupees a month for a 12-hour daily job. He also undertook small construction contracts in his village, and even bought six cars for taxi rentals. Mr Chauhan, like many others, commenced his journey after completing high school. He began as a newspaper hawker in school, earning 300 rupees a month. After his mother died, he worked in a clothes shop. When he didn't find a decent job, he did a course in repairing mobile phones. ""But that didn't help much,"" he said. For five to seven years until 2016, his fortunes improved: he drove an ambulance, managed small village construction contracts and ran his fleet of taxis. ""But the lockdown [in 2020] destroyed me. I had to sell my cars as I couldn't afford the mortgage. Now I am back to driving an ambulance and taking small government construction contracts,"" he said. There are others like Ram Avatar, a 40-year-old tile setter from Haryana with two decades of experience. Faced with the challenges of a rising cost of living and stagnant wages, he worries about funding the higher education of his children - his daughter is pursuing a bachelor's in science, while his son aspires to become a chartered accountant. He tried for jobs in Dubai, Italy, and Canada but couldn't afford the exorbitant fees demanded by agents. With expenses for rent, his children's coaching, and food, he says he's struggling. ""We know there's a war going on in Israel. I am not afraid of death. We can die here too,"" he said. Then there's the rising tide of aspiration. Harsh Jat, 28, earned a humanities degree in 2018. Initially a mechanic in a car factory, he later spent two years as a police vehicle driver, growing weary of dealing with ""intoxicated people misusing the emergency line"". Subsequently, he worked as a pub bouncer in the upscale suburb of Gurgaon, earning 40,000 rupees. ""These jobs, they throw you out after two years and there's no security,"" he told me. Mr Jat, jobless, returned to his family's eight-acre farm. ""But nobody wants to farm now,"" he said. He tried government jobs - clerk, policeman - without success. He said young men in his village have paid agents 6m rupees each to illegally enter US and Canada. They were sending remittances home, funding their families' acquisition of fancy cars. ""I want to go abroad and get a good, well-paying job because when I have a child he will ask me, 'why does my neighbour have a swanky SUV, and we don't'?"" said Mr Jat. ""I am not scared of the war."" The jobs scene in India presents a mixed picture. Government data from itsPeriodic Labour Force Survey, shows a declining trend in joblessness - from 6% in 2017-2018 to 4% in 2021-2022. Santosh Mehrotra, a development economist and visiting professor at the University of Bath, attributes this to the inclusion of unpaid work as jobs in government data. ""It's not that jobs are not happening. It's just that organised jobs are barely growing and at the same time, the number of young people looking for jobs is increasing,"" said Prof Mehrotra. Unemployment is falling but remains high, according to the latestState of Working Indiareport, by Azim Premji University. After stagnating since the 1980s, the share of workers with regular wages or salaried work had begun increasing in 2004 - 18 to 25% for men and 10 to 25% for women, according to the report. Since 2019, however, the pace of regular wage jobs had decreased due to a ""growth slowdown and the pandemic"". The report found that above 15% of graduates - and a massive 42% for graduates under 25 years old - had no jobs in the country after the pandemic. ""This group has aspirations for higher incomes, and they don't want to do insecure gig work. This group is trading that extreme risk [of going to Israel] for higher incomes and some level of reduced precarity,"" said Rosa Abraham, a labour economist with Azim Premji University. One of them is Ankit Upadhyay from Uttar Pradesh. He said he paid an agent, got a visa and spent eight years in Kuwait working as a steel fixer before losing his job during the pandemic. ""I have no fear left. I want to work in Israel. I don't mind the risks there. There's no job security at home,"" he said.",2024-01-25T00:21:57.000Z

Tahir Ali: Labour MP apologises over PM 'blood on hands' remarkPublished24 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Labour MP has apologised after saying Rishi Sunak had ""the blood of thousands of innocent people on his hands"" over the Israel-Gaza conflict. Tahir Ali made the comment in Parliament, as he challenged the prime minister about the UK's stance on the war. He apologised shortly afterwards, after being asked to do so by Labour's chief whip. But he added he did not ""resile from my strongly held views"" on the conflict. In a social media post, Mr Ali, the MP for Birmingham Hall Green, said he was sorry for ""the way in which I described"" Mr Sunak in his question. The Labour leadership has publicly distanced itself from his remarks, with a party spokesman telling reporters they were ""clearly inappropriate"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Ali said ""recently released documents"" revealed the Foreign Office had concerns over Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law in its ongoing military campaign in Gaza. It appeared to be a reference to documents that have emerged as part of a legal challenge to the business department's decision to continue arms export licences to Israel. The Guardian reported last week that an internal Foreign Office assessment in late November had raised concerns over Israel's bombing campaign, and how it was deciding whether to grant access to aid workers. The licences were eventually continued after Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron advised they should, but be kept under review. Mr Ali said the documents had been ""hidden from Parliament"" whilst Mr Sunak had ""boldly stated his confidence in Israel's respect for international law"". He added that South Africa'scase at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, had revealed ""the scale of Israel's war crimes in Gaza"". ""Is it now not the time for the prime minister to admit that he has the blood of thousands of innocent people on his hands, and for him to commit to demanding an immediate ceasefire and an ending of UK's arms trade with Israel?"" he asked. But in a post three hours later on X, formerly Twitter, he issued an apology over his intervention. It is understood Labour's chief whip Sir Alan Campbell spoke to him after PMQs and asked him to apologise. Mr Ali added: ""While I do not resile from my strongly held views on the situation in the Middle East, I would like to apologise for the way in which I described the prime minister in my question"". ""We all have a responsibility to be respectful in the language that we use, even when discussing difficult and, at times, sensitive issues."" Israel launched its bombing and ground offensive in Gaza with the declared aim of destroying Hamas, after its gunmen killed around 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage in an unprecedented attack in October. At least 25,700 people have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200.

Mediators push for Gaza ceasefire deal but gaps remain between Israel and HamasPublished24 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"There is huge pressure for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Up to now, weeks of mediation by Qatar and Egypt with US involvement have brought no breakthrough. But in recent days, more reports have suggested ""serious"" progress is being made in indirect talks held with delegations from Israel and Hamas. At the same time, on Wednesday, unnamed Israeli officials quoted by the Israeli media are cautioning that there is a ""very large"" gap on fundamental issues. From what the BBC has learnt, the main block appears to boil down to major differences over how to bring a complete end to the war. A senior Palestinian official, who is familiar with ongoing talks, told us that Cairo had laid out a new five-stage framework to Hamas officials. This is said to start with a humanitarian truce, during which Hamas would release the remaining civilians it is holding hostage, including women, children and the elderly. In exchange, some Palestinians would be freed from Israeli jails and the amount of desperately needed aid going into Gaza would increase. Finally, there would be a long-term ceasefire and complete cessation of hostilities. The handover of the remaining Israeli hostages would be accompanied by further Palestinian inmates being allowed out of prison, according to our source. The indication is that the release of more high-profile Palestinian prisoners would be sought in exchange for the captive Israeli soldiers. The Palestinian official said that Israel was insisting on keeping its forces on the ground until the last stage of the process. We were told that Hamas has demanded that the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops and return of displaced residents to their homes takes place earlier. Other international media reports have said that while Hamas is demanding a full ceasefire, Israeli negotiators are only prepared to accept a pause that would last weeks, but could be extended as conditions evolved. At a news conference on Tuesday, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed al-Ansari said: ""We have presented ideas to both sides, we are getting a constant stream of replies, and that in its own right is a cause for optimism."" Later, White House spokesperson John Kirby said that the US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk was in Cairo and would continue ""active"" discussions in the region on a new deal to bring home hostages and secure a humanitarian pause. ""The conversations are very sober and serious,"" Mr Kirby told journalists. During a week-long ceasefire in late November, 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed out of more than 250 kidnapped in the shocking Hamas cross-border attacks of 7 October, which triggered the war in Gaza. In return, some 240 Palestinian prisoners were released. Israel and Hamas blamed each other for causing the collapse of the truce by rejecting the terms to extend the daily release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian detainees. Now, on both sides, inevitably, there are major differences between what is publicly declared and what may be negotiable. This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeated that nothing short of ""absolute victory"" in Gaza can be accepted. Meanwhile, many commentators have suggested that totally destroying Hamas - which has been governing the territory for a decade and a half - is not realistic. However, one thing that Israel and its Western allies are unlikely to compromise on is that Hamas leaders must be removed from power in Gaza, to ensure that there can be no repeat of the attacks three months ago, which killed about 1,200 people. Interestingly, there have been unconfirmed media reports this week that as part of a ceasefire and hostage release proposal, Israel had made an offer to allow top Hamas leaders in Gaza to relocate to other countries. Hamas claimed it had rejected such a proposal. With more than 25,000 people now killed in Gaza, according to local health officials, and a catastrophic humanitarian situation, international calls for a ceasefire have become much harder for Israel to ignore. Meanwhile, noisy protests and rallies by the families of Israeli hostages ensure their demand to bring home their loved ones has become a priority of domestic politics. They have overwhelming public sympathy. The latest Israeli reports denying that negotiations with Hamas over a potential hostage release deal are progressing will be a cause for general anxiety. Unnamed diplomatic officials are being quoted by various Israeli media saying that suggestions of positive developments are ""fake"". They blame Hamas for a failure to compromise. With mediators no doubt rushing to try to shore up the process, the most encouraging sign may be that neither Israel nor Hamas has yet indicated it is abandoning the latest rounds of indirect talks. Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200.

Iraq condemns 'irresponsible' US air strikes on Iran-backed groupsPublished24 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Iraqi government has strongly condemned US strikes which targeted sites used by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq on Wednesday. A spokesperson for Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said they ""blatantly"" violated his country's sovereignty. The US said its ""proportionate"" attacks had targeted ""Iran-affiliated groups"". The paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) said the ""treacherous"" US action killed one of their fighters. The PMF, which is dominated by Iran-backed Shia Muslim militias, said a number of other fighters were injured in strikes on their bases in al-Qaim, a town on the Syrian border in western Anbar province, and in Jurf al-Nasr, in the central province of Babil. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes on three facilities belonging to the Kataib Hezbollah militia and other groups were ""in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks"" against US and other international forces in Iraq and Syria. Major General Yehia Rasool, a spokesman for Prime Minister Sudani, said in a statement that the US action was ""contributing to a reckless escalation"". ""This unacceptable act undermines years of co-operation... at a time when the region is already grappling with the danger of expanding conflict, the repercussions of the aggression on Gaza,"" he added, referring to the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas. He added that Iraq would treat the US operations ""as acts of aggression"" against its people on their land, and urged the international community to help restore peace. Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Iraq national security adviser Qassem al-Aaraji said the US action would ""not help bring calm"". He added that ""the US should pile on pressure for a halt to the Israeli offensive in Gaza rather than targeting and bombing the bases of an Iraqi national body"". Last week, four US military personnel were injured in a ballistic missile and rocket attack on Iraq's Al Asad air base, in Anbar province. The Pentagon said on Tuesday that they had returned to duty and that there was no significant damage to facilities. The US military's Central Command (Centcom) said an Iran-backed militia targeted the air base, which hosts American troops. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed it was behind that attack. The umbrella group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq. It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks. Mr Austin said: ""We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region. We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities."" ""We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks."" In a separate statement, Centcom said the strikes were carried out at 00:15 local time on Wednesday (21:15 GMT Tuesday). ""These strikes targeted [Kataib Hezbollah] headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV capabilities,"" it added, without mentioning their locations. Kataib Hezbollah, or Brigades of the Party of God, is a powerful Iraqi Shia militia that receives financial and military support from Iran. It is believed to have strong links with Iran's Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. Since 2009, the US has designated the group as a terrorist organisation, accusing it of attacking US and Iraqi forces in Iraq on behalf of Iran, and of threatening Iraq's stability. Saturday's attack on Al Asad air base followed a US drone strike in Baghdad earlier this month in which a high-ranking PMF commander was killed. US troops in Iraq and Syria have been attacked dozens of times by Iran-aligned fighters since the war in Gaza started in October. The US and UK have also carried out strikes onYemen's Iran-backed Houthi movementin response to its missile and drone attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Meanwhile,Iran has carried out a number of missile strikes over the last week against targets in Syria, Iraq and Pakistan, which it claimed were linked to the Islamic State group, Israel and a Baloch separatist group respectively. Last Saturday, Iranaccused Israel of carrying out an air strike in the Syrian capital, Damascus, which killed five senior members of Iran's security forces.",2024-01-24T11:52:34.000Z

Khan Younis: Israel says forces have encircled Gaza's second cityPublished23 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israeli military says its ground forces have encircled Khan Younis, the southern Gaza Strip's largest city. Troops have also reportedly advanced deeper into remaining parts of the city, where they believe Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with hostages. Residents said tanks had shut the last road out of the city to the Mediterranean coast, effectively stopping them from fleeing southwards. There was also intense fighting around the city's two main hospitals. It came as funerals took place for some of the24 Israeli soldiers killed on Mondayon the deadliest day for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since the start of its ground offensive in Gaza 12 weeks ago. At least 195 Palestinians were also killed in Gaza over the previous 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry says more than 25,400 people have been killed - mostly children and women - during the war between Hamas and Israel. It was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 250 others taken hostage. Israeli ground forces expanded their operation into southern Gaza in early December, after largely taking control of Hamas strongholds in the north. Within days they were said to have reached the ""heart"" of Khan Younis, where hundreds of thousands of people who had fled northern areas were sheltering. But the troops have since faced fierce resistance from Hamas's Khan Younis Brigade. It is considered to be one of the two strongest in the group, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries. The Israeli operation has expanded and intensified in recent days, with dozens of people reported killed in air and artillery strikes on Monday alone as tanks pushed into the west and centre of the city. On Tuesday, the IDF put out a statement saying that over the past day its troops had ""carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Yunis and deepened the operation in the area"". The troops had ""engaged in close-quarters combat, directed [air] strikes, and used intelligence to co-ordinate fire, resulting in the elimination of dozens of terrorists"", it added. The IDF also ordered residents of western Khan Younis to move immediately to the al-Mawasi area, on the Mediterranean coast, for their own safety. However, some witnesses said tanks had blocked the road leading there, preventing them from joining the estimated million people currently sheltering to the south in Rafah, on the border with Egypt. ""I am trying to leave for Rafah but the tanks are now very near to the coast and are firing toward the west,"" Shaban, an electrical engineer with four children, told Reuters news agency. The World Health Organization meanwhile said it was deeply concerned by reports of attacks on hospitals in Khan Younis. On Tuesday,the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said a civilian had been killed by an Israeli drone at the entrance of Al-Amal Hospital, which it runs, and that others had been injured when shells struck its nearby headquarters. ""The situation remains extremely dangerous. Early this morning, there was direct artillery shelling of the Palestine Red Crescent's headquarters on the fourth floor. Israeli drones did not stop firing at people at al-Amal Hospital,"" spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told the BBC from Ramallah. ""[There is] panic and fear among thousands of displaced people who are taking shelter inside our facilities."" There was no immediate comment from the IDF, but it has previously accused Hamas fighters of embedding themselves among the civilian population and operating in and around medical facilities. Ms Farsakh also said ambulances were ""facing significant challenges to reach wounded people and transport them to hospitals"", adding that they were now being told to take critical cases to Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza. And she warned that Al-Amal and the nearby Nasser Medical Complex - the largest of the 14 hospitals still partly working in Gaza - were ""overwhelmed and overcrowded"". Dr Haytham Ahmad, who works in Nasser's emergency department, told the BBC that multiple amputations were being performed, and that in some cases, patients were not being given anaesthetic because of a shortage of supplies. ""These cases have severe crush injuries and there is just some skin and muscle still connected. We try to use limited anaesthetic in this situation,"" he said. A World Health Organization spokesman said Nasser was ""now basically besieged"" and that there was ""no way in and out"" for its 400 patients, as well as the medical staff treating them and displaced civilians. Gaza's health ministry alleged that Israeli forces had fired ""heavily on the upper floors of the specialised surgery building and the emergency building"" of the hospital. One video filmed by a Palestinian journalist appeared to show gunfire hitting the hospital's western corner, while in another clipsmoke is seen rising from an area to the south. The IDF told AFP news agency that it was ""not aware of the event"". Later, UN Secretary General António Guterres said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was ""appalling"" and that the entire population was ""enduring destruction at a scale and speed without parallel in recent history"". He also once again appealed for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said it was ""engaging in serious discussions with both sides"" on a potential deal, and a Palestinian official told the BBC that a Hamas delegation had arrived in Cairo on Tuesday morning to ""discuss new proposals"" with Egypt's intelligence minister. Israel has not denied that it has proposed a two-month truce, involving the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. But there are reports that has already been rejected by Hamas, which demands a permanent ceasefire. Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200.

Israel-Gaza war: IDF says 24 soldiers killed in Gaza in one dayPublished23 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israeli army says 24 of its soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday - the deadliest day for its forces since their ground operation began. That includes 21 reservists who died in an explosion likely caused by mines that Israeli forces had placed in two buildings to demolish them, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. The IDF later said rocket-propelled grenade fire triggered the explosion. ""A militant squad surprised the force with RPG fire,"" a spokesman said. ""The first rocket hit one of the buildings in which explosives had been laid out. The hit apparently led to the explosion that caused the collapse of the building and the building next to it,"" Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari added. According to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, 195 Palestinians have been killed in the past day. In an earlier briefing, Rear Admiral Hagari said the reservists were killed in central Gaza at around 16:00 (14:00 GMT) on Monday - close to the kibbutz of Kissufim on the Israeli side of the border. They were involved in an operation to allow for residents of southern Israel to safely return to their homes after tens of thousands were evacuated after the Hamas attack on 7 October. The first funerals for those killed in the explosion have been held at Mount Herzl in a rainy Jerusalem. Many of the mourners wore military uniforms and the scene was full of blue and white Israeli flags. Israel's military had already confirmed that three officers were killed in a separate attack in southern Gaza on Monday. The country's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that despite its suffering, his country would push on with its offensive until it had ""absolute victory."" Elsewhere in Gaza, there has been fierce fighting by three hospitals in Khan Younis in the south, which is crowded with displaced people. The IDF announced it has completely encircled the city, which has been a main focus of its ground offensive targeting Hamas. Israel believes that the group's leaders may be hiding there and that it may also be where some Israeli hostages are being held. According to the IDF, dozens of local gunmen were killed in its operation and its forces found rockets in rocket-launchers ready to fire, as well as tunnel shafts and a large number of weapons. The Palestinians said that women and children have been killed in the latest fighting in the city. They added that Israeli blockades and the storming of hospitals since Monday had left the wounded and dead beyond the reach of rescuers. The dead were being buried inside the grounds of Nasser hospital because it has been unsafe to leave in order to reach the cemetery. It is said that Israeli forces stormed another hospital, Al-Khair - which is in the al-Mawasi area to the west - and arrested staff. Israel launched the war with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after waves of its gunmen killed around 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage in the unprecedented attack. According to the IDF website, 217 soldiers have been killed since the beginning of Israel's ground invasion on 27 October out of a total of 552 killed since 7 October. At least 25,490 people - mainly women and children - have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

UK not seeking confrontation with Houthis - SunakPublished23 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The UK will not hesitate to take further military action against Houthi targets in Yemen if the group continues Red Sea attacks, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has told MPs. Mr Sunak said the UK was not seeking confrontation with the Iran-backed group, but would continue to act in self-defence. It follows overnight strikes with the US in Yemen. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he backed the ""targeted action"". Four RAF Typhoons and two Voyager tankers took part in a second wave of joint US-UK action against the Houthis on Monday night, following previous raids on 11 January. They targeted two military sites used to support attacks on shipping north of Yemen's capital, Sanaa. The prime minister said all intended targets were destroyed. Addressing the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Sunak said: ""We are not seeking a confrontation. We urge the Houthis and those who enable them to stop these illegal and unacceptable attacks. ""But, if necessary, the United Kingdom will not hesitate to respond again in self-defence."" ""Maximum care"" was taken to protect civilians in the strikes, he added. No civilians have died as a result of the strikes. Sir Keir was not briefed beforehand, but Downing Street said he and Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle were informed while British fighter jets were in the air at about 22:00 on Monday. Since November, the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The group says it is targeting ships linked to Israel in response to the military ground operation in Gaza. However, many of the vessels which have been attacked have no connection with Israel. Yemen's internationally recognised government, which is now based in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia, has condemned Houthi attacks. What was originally intended to be a short, sharp shock for the Houthis has now descended into a repetitive tit-for-tat. The latest strikes will have made a dent in their arsenal. But the Houthis, who took over much of Yemen 10 years ago, have a large supply of missiles and drones and show every sign of continuing their attacks on shipping, undeterred by the eight US-led air strikes so far this year. The US and UK have little choice but to continue hitting Houthi targets as long as their attacks continue - to give up now would be tantamount to ceding control of a crucial global shipping route to a proscribed terror group backed by Iran. So far, the strikes have been precise and calibrated with minimal human casualties, but that may change. The longer these exchanges carry on, the greater the risk of escalation. There is a real risk that in due course Yemeni civilians may die in these retaliatory air strikes, which could ignite a wave of anti-western anger across the wider Middle East. The Houthis have vowed vengeance against US and British interests, believing they have God on their side. They have survived eight years of civil war and countless airstrikes by their neighbour, Saudi Arabia. They have strategic patience, claiming they will outlast their western adversaries. They also accuse the US and UK of supporting Israel with its military action against them. But Mr Sunak said there was ""no link between our actions of self-defence in the Red Sea and the situation in Israel and Gaza"". ""Those who make that link do the Houthis' work for them,"" he told MPs. There have been at least 12 further attacks by the Houthis since 11 January, including on Monday night ahead of the latest strikes. Incidents have increased in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since the first wave of US-UK strikes. But the prime minister insisted the latest British military action had worked to ""degrade capability"", though noted there ""may be a difference between reducing and eliminating"" the threat. ""The targets are specifically selected on the basis of intelligence, military sites which impact the security and safety of seafarers and shipping, and to that end I'm confident the strikes are being carried out in a way that's effective and achieving their aim,"" he told MPs. Mr Sunak said action against the Houthis had been a ""last resort"" and only after repeated warnings had been ignored, adding that the UK in both waves of attacks had acted in order to ""protect innocent lives and preserve the freedom of navigation"". The government's aim is to stop the illegal sale of weapons to the Houthis and impose sanctions to cut off the group's financial resources, he added. The government has published the legal advice it received for the operation, which concluded the strikes were legal under international law. Sir Keir Starmer backed the strikes and said attacks on vessels needed to stop. ""They are designed to destabilise us so we must stand united and strong, they bring danger to ordinary civilians who are working hard at sea, so we must protect them, and they aim to disrupt the flow of goods, food and medicines, so we must not let them go unaddressed,"" he said. A ""general debate"" on military action in the region will take place in the Commons on Wednesday. MPs will not be asked to consider and vote on a specific motion. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who has called for a vote, said his party accepted the case for the strikes but that there had been ""remarkably little clarity about what the next steps are and when the UK's objectives will be judged to have been fulfilled"". Downing Street has defended the decision not to consult Parliament first, arguing that the government was ""acting with precedent"" and that ""there isn't a requirement to hold a vote"". Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron will be visiting the region this week.",2024-01-23T17:26:37.000Z

'I go to sleep a dead man' - father's pain at daughter's captivity in GazaPublished23 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"On 7 October Eli Albag's daughter Liri was taken into Gaza as a hostage following the Hamas attacks on Israel that day. ""I wake up in the morning alive and go to sleep dead. Each day,"" says Eli as he tries to cope with the pain of 18-year-old Liri's ordeal, and his own inability to keep her safe. Standing outside the Houses of Parliament, he holds two images of Liri, before and after she was taken captive. The contrast is heartbreaking. In the latter - a still from a video made by Hamas after the capture - Liri looks dishevelled, with dirt pictured on her face and hoodie. ""I couldn't sleep for three days because I see my daughter in shock,"" Mr Albag says. ""I want to show to the world. This is the same girl, it is not different girls. This is Liri freedom, a girl of peace and love,"" he says pointing to the first picture. ""And this is Liri in the hands of the Hamas. You see the difference. You can see in the eyes and the face. ""She see the dead, she see people with guns on her head and she see murdered girls in front of her for two hours."" Mr Albag is one of four relatives of hostages who have come to London to lobby the UK Government to put pressure on Qatar, which is involved in talks to release the hostages but also hosts a number of senior Hamas leaders. They say they want the Gulf state to choose whether it wants to continue to host Hamas or be ""part of Western civilisation"". Israel says more than 130 people remain unaccounted for after they were abducted during the Hamas attacks. More than 100 captives were released during a six-day ceasefire at the end of November. Adding to Mr Albag's pain is the fear that Liri may have been sexually abused by her captors. He told the BBC that he thought released former hostages who spent time with his daughter Liri knew something about this but avoided telling him to spare him any grief. Some released hostages have said they were told directly by other female hostages that they had been sexually assaulted. A report by the Associated Press quoted doctors as saying that 10 of those released were assaulted or abused. Also, the BBC hasseen and heard evidence of sexual violenceagainst women on the day of the 7 October attacks. ""We know that some of the girls - it's very difficult to say this - they attacked them, sexually, and we are worried, especially that they didn't release them,"" Liri's father said. He added that there were women aged between 18 and 30 who had not been released. The former hostages would not respond to his ""difficult questions"" about sexual abuse and moved their eyes away, he said. ""I understand they don't want to talk about this, they don't want to hurt us. But we understand. We really understand,"" he says. Mr Albag says Liri is his youngest daughter, the ""happiest, who liked music, who liked to dance"" and who had ""friends all over the world"". He is a self-confessed tough guy but he is unable to sleep and often unable to talk because of what he thinks could be happening to her. ""All the family's broken, she has two sisters and a young brother, and from 7 October we are not living,"" he says. ""I wake up in the morning alive and go to sleep dead. Each day. This is what's happened to us, no day no night."" He says he knows from the released hostages that his daughter was alive and physically unhurt after 50 days of captivity, though they were living in a tunnel with no food, no water, no fresh air and no electricity. She was unable to have a shower for that whole period, he adds. ""It is our hope that we can receive her back, in good condition,"" he says. But his fears have led to other fears. More than three months since the hostages were taken, it could soon be too late for any unwanted pregnancies - resulting from rape - to be terminated. Mr Albag says: ""The clock is ticking, there is a limit of time to stop it."" Later on Monday the four Israelis attended a Conservative Friends of Israel meeting. Eli Albag handed UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak a dog tag with the words ""Bring them home"". Another of the four, Liran Berman, whose brothers Gali and Ziv are still held hostage, explained their message for the Qataris. ""We know that Qatar is the key player,"" he said. ""They are hosting the leadership of Hamas but they are also investing in Western civilisation, buying football teams and properties in London, in Europe, in the US. ""They need to choose a side. If they want to be part of Western civilisation, ok, but they can't host Hamas leaders."" A Qatari official responded by offering ""deepest sympathies"" to the families of the hostages and said they were continuing to engage with all sides, ""working around the clock to reunite the hostages with their families and bring an end to the war"". ""Since the first day of the crisis, Qatar has done everything it can to secure the release of hostages and prevent further bloodshed,"" the official added. ""This includes using its communication channel with Hamas, established over a decade ago in coordination with the United States. ""So far, 109 hostages have been released from Gaza through these efforts, while Qatari mediation succeeded last week in reaching an agreement to deliver medicine to hostages and other aid to civilians in Gaza.""",2024-01-23T17:07:32.000Z

"More than 25,000 now killed in Gaza since Israel offensive began, Hamas-run health ministry saysPublished21 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","More than 25,000 people have now been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive there, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It said there had been 178 deaths in the last 24 hours, making it one of the deadliest days in the war so far. As fighting continued, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rejected creating a Palestinian state. The White House has said the US and Israel ""clearly see things differently"" when it comesto a two-state solution. Israel began its offensive following the 7 October attack in which Hamas fighters killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took more than 240 hostage. In its first public account of the October assault, published on Sunday, Hamas described it as a ""necessary step"" against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners. Israel's air and ground operation is currently focusing on southern Gaza, where the military are convinced top Hamas commanders are holed up in, or beneath, the city of Khan Younis. That is where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had discovered another tunnel, some 830m (2,700ft) long and containing booby-traps and blast doors. The IDF footage showed what appeared to be a tunnel with mattresses and cells inside - it is where Israel believes around 20 hostages, including children, were held at various points. None were found when the tunnel was discovered, though. Israeli soldiers have also faced renewed attacks in the north of the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is said to have seized an opening around the town of Jabalia as Israel moved troops and tanks south. More than three months since the conflict erupted, Israel - whose army far outstrips Hamas's capabilities - is still facing significant resistance across Gaza. US intelligence agencies reportedly estimate that the Israeli military has killed 20-30% of Hamas fighters, which falls far short of Mr Netanyahu's stated aim of ""completely destroying"" the armed group. The classified report is also said to have found that Hamas still has enough munitions to continue striking Israel and Israeli forces for months, raising the spectre of a prolonged war in which Israel could get bogged down. The apparent slow progress, the fact no top Hamas commander has yet been captured or killed, and the collective trauma over the 130 or so Israeli hostages still missing, is prompting growing anti-government anger in Israel. Protests are continuing by relatives of those still held by Hamas, calling for Mr Netanyahu to prioritise their release over the potentially impossible aim of destroying Hamas. And a still relatively small anti-war movement is also demonstrating, horrified by the damage wrought on Gaza - one of the most intense and destructive military campaigns in recent history. Most Israelis have rallied around their flag - but not around their prime minister, who, according to a recent poll, only 15% of the public believe should stay in office once the war ends. How it does end is the subject of growing disagreement between Mr Netanyahu and Israel's western allies. Afterspeaking to US President Joe Bidenfor the first time in almost a month, the Israeli prime minister reiterated his rejection of a future Palestinian state. In a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said Israel must retain ""security control over the entire area west of [River] Jordan"", which also encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank territory. Mr Netanyahu has been fiercely opposed to a Palestinian state throughout his political career. But by repeatedly asserting it now, an increasingly unpopular prime minister appears to be doubling down on a view that he feels chimes with the majority opinion in a nation too horrified by the attacks to countenance an independent Palestinian state. His apparent fight for political survival is clashing with exasperated Israeli allies, who hope that the current bloodshed could force both sides into meaningful diplomacy over a sustainable two-state solution. UK Defence Secretary Grant Shappstold the BBC earlierthat Mr Netanyahu's stance was ""disappointing"". The White House has said the US and Israel ""clearly see things differently"". Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, went further, calling the refusal to accept a Palestinian state ""completely unacceptable"". He added it ""would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security"". Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200.

Shapps 'disappointed' by Netanyahu opposition to Palestinian statePublished21 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Creating two separate states is the only solution to ending the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the defence secretary has said. Grant Shapps said it was ""disappointing"" that Israel's prime minister has rejected the idea. Benjamin Netanyahu's position was not ""a surprise"", he told the BBC. But Mr Shapps said Palestinians ""deserved"" a sovereign state, adding ""I really don't see that there is another solution"". Following a call with US President Joe Biden on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu's office released a statement saying he had ""reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty"". Mr Shapps said the comments were ""very disappointing"". ""It's not in some senses a surprise - he's spent his entire political career against a two-state solution. But the point is, which other route is there to seriously resolve this?"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""Palestinians deserve a sovereign state, Israel deserves to have the full ability to defend itself, its own security. ""Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution."" He added there were a variety of views within the Israeli government ""so we very much distinguish between the views of individuals and our overall support for Israel as a country"". Labour has also described Mr Netanyahu's comments as ""completely unacceptable"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told Sky News: ""Statehood of a people is not in the gift of its neighbour, it is the right of a people and it is the right of the Palestinian people."" Mr Netanyahu's remarks appeared to deepen a public divide with the US. Speaking to reporters after the call between the two leaders, Mr Biden insisted a two-state solution was still possible with Mr Netanyahu in office. ""There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that... don't have their own militaries,"" he said. Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took 240 hostages in its surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October. In response, Israel launched airstrikes and a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, more than 25,000 people have been killed in the territory since the start of the conflict. Also appearing on the programme, Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf, whose parents-in-law were trapped in Gaza for more than three weeks in the early stages of the war, repeated his call for an immediate ceasefire. Asked if he thought people sometimes placed a different value on Palestinian lives, he said: ""Without a shadow of a doubt. If you talk to anybody who is Palestinian, you speak to many people in the Muslim community, they feel that the Palestinian blood is very cheap."" In his interview, Mr Shapps also said the UK needed to be prepared for ""a more dangerous world"". In a speech on Monday he warned of growing risks posed by countries including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, as well as terrorist groups. However, asked when the government would hit its target of spending 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the size of the economy, on defence, Mr Shapps said he could not give an exact date. He told the BBC the trajectory was ""already upwards"", with spending ""comfortably above 2%"", and that the target would be met ""when economic conditions allow"". It comes after former head of the British Army Gen Lord Dannatt warned the UK risked a repeat of the 1930s, when the ""woeful state"" of its armed forces failed to deter Hitler, unless it invested more in its military. Writing in the Times on Friday, he criticised the shrinking size of the Army and called for the government to commit to spending 3% of GDP on defence. Challenged over why the size of the Army was reducing if the threats to the UK were growing, Mr Shapps said: ""It's not the number of people alone that matters, it's the lethality, it's how capable our systems are of defence.""

Understanding a week of missile strikes across Middle EastPublished21 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The past week has seen new rounds of violence across the Middle East, deepening fears of conflict spreading in an already unstable region. Here is a brief guide to what has happened - and where it might lead. On Tuesday,Iran unexpectedly carried out a missile and drone attack on Pakistani territory. Iran said it was targeting an Iranian Sunni Muslim militant group, Jaish al-Adl, that has staged attacks inside Iran. Pakistan said two children were killed and swiftly hit back, launching missiles at Pakistani ""terrorist hideouts"" on Iran's side of the border. Iran said three women, two men and four children were killed. The flare-up has heightened tensions in a region already experiencing a multitude of crises. Although the area of the tit-for-tat strikes is far from the main theatres of fighting in the Middle East, the border is volatile and further incidents here could quickly escalate, for instance if Jaish al-Adl retaliates against Iran. This week saw multiple rounds of US Navy missile strikes against the Houthi Zaidi Shia movement in Yemen, following Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a waterway crucial to world trade. The Houthis - backed by Iran - stepped up their attacks in November following the outbreak of the war in Gaza. They vowed to target ""Israeli-linked"" boats so long as Israel's offensive continued, to show solidarity with the Palestinians. Consequently all merchant shipping in the international waters has been put under threat, something considered intolerable by Western powers. The US and UK, backed by allies, launched the first air strikes against the Houthis last week to try to deter them - but the group has remained defiant. On Monday, the Houthis hit a US vessel in the Gulf of Aden in what appeared to be their first successful attack on an American ship since their campaign began. A second was hit in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday and the Houthis have vowed to continue - raising the prospect of further US strikes and the question of whether Iran will feel forced to respond. An increasingly intensifying years-long shadow war between arch-foes Israel and Iran ratcheted up on Monday whenIran fired missiles at what it described as headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agencyin Irbil in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, killing four people. Iraq - an ally of Iran and hostile to Israel - denied Mossad was there and condemned the attack. Iran said its attack was a response to the alleged Israeli killings recently of a senior Iranian commander in Syria and two top Iran-backed militants in Lebanon - one a commander of the Shia militant movement Hezbollah and the other the deputy leader of the Palestinian group Hamas. The Israel-Lebanese border, where Israel and Hezbollah - heavily armed and funded by Iran - have frequently traded strikes since the Hamas attack on Israel and start of the Gaza war on 7 October, is one of the most dangerous fronts in the region. On Wednesday Israel's military chief of staff said ""the likelihood of [war in the north] happening in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past."" At the same time as it struck in Iraq, Iran fired missiles into a rebel-held province in north-west Syria, saying it had targeted bases of the Islamic State (IS) group in retaliation for IS suicide bombings in southern Iran on 3 January which killed 94 people. IS, a Sunni jihadist group, considers Shia Muslims heretical, and Iran is the dominant Shia power in the region. While Iran is a key ally of the Syrian government, directly striking militants in the rebel-held region is a rare step and a signal to its adversaries that Iran is prepared to act far afield. An air strike on the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Saturdaykilled 10 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five of them were senior members of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Syria and Iran blamed Israel, with Iran vowing revenge. It follows similar strikes around Damascus earlier in the week. Israel has not commented, but has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of aerial operations in Syria involving attacks on targets it says are linked to Iran. An interception of a fighter aircraft by Syrian air defences - which has so far not happened - or deadly retaliation could ignite a new crisis in a region beset by wars. Intense fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has continued, with the war there now in its 15th week. At least 891 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardment since last Sunday, raising the death toll there since 7 October to more than 25,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. On the Israeli side, nine soldiers were killed in the same period, bringing its combat death total to 189. Israel intensified its offensive on the southern city of Khan Younisthis week, while troops reached their furthest point south since the start of the war, the Israeli military said. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the conflict could go on until 2025, Israeli TV reported this week. Israel was also hit bya car-ramming and stabbing attackon Monday, for which police arrested two Palestinian suspects from the occupied West Bank. The attack, which was praised by Hamas, killed a woman and injured 17 other people. It was one of the first such attacks inside Israel since the start of the Gaza war, heightening anxieties among Israelis still reeling from the 7 October attacks. Violence has also escalated in the West Bank alongside the war. Israeli air strikes there on Wednesday killed nine Palestinians, medics said. Israel said at least five of the dead were planning an imminent attack. Missiles were fired at an air base used by US-led coalition forces in western Iraq on Saturday, injuring several US military personnel, US Central Command said. Iranian-backed militants are suspected of being behind the attack. Bases housing US and coalition forces in Iraq and north-east Syria have been attacked dozens of times by Iranian-backed militants in recent months, drawing US retaliation. The attacks are seen as part of Iran's indirect conflict with the US, where it can strike US assets at arms length. About 3,400 coalition personnel are in Iraq and Syria as part of efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group, which still operates in pockets in the region. Attacks by one country into another have also been happening in other places in the Middle East this week. Turkey carried out air strikes against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq and a US-backed Kurdish-led militia alliance in northern Syria on Monday, its defence ministry said. The latest strikes are part of a decades-long and bloody conflict between Turkey and armed Kurdish groups which Turkey, which has a large Kurdish minority, regards as terrorist organisations. One of the strikes is reported to have hit a prison holding more than 3,000 IS prisoners. There were alsorare air strikes by Jordan across its border with Syria. Ten people, including children, are reported to have been killed. It is thought to have targeted drug smugglers. Iran-backed militias in Syria have been accused by Jordan of trafficking the amphetamine Captagon into the kingdom and on to Gulf Arab states.",2024-01-21T10:32:59.000Z

What do Red Sea assaults mean for global trade?Published12 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Global supply chains are facing severe disruption as a result of the world's biggest shipping companies diverting journeys away from the Red Sea. Attacks by Houthis in Yemen on commercial vessels have resulted in many firms deciding to avoid one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The Houthi group has declared its support for Hamas and has said it is targeting ships travelling to Israel, though it is not clear if all the ships that have been attacked were actually heading to Israel. US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have now launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen in response to the attacks on shipping. The Houthis have been stepping up their attacks since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The group, which is backed by Iran, has been using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels transporting goods through the strait of Bab al-Mandab - a 20-mile wide channel that splits Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. Ships usually take this route from the south to reach Egypt's Suez Canal further north. But because of the attacks and the threat of future assaults, several of the world's largest shipping firms, including Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, have diverted vessels away to a much longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope and then up the west side of the continent. BP has also paused all shipments of oilthrough the Red Sea, blaming the ""deteriorating security situation"". The longer journeys add at least 10 days to shipping times and cost companies millions of dollars. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal to or from the Indian Ocean has to come via the strait of Bab al-Mandab and the Red Sea. The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe and is particularly important in the transportation of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG). About nine million barrels of oil per day were shipped through the Suez Canal in the first half of 2023, according to freight analytics firm Vortexa. Analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence said nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa were shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil. But it is not just about oil. Container ships carry all sorts of consumer goods seen in the shops including TVs, clothes, trainers and sports equipment. It is inevitable that supply chains will be affected due to ships being diverted away from the Red Sea, but consumer goods ""will face the largest impact"", according to Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, though he does note the current disruption has occurred ""during the off-peak shipping season"". Delays to products reaching shops can be expected, due to the Cape of Good Hope route adding about 3,500 nautical miles. Furniture giant Ikea and UK retailer Next have both warned that supplies of products could be delayed if disruption to shipping continues. Tesla has suspended manufacturing at its only European electric car factory due to supplies being disrupted. The extra distance will also cost companies more. According to supply chain advisers Drewry, the price of using a 40ft container has risen by 15% in the past week. These extra costs could be passed on by businesses to customers. However, container rates are still far below the levels seen in 2021, when freight charges soared in line with demand as Covid restrictions were eased. There are also fears the disruption could push up oil prices. A rise in oil prices, a key ingredient in car fuel, can lead to higher prices at the pumps and also drive higher inflation. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has been falling in the UK and is currently 3.9%. When it comes to shipments of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) being disrupted, even if wholesale energy prices rise, any increases would not feed through to domestic bills until April 2024 at the earliest. This is because the energy price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, has already been set for January. Is moving freight by sea the only option? Mr Rogers says transporting goods by rail instead would require ""crossing Russia"", which is under economic sanctions due to invading Ukraine, while ""trucking from the Gulf to Israel may only offset around 3% of shipping"". The US had launched an international naval operation in December to try to protect ships on the Red Sea route. This operation was joined by countries including the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain, but some shipping companies remained reluctant to start using the route again. Maersk resumed shipments through the Red Sea briefly following the introduction of the security operation, but paused sailings again afterone of its container ships came under attack. US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have now launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets across Yemen. ""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,"" US President Joe Biden said.",2024-01-12T11:00:43.000Z

Israel says war in Gaza expected to continue throughout 2024Published1 JanuaryShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israeli military has said it expects the conflict in Gaza to continue throughout 2024. In a new year's message, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said troop deployments were being adjusted to prepare for ""prolonged fighting"". Daniel Hagari said some troops - especially reservists - would be withdrawn to allow them to regroup. ""These adaptations are intended to ensure the planning and preparation for continuing the war in 2024,"" he said. ""The IDF must plan ahead out of an understanding that there will be additional missions and the fighting will continue the rest of the year."" He said that some reservists would leave Gaza ""as soon as this week"" to allow them to ""re-energise ahead of the coming operations"". Some 21,978 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Its latest update said 56,697 people in Gaza had been wounded over the same period. The figures included 156 people killed and 246 injured in the last 24 hours, the ministry added. The latest war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. Israel continued its bombardment of Gaza up until the end of what has been a dark year in the region. The IDF said it killed a senior Hamas commander involved in the 7 October attack, Adil Mismah, in an overnight strike on the town of Deir al-Balah. The Gaza health ministry reported at least 48 deaths in overnight bombing in Gaza City. Witnesses told the AFP news agency that another strike killed 20 people sheltering at Al-Aqsa University in the city's west. Another strike on Monday morning was said to have killed at least 10 people in the al-Maghazi refugee camp. The BBC has not been able to verify the latest battlefield reports. A resident of northern Gaza displaced to the south of the enclave highlighted the contrast between New Year celebrations around the world and the situation in Gaza. ""Tonight the sky in world countries will be lit by firecrackers, and joyful laughs will fill the air,"" Zainab Khalil, 57, told Reuters on Sunday. ""In Gaza our skies are now filled with Israeli missiles and tank shells that land on innocent, homeless civilians."" The UN says 85% of Gaza's 2.4 million people - almost two million - have now been displaced. Thousands of doses of vaccines against childhood diseases, including polio and measles, have been delivered to Gaza, to help tackle a growing health emergency, Reuters reports. The news agency quoted the Palestinian health ministry as saying that supplies estimated to cover vaccinations for up to 14 months had entered through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Speaking from Rafah, Ayadil Saparbekov from the World Health Organization told the BBC that vaccines were crucial because of the conditions in which Gazans were living. ""Thousands of people live together in overcrowded camps with very poor water conditions, poor hygiene and very poor sanitation - these are all breeding grounds for various diseases,"" he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that ""the war is at its height"". ""We are fighting on all of the fronts,"" he said. ""We have huge success but we also have painful cases. Achieving victory will require time. ""As the (army) chief of staff has said, the war will continue for many more months."" Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could ""make the desert bloom"". The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible. Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and southern Israel as it saw in the new year, with Israeli missile defence systems intercepting rockets fired from Gaza, AFP reported. One man who was in Tel Aviv celebrating the new year with friends said: ""I was terrified, like it was the first time I saw missiles. It's terrifying."" Hamas's military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said in a video posted on social media that it carried out both attacks. They said M90 rockets were used in ""response to the massacres of civilians"" perpetrated by Israel.",2024-01-01T21:47:21.000Z

"Israel-Gaza war: Displaced Gazans 'living in the open', UN saysPublished30 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Many displaced Gazans are living ""in the open, in the parks,"" Juliette Touma of the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has told the BBC. According to the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA), at least 100,000 people have fled to Rafah - which borders Egypt in Gaza's south - in recent days. UNRWA's Ms Touma said the UN was being authorised to bring in ""limited assistance"". But Gaza's humanitarian needs, she said, ""have massively grown"". She said UNRWA continued to face ""restrictions to access areas in the Gaza Strip where we should access"". Israel has said it is not limiting aid and the problem is with its distribution. It launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas's deadly 7 October attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and a further 240 taken hostage. More than 21,672 people have been killed in Gaza since that date, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says a further 56,165 Palestinians have been injured. Access to humanitarian aid in the 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide enclave has been tightly controlled since the start of the war. At the start of its military campaign, Israeli forces focused on Gaza's north. But more recently, they have been pounding Khan Younis in southern Gaza, which they see as a stronghold for Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a TV address on Saturday evening that Israel was ""fighting on all fronts"". He echoed remarks by the chief of general staff, saying the war would go on ""for many months"", until Israel achieved ""the release of all our hostages and the dismantlement of Hamas"". Speaking from Rafah, UNRWA's Gaza director Tom White told the BBC there were ""well over a million people"" seeking safety in the city. Mr White said that for ""hundreds of thousands of people"" seeking safety in Rafah, ""there are no spots left"" in shelters - which included UNRWA schools and other municipal facilities. He echoed comments made by Ms Touma, explaining that ""hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people are now sleeping in the open under flimsy pieces of plastic"" as a result of the overcrowding. In its latest report, UNRWA said up to 1.9m people have been displaced across the Gaza Strip since the start of the war. According to OCHA, the most recent wave of displacement into Rafah is due to intense fighting in Khan Younis and other parts of the territory. Residents in Khan Younis have reported intense gun battles between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters. Elsewhere in Gaza on Saturday, fighting was also reported in the Nuseirat refugee camp, Maghazi and in al-Bureij. In a statement on X,the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic-language spokesman warned that the main north-south road in Gaza, the Salah al-Din, was a ""battlefield"" and ""dangerous to reach"". Meanwhile, a third UN body - the World Health Organization (WHO) - has again warned of a spike in the spread of infectious diseases across Gaza's displaced community. WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there had been a rise in the number of diseases across Gaza between mid-October and mid-December. He said that across UN shelters there had been some 136,400 cases of diarrhoea, 55,400 cases of lice and scabies, and 126 cases of meningitis.",2023-12-30T21:24:54.000Z

Why 2023 was an uncomfortable year for the WestPublished30 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsWar in Ukraine,"The past 12 months have seen a number of setbacks for the US, Europe and other major democracies on the international politics stage. None has been disastrous, for now. But they point to a shifting balance of power away from the US-dominated, Western values that have held sway for years. On many fronts, the wind is blowing in the wrong direction for Western interests. Here's why, and what benefits could still emerge from changes under way: Despite some recent successes in the Black Sea, the war is not going well for Ukraine. That means, by extension, it is going badly for Nato and the EU, which have bankrolled Ukraine's war effort and its economy to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. This time last year, hopes were high in Nato that, supplied with modern military equipment and intensive training in Western countries, Ukraine's army could press home the advantage it had gained that autumn and push the Russians out of much of the territory they had seized. That hasn't happened. The problem has been one of timing. Nato countries took a long time making their mind up about whether they dared send modern Main Battle Tanks like Britain's Challenger 2 and Germany's Leopard 2 to Ukraine, in case it provoked President Vladimir Putin into some sort of rash retaliation. In the end, the West delivered the tanks, President Putin did nothing. But by the time they were ready to be deployed on the battlefield in June, Russian commanders had looked at the map and rightly guessed where Ukraine's main effort was going to be. Ukraine, they figured, would want to advance south through Zaporizhzhia oblast towards the Sea of Azov, driving a wedge through Russian lines, splitting them in two and cutting off Crimea. The Russian army may have performed abysmally in its attempts to seize Kyiv in 2022, but where it excels is in defence. All that time that Ukrainian brigades were getting trained up in Britain and elsewhere during the first half of 2023, and while the tanks were being shipped eastwards to the front, Russia was building the biggest, most extensive lines of defensive fortifications in modern history. Anti-tank mines, anti-personnel mines, bunkers, trenches, tank traps, drones and artillery have all combined to thwart Ukraine's plans. Its much-vaunted counter-offensive has failed. For Ukraine and the West, the metrics are nearly all going in the wrong direction. Ukraine is running critically short of ammunition and soldiers. Congressis holding up the White House's attemptsto push through a $60bn military support package. Hungaryis holding up the EU's €50bn aid package. One or both may eventually get through, but that may be too late. Ukrainian forces are already having to switch to the defensive. Meanwhile, Moscow has put its economy on a war footing, devoting one-third of its national budget to defence while throwing thousands of men and thousands of artillery shells at Ukraine's front lines. Obviously this situation is deeply disappointing for Ukraine, which had hoped by now to have turned the tide of war in its favour. But why does it matter to the West? It matters because President Putin, who personally ordered this invasion nearly two years ago, needs only to hold on to the territory he has seized (roughly 18% of Ukraine) to proclaim a victory. Nato has emptied its armouries and committed everything short of going to war in order to support its ally, Ukraine. All potentially ending in an embarrassing failure to reverse the Russian invasion. Meanwhile, the Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, all Nato members - are convinced that if Mr Putin can succeed in Ukraine, he will come for them within five years. The Russian president is a wanted man. In theory. In March 2023,he was indicted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague,along with his Commissioner for Children's Rights, for war crimes committed against Ukrainian children. The West hoped this would make him an international pariah and bottle him up in his own country, unable to travel for fear of arrest and deportation to The Hague. That hasn't happened. Since that indictment, President Putin has been to Kyrgyzstan, China, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, getting a red-carpet welcome each time. He has also taken part virtually in the Brics summit in South Africa. Round after round of EU sanctions were supposed to bring the Russian economy to its knees, forcing Mr Putin to reverse his invasion. Yet Russia has proved to be remarkably resilient to these sanctions, sourcing many products through other countries such as China and Kazakhstan. True, the West has largely weaned itself off Russian oil and gas, but Moscow has found other willing customers, albeit at a reduced price. The fact is that while Mr Putin's invasion and brutal occupation of Ukraine is abhorrent to Western nations, it largely isn't to the rest of the world. Many nations see this as Europe's problem, with some putting the blame on Nato, saying it provoked Russia by expanding too far east. To the dismay of Ukrainians, these nations seem oblivious to the widescale torture and abuses committed by Russia's invading troops. The West, Arab ministers told me recently at a summit in Riyadh, has double standards. ""Your governments are hypocrites,"" I was told. Why, they asked me, do you expect us to condemn Russia for killing civilians in Ukraine when you refuse a ceasefire in Gaza, where thousands of civilians are being killed? The Israel-Hamas war has clearly been catastrophic for all Gazans and for those Israelis affected by the murderous Hamas raid into southern Israel on 7 October. It has also been bad for the West. It has diverted global attention away from Nato's ally, Ukraine, as it struggles to hold off Russian advances this winter. It has diverted US munitions away from Kyiv in favour of Israel. But most of all, in the eyes of many Muslims and others around the world, it has made the US and UK appear complicit in the destruction of Gaza by protecting Israel at the UN. Russia, whose air force carpet-bombed the city of Aleppo in Syria, has seen its stock rise in the Middle East since 7 October. The war has already spread to the southern Red Sea, where Iran-backed Houthis are launching explosive drones and missiles at ships, driving up commodity prices as the world's major shipping companies are forced to divert all the way round the southern tip of Africa. Iran is under suspicion of secretly developing a nuclear weapon, which it denies. Yet despite Western efforts, it is far from isolated, having extended its military tentacles across Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Gaza through proxy militias that it funds, trains and arms. This year, has seen it forge an ever-closer alliance with Moscow, which it provides with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of Shahed drones to launch at Ukraine's towns and cities. Designated as a hostile threat by several Western nations, Iran has benefited from the Gaza war by positioning itself in the Middle East as a champion of the Palestinian cause. One by one, the countries of the Sahel region of West Africa have been succumbing to military coups that have seen the expulsion of European forces that were helping to combat a jihadist insurgency in the region. The former French colonies of Mali, Burkina Faso and Central African Republic had already turned against the Europeans when in July,yet another coup saw the ousting of a pro-Western president in Niger.The last French troops have now left the country, although 600 US troops remain there in two bases. Replacing the French and international forces are the Russian mercenaries of the Wagner group, which has managed to cling on to its lucrative business deals despite the mysterious death of its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, in a plane crash in August. Meanwhile, South Africa, once seen as a Western ally, has been holding joint naval exercises with Russian and Chinese warships. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is supposed to be under strict international sanctions because of its banned nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programme. Yet this year, it has forged close links with Russia, with its leader Kim Jong Un visiting a Russian spaceport, followed by North Korea sending a reported one million artillery shells to Russian forces fighting in Ukraine. North Korea has test-fired several intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are now believed capable of reaching most parts of the continental US. To some extent, 2023 has seen an easing of tension between Beijing and Washington, with a largely successful summit between Presidents Biden and Xi in San Francisco. But China has shown no sign of backing down on its claims over most of the South China Sea, issuing a new ""standard"" map that extends its claims almost right up to the coastlines of several Asia-Pacific nations. Nor has it given up its claims over Taiwan, which it has vowed to ""take back"", by force if necessary. Against this gloomy backdrop for the West, it is perhaps hard to see glimmers of hope. But on the plus side for the West, the Nato alliance has clearly rediscovered its defensive purpose, galvanised by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Western unanimity shown so far has surprised many, although some cracks are now beginning to appear. But it is in the Middle East where there is the greatest potential for improvement. That's partly because of the horrific scale of events which have unfolded on both sides of the Gaza-Israel border. Before 7 October, the search for a solution to the question of a future Palestinian state had largely been abandoned. A certain complacency had crept into Israel's dealings with the Palestinians that this was a problem that could somehow be managed through security measures, without having to make any serious moves towards offering them a state of their own. That formula has now been shown to be fatally flawed. One world leader after another has proclaimed that Israelis will not be able to live in the peace and security they deserve unless Palestinians can do the same. Finding a just and durable solution to a problem that stretches back into history is going to be incredibly difficult and will ultimately involve painful compromises and sacrifices on both sides if it is to succeed. But now at last, it has the world's attention.",2023-12-30T01:06:21.000Z

South Africa files ICJ case accusing Israel of 'genocidal acts'Published29 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"South Africa has filed a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging that Israel is engaging in ""genocidal acts"" in Gaza. The UN court confirmed the application concerning alleged violations of Israel's obligations under the Genocide Convention. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". ""Israel rejects with disgust the blood libel spread by South Africa"", the foreign ministry said. The ICJ, which is based in the Hague in the Netherlands, is the UN's principal judicial organ. It settles disputes between states and gives advisory opinions on international legal issues. Following its application to the ICJ, South Africa's presidency said in a statement that the country was obliged ""to prevent genocide from occurring"". ""South Africa is gravely concerned with the plight of civilians caught in the present Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip due to the indiscriminate use of force and forcible removal of inhabitants,"" it said. ""Furthermore, there are ongoing reports of international crimes, such as crimes against humanity and war crimes, being committed as well as reports that acts meeting the threshold of genocide or related crimes... have been and may still be committed in the context of the ongoing massacres in Gaza."" The 84-page documentstates that the ""acts and omissions by Israel"" are ""genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". The application asks the ICJ for a hearing to take place next week and requests that a number ""provisional measures"" be indicated by the court, including that Israel cease all military activities in Gaza. Lior Haiat, a spokesman for Israel's foreign affairs ministry, said South Africa's claim ""constitutes despicable and contemptuous exploitation of the Court."" He said South Africa was ""cooperating with a terrorist organisation that is calling for the destruction of the State of Israel"" and said Hamas was ""responsible for the suffering of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by using them as human shields and stealing humanitarian aid from them"". ""Israel is committed to international law and acts in accordance with it, and directs its military efforts only against the Hamas terrorist organization and the other terrorist organizations cooperating with Hamas,"" Mr Haiat said. ""Israel has made it clear that the residents of the Gaza Strip are not the enemy, and is making every effort to limit harm to the non-involved and to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip."" South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. In early November, it recalled all of its diplomats from Israel. Israel, in turn, recalled its ambassador from Pretoria. In addition, the South African national assembly voted to suspend all diplomatic relations with Israel, but the government has not yet formally responded to the vote. South Africa previously filed a referral to a different court, the International Criminal Court (ICC), relating to alleged war crimes by Israel in Gaza. The ICC ​investigates and tries individuals charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Israel does not recognise the ICC. The current war between Israel and Hamas was triggered by the 7 October Hamas attack on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people - most of them civilians - and saw about 240 others taken hostage. More than 21,500 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",2023-12-29T21:19:08.000Z

Thousands of Palestinians flee central Gaza as Israeli troops advancePublished29 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An estimated 150,000 Palestinians are being forced to flee areas of central Gaza, the UN has said, as Israeli forces advance on refugee camps there. Witnesses and Hamas's armed wing reported that tanks had reached the eastern outskirts of Bureij camp. Israel's military recently expanded its ground offensive to target Bureij and nearby Nuseirat and Maghazi camps. Israeli bombardment also killed dozens of people across Gaza on Thursday, the Hamas-run health ministry said. Egypt has confirmed that it has put forward a three-stage proposal to stop the fighting which ends with a ceasefire. A Hamas delegation is said to have arrived in Cairo to give its response to the plan. The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. More than 21,300 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the health ministry. The Israeli military has called for the evacuation of a strip of land stretching across central Gaza that includes Bureij and Nuseirat camps, and told the almost 90,000 residents and 61,000 displaced people in the affected areas to move southwards to the town of Deir al-Balah. However, the UN warned on Thursday that they had nowhere to go because Deir al-Balah was already overcrowded, with several hundred thousand displaced people sheltering there. The UN says that Rafah - which had already become the most densely populated town in Gaza - has seen about 100,000 new arrivals in recent days as Israeli ground forces have pushed into new neighbourhoods. Omar, 60, said he had been forced to flee Bureij along with at least 35 members of his family. ""That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,"" he told Reuters news agency by phone. ""We are now in a tent in Deir al-Balah because of this brutal Israeli war."" Tom White, Gaza director for UN relief agency UNRWA, said more and more people were being pushed into the southern Gaza town of Rafah, ""so more people into a very small strip of land that cannot support them"". On Thursday evening, Gaza's health ministry reported that 20 people had been killed in an Israeli air strike on a building in Rafah that was reportedly housing displaced civilians. On Thursday morning, the ministry's spokesman announced that 50 people had been killed in Israeli strikes in Maghazi, the northern town of Beit Lahia and in the southern city of Khan Younis. The deadliest incident was in Beit Lahia, where Palestinian media reported that 30 were killed when a block of four residential buildings was destroyed. A local TV journalist, Bassel Kheir al-Din, told the Associated Press news agency that 12 members of his family wereburied beneath the rubble of one of the buildings and presumed dead, and that nine of their neighbours were missing. The Palestinian Red Crescent said10 people had been killed when Israeli shellfire hit an apartment near al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis, a day after a similar incident in front of the facility reportedly left 31 dead. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters on Wednesday thatthe city was ""a main Hamas terror centre"". He also said troops were fighting in the Bureij area for a third day, adding that they were ""eliminating many terrorists and destroying terrorist infrastructure"". Residents told Reuters that the heavy fighting continued on Thursday, with Israeli tanks advancing on the densely populated Bureij camp from the north and east. Hamas posted a video showing what it said was its fighters targeting Israeli soldiers and vehicles. In a separate development, the IDF said it regretted the ""harm caused to uninvolved civilians"" resulting from an air strike in Maghazi on Sunday that killed at least 70 people, according to Gaza's health ministry. Its statement said fighter jets had ""struck two targets adjacent to which Hamas operatives were located"". In Israel, thousands of teenagers took part in a march to demand a new deal to return the more than 100 hostages still being held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza. Many of the demonstrators were from the communities worst affected by the 7 October attacks. ""I'm from Kibbutz Kfar Aza,"" Shiri Khiyali told the BBC. ""I was there on 7 October. My people were kidnapped. We want them back. We want them back now."" Separately, there was a new call from UN human rights chief Volker Türk urging Israel to stop what he called ""unlawful"" killings in the occupied West Bank. A report said the UN had verified the killing of 300 Palestinians by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank since 7 October. A spokeswoman for Israel's prime minister dismissed the report as quite ridiculous and said it belittled the major security threats to Israelis.",2023-12-29T04:36:12.000Z

Israel Gaza war: Israel warns Hezbollah and Lebanon over border fightingPublished28 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel will act to remove Hezbollah from the border with Lebanon if the militia group's attacks continue, an Israeli minister has warned. Benny Gantz said the Israeli military would intervene if militants do not stop firing on northern Israel. Time for a diplomatic solution was running out, he added. Meanwhile, the head of the Israel Defense Forces said troops were in ""very high readiness"" for more fighting in the north. ""Our first task is to restore security and the sense of security to the residents in the north, and this will take time,"" Chief of the General Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said, after conducting a ""situational assessment"". Cross-border exchanges of fire have been escalating since Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel. On Wednesday, Hezbollah launched its highest number of cross-border attacks in a day since 8 October, security sources told Reuters. It has led to concerns the conflict in Gaza could become wider across the region. ""The situation on Israel's northern border demands change,"" Mr Gantz told a news conference on Wednesday night. ""The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the world and the Lebanese government don't act in order to prevent the firing on Israel's northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it."" But the Lebanese ambassador in the UK, Rami Mortada, said his country was on the receiving end of attacks and ""the party that should hold back is Israel"". ""We are not interested in escalation - all sides need to de-escalate,"" he told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme. Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on a visit to troops near the border that Israel would ""single-handedly turn Beirut and South Lebanon, not far from here, into Gaza and Khan Yunis"" if Hezbollah started an all-out war. Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim organisation - is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League. Funded by Iran, it is one of the most heavily-armed,non-state military forces in the world. In 2006, a full-blown war between Hezbollah and Israel was triggered when Hezbollah carried out a deadly cross-border raid, with Israeli troops invading southern Lebanon. At the border, there has been an increase in rocket fire and the use of weaponised drones by Hezbollah this week, with Israeli war planes quick to respond. On Thursday, Israeli forces said they intercepted a drone crossing into their territory from Lebanon. And on Wednesday, state media in Lebanon reported that a Hezbollah fighter and two of his relatives had been killed in an Israeli air strike. The attack reportedly hit a house in Bint Jbeil, a town about 2km (1.2 miles) from the border with Israel. A Hezbollah statement said one of the victims, Ibrahim Bazzi, was an Australian citizen visiting his family. More than 100 people have been killed in Lebanon since October - most of them Hezbollah fighters but civilians, including three journalists, are also among the dead. On the Israeli side, at least four civilians and nine soldiers are known to have died on the Lebanon border since hostilities began. Thousands of civilians living in dozens of communities in the area have been evacuated by the army. Meanwhile, Unifil - the UN peacekeeping force that has operated in southern Lebanon since 1978 - called on Lebanese authorities to investigate after one of its troops was wounded in the country's south. Unifil said a patrol was attacked ""by a group of young men"" in Taybeh, with a vehicle also damaged. Hezbollah's leadership praised the unprecedented cross-border attack launched by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others were taken hostage. More than 21,100 people have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Thousands of Palestinian families in Gaza are trying to find shelter as Israel broadens its ground offensive across the centre and south of the territory.",2023-12-28T18:33:33.000Z

Israel expanding ground offensive into central Gaza refugee campsPublished27 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel is expanding its ground offensive into Palestinian refugee camps in central Gaza, as it warns the war with Hamas will last for months. The UN has expressed grave concern after Israeli strikes reportedly killed dozens of people in Bureij, Nuseirat and Maghazi camps in recent days. Heavy fighting is also continuing to the south, in the city of Khan Younis. Meanwhile, the Palestinian president has described what is happening in Gaza as ""beyond a war of annihilation"". The Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 195 people have been killed across the territory over the past 24 hours. More than 21,100 have been killed - mostly children and women - during 11 weeks of fighting, according to the ministry. The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. Palestinian media cited local officials and witnesses as saying dozens of civilians were killed as Israel kept up its strikes across Gaza overnight. Heavy bombardment was reported in the Middle Area, particularly in Bureij, Maghazi and Nuseirat camps. In Nuseirat, Israeli warplanes targeted the homes of the Nasser and Hazouqi families, killing a number of people and wounding dozens more,according to the official Wafa news agency. Hamas-affiliated Safa news agency also reported that five had been killed in a strike on a girls school in Maghazi. Residents meanwhile told Reuters news agency that there was heavy fighting east and north of Bureij district and in the nearby village of Juhr al-Deek. There was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters on Tuesday evening that its forces had ""expanded the combat to the area known as the Central Camps"". The IDF had earlier released videos and photos that it said showed several tanks operating on the outskirts of one of the camps, as well as a tunnel shaft and a Hamas training facility discovered in Bureij. It also reiterated an order for residents to leave more than a dozen central areas running from the Gaza-Israel perimeter to the coast, including Bureij and Nuseirat camps. According to the UN, the affected areas were home to nearly 90,000 people before the war. They also now include six shelters hosting about 61,000 displaced people, mostly from the north. The residents have been told to move immediately to shelters in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which is already struggling to cope with several hundred thousand displaced people. The UN human rights officesaid on Tuesday that it was gravely concernedabout the continued bombardment of the Middle Area and its densely populated camps, citing a report from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) that Deir al-Balah's al-Aqsa hospital had admitted 131 dead following Israeli strikes on Maghazi and Bureij on Sunday. It also warned of a ""deepening and already catastrophic humanitarian situation"", saying that all roads connecting the three camps had been destroyed and that any shelters and hospitals still operating were critically overcrowded and under-resourced. A Palestinian woman living in the UK, Alaa, told the BBC that her family had been in Maghazi during Sunday's strikes and were ""having to live with... constant loss, constant fear"". ""Pulling people from under the rubble and losing friends, losing family members, being displaced, losing homes,"" she said. ""My four-year-old nephew... had to evacuate with my family the other day and he was crying, asking for his dad who was killed a month ago."" The bombardment of the north and south of Gaza also continued on Wednesday. In the afternoon, the Hamas-run health ministry said 20 people had been killed in an Israeli air strike on a house where displaced people were staying near the al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis. The Palestinian Red Crescent, which runs the hospital, said dozens were killed or wounded and posted a graphic video that showed paramedics and bystanders retrieving several bodies on a street. The IDF has not yet commented on the incident, but a spokesperson did appear to confirm reports from Tuesday that Israel had handed over the bodies of 80 Palestinians after checking there were no hostages among them. ""During the war, bodies have been transported to Israel for an identification procedure as part of our effort to locate the hostages and the missing persons,"" the spokesperson said. It is believed that more than 100 hostages remain alive in Gaza, after 105 were released from captivity in late November, most of them Israeli women and children. A number of bodies have also been recovered and Israeli officials have confirmed the deaths of more than 20 people who had been held by Hamas. Israel's been under pressure from its closest ally, the US, to lower the intensity of its military operations in Gaza and reduce the number of civilian deaths, but there is no sign of that happening yet. The IDF's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, warned that the fighting with Hamas was taking place in ""a complex area""and would therefore ""continue for many more months"". ""There are no magic solutions or shortcuts in the fundamental dismantling of a terrorist organisation, except persistent and determined fighting, and we are very, very determined,"" he added. ""We will also get to the Hamas leadership, whether it takes a week or months."" He was speaking amid new signs of rising regional tensions with incidents linked to Iran-backed groups in the Red Sea, on the Lebanese border and in Iraq. In his first interview since the start of the war, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - a political rival of Hamas who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - said it was unprecedented in Palestinian history. ""What's happening in the Palestinian territories is far beyond a disaster and far more than a genocide. The Palestinians have never seen anything like this,"" he told Egypt's ON TV. Mr Abbas also warned that the West Bank could implode at any time. On Wednesday, six Palestinians, including a 17-year-old boy, were killed in a drone strike during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp near the western West Bank town of Tulkarm, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The IDF said six ""armed terrorists"" were killed in an air strike after they threw explosive devices at troops carrying out an operation to arrest wanted people.",2023-12-27T17:16:10.000Z

Hapag-Lloyd says Red Sea route still 'too dangerous'Published27 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"One of the world's biggest shipping firms, Hapag-Lloyd, will not resume its use of the Suez Canal despite an international military operation to keep the area safe. Yemen's Houthi rebels backing Hamas in the Israel-Gaza war said they are targeting vessels which they believe are heading for Israel. Several firms have stopped using the route following attacks. On Tuesday, Danish shipping firm Maersk said it will resume Red Sea operations. But Germany's Hapag-Lloyd said it considers passage through one of the world's most popular trade routes still ""too dangerous"", and that it would continue to reroute its ships via the Cape of Good Hope. The firm is the world's fifth largest shipping firm by capacity. A spokesperson added that it will review its decision on Friday. Some ships using the Red Sea, with Yemen to its south, have come under attack from drones and rockets by Houthi rebels. In response, more than a dozen countries have joined a US coalition called Prosperity Guardian to try and protect commercial shipping in the area. Hapag-Lloyd's announcement comes a day after the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) said that one of its container ships was attacked while transiting the southern Red Sea en route to Pakistan from Saudi Arabia. In a statement, the Switzerland based company said it had informed the coalition naval task force and ""as instructed, engaged in evasive manoeuvres"". All crew were safe with no reported injuries, MSC added. With the Suez Canal to the north of the Red Sea, it makes the route one of the world's most important routes for consumer goods, oil and liquefied natural gas shipments. The alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope, adds about 3,500 nautical miles to the journey - leading to fears of disruption to the supply of goods transported through the Suez Canal, and an increase in prices to cover the higher transport costs. Furniture giant Ikea hassaid supplies of its products could be delayedfollowing rebel attacks on ships using the route, while giant BP said that it would temporarily pause all shipments of crude through the Red Sea. Maersk meanwhile said in a statement issued on Sunday that although security measures had been put in place, ""the overall risk in the area is not eliminated at this stage"". ""Maersk will not hesitate to re-evaluate the situation and once again initiate diversion plans if we deem it necessary for the safety of our seafarers,"" it said. Hapag-Lloyd has told the BBC that 25 ships are facing diversion. The length of delays the ships face in reaching their destination vary in length from 18 days for those heading to or from the eastern Mediterranean, to 10-14 days for those travelling to or from Northern Europe, and 7 days for US east coast journeys. Although some companies like France's CMA CGM and Maersk are slowly preparing to re-use the route, the difficulties in the area will affect various economies as it is a key route allowing trade between Europe and Africa. Mohamed Ata, an Egyptian analyst for the Universal Stock company, said Egypt would be hugely impacted by the tension. ""Amid a global recession, Egypt is grappling with shortages of foreign exchange reserves caused by the impact on the Suez Canal, which serves as one of Egypt's main sources of foreign currency. As the most crucial waterway globally, any disruptions in the canal will significantly impact Egypt's foreign currency earnings"", he said.

"Israel-Gaza war will continue for months, IDF chief warnsPublished26 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Israel's war with Hamas militants in Gaza will continue for ""many more months"", Israel's army chief has said. ""There are no magic solutions,"" Herzi Halevi told reporters. On Monday PM Benjamin Netanyahu warned that the campaign was ""not close to being over"". Israel says it hit more than 100 sites on Tuesday. It is reportedly extending ground operations to central Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 20,915 Palestinians have been killed in more than 11 weeks of fighting. The war began on 7 October after Hamas led a wave of deadly attacks on communities inside Israel. About 1.9 million have been internally displaced by Israeli bombardments since then, the UN says. Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for the UN Palestinian refugee agency (Unwra) told the BBC: ""We're seeing very worrying reports of hunger and starvation in some places, and meanwhile the war continues, the displacement continues and UN shelters are overcrowded and overwhelmed."" Last week US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called on Israel to lower the intensity of its strikes to limit ""harm done to civilians"". On Tuesday Herzi Halevi, chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), told a news conference that the war would ""continue for many more months"" to ensure that ""our achievements are preserved for a long time"". ""There are no shortcuts when it comes to thoroughly dismantling a terrorist organisation except being stubborn and determined in the fighting,"" he added. The IDF says Tuesday's air strikes hit 100 targets from Jabaliya in northern Gaza to Khan Yunis and Rafah in the south. There are also reports that it launched a ground offensive in refugee camps in central Gaza after ordering residents to evacuate. Internet and telephone services were again cut across the Gaza Strip. Some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed in the 7 October attacks. About 240 people were taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel says 132 are still being held. On Monday Mr Netanyahu told parliament: ""We will not be able to release all the abductees without military pressure... we will not stop fighting."" Israeli and Arab media say that Egypt has proposed a plan for a ceasefire. According to reports, the plan would see the phased release of all Israeli hostages and an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, ending with a suspension of Israel's offensive. A previous temporary truce deal negotiated by Qatar saw dozens of hostages released from Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. So far, both Israel and Hamas have resisted calls for a lasting ceasefire. Meanwhile Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer is Washington for talks with Mr Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. The talks will focus on ""matters related to the conflict in Gaza and the return of hostages held by Hamas"", National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.",2023-12-26T20:32:30.000Z

India deploys three warships to Arabian Sea after attack on tankerPublished26 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"India has said it is sending three warships to the Arabian Sea after a drone hit an ""Israel-affiliated"" merchant vessel off its western coast last week. MV Chem Pluto was attacked about 200 nautical miles (370km) off the coast of the western state of Gujarat. The attack triggered a fire but it was quickly extinguished by the crew. There were no casualties. The vessel's crew included 21 Indians and a Vietnamese citizen. The MV Chem Pluto is Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned, and Netherlands-operated chemical tanker. British Maritime Security firm Ambrey said the ship was linked to Israel but didn't specify the connection. Indian media reports said the vessel was transporting oil from Saudi Arabia and was heading to the Mangalore Port in southern India when the attack took place. After the attack, an Indian Coast Guard ship accompanied the MV Chem Pluto to Mumbai on Monday. ""Considering the recent spate of attacks in the Arabian Sea, Indian Navy has deployed Guided Missile Destroyers, INS Mormugao, INS Kochi and INS Kolkata in various areas to maintain a deterrent presence,"" the navy statement said. The navy added that it was also regularly flying a long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft to monitor the situation. India heavily relies on fuel shipments from the Middle East, particularly from Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Any disruption in this route can be problematic for India. ""India plays the role of a net security provider in the entire Indian Ocean region,"" Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday. He said the Indian Navy had increased its surveillance of the seas. ""We shall find whoever is responsible for this attack and strict action will be taken against them."" No group has admitted responsibility for the drone attack. The United States blamed Tehran for the attack but a spokesperson for Iran's foreign ministry called the accusation ""baseless"". A spate of attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels, who are opposed to Israel's military campaign in Gaza, have triggered concerns for the global shipping industry. The US Central Command says at least 15 commercial ships have come under attack by Houthi militants so far in the past two months. Several shipping companies have alreadychanged the courseof their vessels to avoid the Red Sea. That is triggering concerns for exporters in South Asia. ""We are worried. Our shipping agents say the transport cost could increase by 10 to 15% and the travel time will increase by five to seven days,"" said Syed Nazrul Islam, vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association told the BBC. Bangladesh exports billions of dollars' worth of ready-made clothes to Europe and the United States. Though the cost of transport is usually paid by the clothing brands in the West, Mr Islam said Bangladeshi exporters were worried that the buyers would ask for a discount next time when they order.

Gemma Connell of the UN humanitarian agency Ocha told the BBC what she had seen at the Al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza on Monday was ""absolute carnage"". Many severely injured people could not be treated because the hospital was ""absolutely overloaded"", she said. Israel's prime minister earlier vowed to intensify the fight against Hamas. BenjaminNetanyahu said he had visited Gaza on Monday morningand that Israel's military campaign there was ""not close to being over"". His comments come days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel should lower the intensity of its strikes. In another development, the Pentagon says theUS armed forces have carried out air strikes in Iraqagainst ""Iranian-sponsored militias"" in response to an attack on the Irbil air base that injured three US military personnel, one of them critically. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes had targeted three facilities used by the Iranian-backed Kataeb Hezbollah group and its affiliates. He said there had been a series of attacks by the militias on US bases in both Iraq and Syria, and stressed that the US would not hesitate to protect its people and facilities. There has been an escalation of activity by Kataeb Hezbollah and other armed militias in the region following Israel's military operation in Gaza. Tom White, director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that there were currently an estimated 150,000 people in central Gaza who had received evacuation orders from the Israeli military. Also speaking to the Newshour, Ms Connell said: ""What I saw at the Al-Aqsa Hospital in [the city of] Deir al-Balah was absolute carnage."" There were, she said, many casualties there with ""extremely severe wounds but [who] cannot be treated because there are so many people in front of them in the line for surgery, and the hospital is absolutely overloaded."" ""And some of those that I saw were people who were hit in the strike yesterday [Sunday],"" she said in a reference to a reported attack on the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 70 people were killed in the Israeli strike. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had received ""reports of an incident in the Maghazi camp"". It added that ""despite the challenges posed by Hamas terrorists operating within civilian areas in Gaza, the IDF is committed to international law including taking feasible steps to minimize harm to civilians"". Ms Connell also said that while she was visiting Al-Aqsa ""there were new air strikes hitting areas around the hospital in the middle area and new casualties being brought in"". ""Tragically I saw a nine-year-old boy with a devastating head injury who passed away,"" she added. ""When I say that there were strikes again today and casualties arriving, some of those strikes were in areas that people have been told to evacuate to, which, again goes back to the refrain that, I think, I am so sick of saying: that there is no safe place in Gaza,"" she said. ""And even when people are told to evacuate the places that they are fleeing to are not safe."" The war began on 7 October after Hamas led a deadly attack on communities inside Israel, killing 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and seizing about 240 hostages. Israel says 132 are still being held.

Archbishop of Canterbury highlights suffering in Israel-Gaza war in Christmas Day sermonPublished25 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Archbishop of Canterbury has spoken about children caught up in the Israel-Gaza war in his Christmas Day sermon. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said ""this year, the skies of Bethlehem are full of fear rather than angels and glory"" during a service at Canterbury Cathedral. He also referred to conflict elsewhere including in Ukraine, saying ""around the world, we are beset with violence"". And he talked about the ""age-old sin"" of antisemitism in the UK. He compared the turbulent background of Jesus' upbringing with the struggles of children in the region today. He said: ""Today a crying child is in a manger somewhere in the world, nobody willing or able to help his parents, or her parents, who so desperately need shelter. ""Or perhaps lying in an incubator, in a hospital low on electricity, like the Anglican Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza, surrounded by suffering and death. ""Or maybe the newborn lies in a house that still bears the marks of the horrors of 7 October, with family members killed, and a mother who counted her life as lost."" On 7 October, the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which governs Gaza, led a massive attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking about 240 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a war against it in response, which has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Archbishop Welby also referred to antisemitism in the UK, saying: ""Or maybe they are not a newborn, but someone thinking of next term, having again to hide their Jewishness on their way to school in this country. ""Or a playgroup in our own cities, fearful of the age-old sin, the atrocious sin, of antisemitism"". The archbishop said ""serving, not in being served"" was the answer to resolving problems such as climate change, terrorism, economic inequality, antisemitism, Islamophobia and racism. God ""confronts our cruelty with his compassion"" and ""responds to our selfishness with service"", Archbishop Welby said. He referred to a visit to a US church which among other things took in guns from the streets, and said he himself was wearing a cross made out of a melted-down automatic rifle - ""transformed into a sign of hope and life"". He also paid tribute to King Charles III, whose coronation he led in May 2023. ""Two thousand years later, in our culture, it seems natural and right for a king in royal robes to answer a child, 'I come not to be served, but to serve' - and we know that that is the right way to be a king."" Peace was also a strong theme for the leader of Catholicism in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, who spoke about the ""terrible war ravaging parts of the Holy Land"" at Midnight Mass in Westminster Cathedral.

Pope Francis has also appealed for peace against the ""futile logic of war"" during Christmas Eve mass. The Pope told worshippers at Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican: ""Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world.""",2023-12-25T14:13:47.000Z

Israel Gaza war: Hamas says 70 killed in Israeli air strike on campPublished25 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says an Israeli air strike killed at least 70 people in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in the centre of the strip. A spokesman said the death toll was likely to rise given the large number of families living in the area. The Israeli military told the BBC it was looking into reports of the strike. It comes as Israeli and Arab media say Egypt, which borders the Gaza Strip, has put forward a new proposal for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Dozens of injured people were rushed from Maghazi to nearby Al-Aqsa Hospital with footage showing some children's faces covered in blood and body bags piled outside. The health ministry says three houses were hit in the attack late on Sunday. According to ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra, a densely populated residential block was destroyed. A father said he had lost his daughter and grandchildren, adding that his family had fled from the north for safety in central Gaza. ""They lived on the third floor of one of the buildings,"" he said. ""The wall collapsed on them. My grandchildren, my daughter, her husband - all gone. ""We are all targeted. Civilians are targeted. There is no safe place. They told us to leave Gaza City - now we came to central Gaza to die."" The Palestine Red Crescent Society says ""intense"" Israeli air strikes have led to the closure of main roads between Maghazi and two other refugee camps, Al-Bureij and Al-Nuseirat, ""hindering the work of ambulances and rescue teams"". In a statement to the BBC, the Israeli military said it had received ""reports of an incident in the Maghazi camp"". ""Despite the challenges posed by Hamas terrorists operating within civilian areas in Gaza, the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] is committed to international law including taking feasible steps to minimize harm to civilians,"" it added. According to the health ministry, more than 20,000 people have been killed - mostly children and women - and 54,000 injured in Gaza since 7 October, when Hamas and other Palestinian groups attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. Earlier on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu said the war had come at a ""very heavy price"" for his country. The Israeli military said more than a dozen soldiers had been killed in Gaza since Friday, bringing the total for the ground offensive launched after 7 October to 156. Saturday was one of its deadliest days but Mr Netanyahu said there was ""no choice"" but to keep fighting. The new ceasefire proposal by Egypt would be implemented in three parts: Indirect negotiations would be held in Egypt with Qatari and US participation. An Israeli source told Maariv newspaper that the Egyptian initiative could lead to negotiations. Hamas says it is studying the proposal. Meanwhile, the Danish shipping giant, Maersk, says it is preparing to resume shipping operations through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The announcement came after an international military operation, led by the US, was deployed to prevent the targeting of commercial ships by drones from areas of Yemen controlled by Houthi rebels. The Houthis have declared their support for Hamas and have said they would target any ship travelling to Israel. Maersk and other shipping companies stopped sending ships through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal earlier this month as a result of drone attacks. US Central Command said two days ago that a US navy destroyer had shot down four drones in the Red Sea launched from Yemeni territory. In another development, Pope Francis appealed for peace in the Middle East as he presided over a Christmas Eve Mass at Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Referring to the war between Israel and Hamas, the Pope said Jesus's message of peace was being drowned out by the ""futile logic of war"" in the very land where he had been born.

Israel-Gaza war: Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel paying 'heavy price'Published24 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Gaza war has come at a ""very heavy price"" for his side. The military says more than a dozen soldiers have been killed in the territory since Friday, bringing the total of the ground assault to 154. Saturday was one of its deadliest days - but the Israeli PM there was ""no choice"" but to keep fighting. Meanwhile, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 70 people were killed in a strike on a refugee camp on Sunday. More than 20,000 people have been killed - mostly women and children, and 54,000 injured in Gaza since 7 October, the ministry says. Remarking on the latest Israeli troop deaths, Mr Netanyahu said: ""This is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza."" But he said his forces would continue with ""full force until the end"", reiterating his goals of eliminating Hamas and ensuring the safe return of hostages held in Gaza. ""Let it be clear: this will be a long war,"" the Israeli prime minister added. The military's 154th death was announced later that day: tank commander Maj Aryeh Rein. In a separate statement, the military said it had killed more than 8,000 Palestinian fighters during its campaign to date - in remarks quoted by the Reuters news agency. The Israeli operation began after Hamas fighters crossed from Gaza into southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. Israel insists that it takes steps to avoid civilian casualties, and blames Hamas for embedding itself in densely-populated areas. US President Joe Biden - a key ally of Mr Netanyahu - emphasised the ""critical need"" to protect civilian lives during a call with the Israeli prime minister on Saturday, the White House said. Mr Biden told reporters that he had not asked for a ceasefire in the call. Both men believe such a move would benefit Hamas. On Friday, the UN Security Council approved a resolution demanding large-scale aid deliveries to Gaza - but this, too, stopped short of calling for a ceasefire between the two warring sides. Talks held in Egypt earlier this week designed to secure a fresh truce between Israel and Hamas have so far failed to deliver results. A Palestinian official familiar with the ceasefire negotiations told the BBC that Egypt presented a new three-stage plan that would begin with a two-week humanitarian truce - which could be extended - during which Hamas would release 40 hostages and Israel would release 120 Palestinian prisoners. This stage would be followed by the formation of an independent body to deal with humanitarian relief and reconstruction, as well as a comprehensive ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners. The Israeli military has kept up its bombing campaign in Gaza - ordering civilians to flee. The UN said the latest evacuation order affected 150,000 people in the middle of the territory. On Saturday, Israel said700 Palestinian militants had been arrested during its ground offensive to date. It also said one of its fighter jets had killed Hassah Atrash, a man it accused of smuggling weapons into Gaza to arm Hamas. There has been no confirmation from Hamas. The Israeli military has said it has almost full operational control of the north of the Gaza Strip, and is stepping up operations elsewhere. A spokesman has said troops are entering new Hamas strongholds in southern areas. Briefing his cabinet on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu denied suggestions the US president had persuaded him against further expanding his military operation. The Wall Street Journal had reported that Mr Netanyahu had been talked out of attacking Hamas's ally in Lebanon, the Hezbollah group. A government spokesperson told the BBC ""the situation in the north... is intolerable"" and that Israel was ""trying to deter Hezbollah from dragging us into a war"". ""We will continue making the necessary preparations to repel this threat from the northern border,"" he added.",2023-12-24T21:23:08.000Z

"'Bethlehem is empty of joy - no Santa, no celebration'Published24 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The atmosphere in Bethlehem is heavy with absence. Christmas celebrations have been cancelled this year and the thousands of tourists and pilgrims who would normally fill Manger Square are nowhere to be found. ""The city is empty from happiness, from joy, from kids, from Santa. There is no celebration this year,"" says Madeleine, a resident of Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank. The famous Christmas tree, usually in the middle of the square, is not there. There are no carols or Christmas market stands. Instead, a nativity scene, which shows a newborn Jesus surrounded by big rocks and barbed wire, has been installed as a tribute to the children of Gaza. In an unusually empty Nativity Church, Father Eissa Thaldjiya tells me his city feels like a shadow of itself. ""I've been a priest in this church for 12 years. I was born in Bethlehem, and I've never seen it like this - even during the Covid-19 pandemic,"" he says. ""We have brothers and sisters in Gaza - this is what makes it difficult to celebrate… But it's good to be united in prayers."" Jawdat Mikhael lives in Bethlehem, but his family is trapped in Northern Gaza. His parents, brother and dozens of other relatives have been sheltering in the Holy Family Church near Shejaiya in the east of Gaza City - an area devastated by Israeli bombardment. As Jawdat and I are talking, a call from his father Han'na Mikhael comes through. The line is crackly and connection is unstable - yet he hangs on for a glimpse of his dad. Han'na tells his son the family is doing ok. He says he's managed to venture out of the church for the first time in more than two weeks to try to find some food. He says that all is left around the church is rubble and that all the shops are burned. ""It's total destruction,"" he says. He wells up as he says that communications are down and that there is no water. Food is scarce, too - ""enough to keep you alive - not to fill your stomach,"" he says. Han'na cries as he tells me about how different Christmas was last year. ""On days like this, we'd be decorating the church. There'd be carols. People would come over to help. But now we're just praying to make it out of here alive."" The family has already suffered a terrible loss. A week ago, Jawdat's grandmother, Naheda Khalil Anton - who was also sheltering in the church in Gaza - was shot twice in the stomach as she was on her way to the bathroom. His aunt Samar Kamal Anton rushed to help her and was shot in the head. Jawdat shows me pictures of the immediate aftermath and the funeral. His family had been sheltering in the Holy Family Church since the beginning of the war. Now, they've buried their loved ones there. The family blames Israeli snipers for their death. The IDF says it will continue its investigation. Through tears, Han'na says that his two family members died before his eyes: ""It was a shock... It was unbearable."" He apologises to me for crying, and for not being able to speak much: ""I'm sorry, but it's just so difficult. We've endured so much."" A big bang is heard as we are talking, then a second sounds out before Jawdat reluctantly says goodbye to his dad. This morning in Bethlehem, church bells have been ringing as some locals gathered around the Jesus in the rubble installation and Arabic songs played out on the speakers, one calling forsalam- peace - for children. Dozens of people are in the middle holding a big Palestinian flag - waving it up and down. The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, is in Bethlehem for his traditional address. He was wearing the traditional black and white chequered Palestinian scarf. Before he entered the Church of Nativity, he said this was ""a very sad Christmas"". ""We are in a war, a terrible war. Our thoughts go first and foremost to Gaza, to our people in Gaza... Two million are suffering,"" he said. He added that ""a ceasefire is not enough"". ""We have to stop these hostilities and turn the page because violence generates only violence."" A few steps away from Manger Square, souvenir shops line Star Street on both sides but without the usual bustle of buying, selling and haggling. The famous Palestinian stitch scarves, cushion covers and artefacts hang outside shops, untouched. This is normally high season for the market. Not this year. ""We cannot celebrate with a lot of people killed in Gaza,"" says Abood Subouh, a shop owner in the local market just off Manger Square. He tells me that, sad as it is to see his city and his business this way, celebrating Christmas feels wrong this year: ""We can't be happy because we are not on the other side of the world. We are still in Palestine.""",2023-12-24T14:04:54.000Z

Tewkesbury Abbey's rubble nativity scene highlights children affected by warPublished24 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An abbey has broken from its traditional Christmas crib scene to highlight the suffering of children in Gaza and Israel. Bricks signifying rubble have been placed inside and around the crib at Tewkesbury Abbey. Rev Canon Nick Davies, vicar of Tewkesbury, said: ""It seemed right to remember those affected by the conflict as we pray for peace this Christmas. ""I hope it will move people and get them to stop and think."" The team at Tewkesbury Abbey were inspired to display the rubble crib after seeing an image of a church in Bethlehem which had created a similar scene witha baby doll representing Jesus lying amid a pile of stones. Mr Davies said thousands of visitors passed through Tewkesbury Abbey every Christmas and there would be an opportunity for people to make donations to the British Red Cross. ""We've got rubble around the crib and we've got rubble in the crib making that bed where you would usually expect to see straw,"" he said. ""That may seem a little bit of a shocking scene in some ways but for me the real shock is that there are children going to bed tonight in war zones, in bomb sites, in fear of missiles, and longing for peace. ""That's what we wanted to try and remind people of here. We've all seen those scenes on TV and we want to try to bring that reality home to people here."" This year marks the800th anniversary of Saint Francis' original nativity scene. In Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry saysmore than 20,000 people have been killed and 54,000 injured since the war began. Most of the dead are women and children, Hamas says. Israel says it takes steps to avoid civilian casualties, and blames Hamas for embedding itself in densely-populated areas.

"Tanker hit off India coast by drone from Iran, says USPublished24 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","A chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean was hit by a drone launched from Iran on Saturday, the US military says. A fire on board the Chem Pluto was extinguished. There were no casualties. Iran has not commented. Houthi rebels in Yemen - who are backed by Iran and support Hamas in its war with Israel - have recently used drones and rockets to target vessels in the Red Sea. But this event is the first of its kind so far away from there, according to maritime security firm Ambrey. The same company also said the vessel was heading from Saudi Arabia to India, and was linked to Israel. The Houthis have claimed to be targeting Israel-linked vessels over the conflict in Gaza. The US said the Chem Pluto was hit by ""a one-way attack drone fired from Iran"". It is believed to be the first time the US has publicly accused Iran of targeting a ship directly. It has previously accused Iran of being ""deeply involved"" in planning operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea - a charge Tehran has denied. However, Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned they could force the closure of waterways other than the Red Sea if ""America and its allies continue committing crimes"" in Gaza. The Pentagon statement said the Chem Pluto, ""a Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned, and Netherlands-operated chemical tanker"", was struck on Saturday at 10:00 local time (06:00 GMT). The hit caused structural damage. The incident took place 200 nautical miles (370km) south-west of the city of Veraval in India's Gujarat state, according to United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO). Ambrey said the event fell within an area considered a ""heightened threat area"" for Iranian drones. The Indian navy sent an aircraft and warships to offer assistance. The BBC was not able to independently verify the incident. In a separate development, the US Central Command (Centcom) said that on Saturday ""two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into international shipping lanes in the Southern Red Sea from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. No ships reported being impacted"". It also said the USS Laboon warship patrolling the area ""shot down four unmanned aerial drones originating from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen that were inbound"" to the American vessel. Later that day, a crude oil tanker reported being hit by a Houthi drone in the southern Red Sea, while another tanker saw a near miss. Many global shipping groups have suspended operations in the Red Sea due to the increased risk of attacks. The UK government has vowed to ensure the route's safety. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps told the Sunday Times newspaper that the UK was committed to repelling attacks on vessels - and would not allow the Red Sea to become a ""no-go area"". Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary David Cameron described Iran as a ""thoroughly malign influence in the region and in the world"". He said the Iranian leadership and its proxies needed to be sent an ""incredibly clear message that this escalation will not be tolerated"". Chris Farrell from Neptune P2P Group, a UK maritime security company, described nervousness in the region and observed that container ships were proving more likely to reroute than larger vessels.""Nobody really knows the situation out there,"" he told the BBC World Service's Weekend programme. ""Because of the lack of stability, that's creating the uncertainty with the clients and the shipping companies which are putting their assets within that region.""",2023-12-24T11:56:14.000Z

Israel-Gaza: Israel says it has arrested hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad membersPublished24 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel says it has arrested 200 members of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups in the past week and taken them into its territory for questioning. A statement said some of the suspects had been hiding among the civilian population and surrendered voluntarily. Israel says 700 Palestinian militants have been arrested since it launched its military operation and invasion of Gaza with the aim of eliminating Hamas. Hamas says mostly women and children are being killed by the Israelis. The BBC is unable to verify the claims. Israel has previously stressed that it takes steps to avoid civilian casualties, and blames Hamas for embedding itself in densely-populated areas. Israel launched its retaliatory operation after Hamas fighters crossed from Gaza into southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. More than 20,000 people have been killed and 53,000 injured in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Its update on Saturday said another 201 people had been killed and 368 others injured in the previous day alone. The UN earlier announcedthat its aid worker Issam al-Mughrabi, 56, had been killed in a strike - along with his wife, children and more than 70 members of his extended family. Israel announced that five more of its soldiers had been killed in fighting in Gaza, bringing the total to 144 to since it launched its ground operation. The military has kept up its bombing campaign in Gaza - ordering civilians to flee. On Saturday, it said one of its fighter jets had killed Hassah Atrash, a man it accused of smuggling weapons into Gaza to arm Hamas. There was no confirmation from Hamas. In a separate development on Saturday, US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed in a phone call Israel's ongoing military operation in Gaza. Mr Biden ""emphasised the critical need to protect the civilian population including those supporting the humanitarian aid operation, and the importance of allowing civilians to move safely away from areas of ongoing fighting"", the White House said. Meanwhile, Mr Netanyahu ""made it clear that Israel would continue the war until all of its goals have been achieved"", the Israeli PM's office said. The Israeli military has said it has almost full operational control of the north of the Gaza Strip, and is stepping up operations in the south. The UN said the latest evacuation order affected 150,000 people in the middle of the territory. ""People in Gaza are people,"" commented Thomas White from UNWRA, the agency for Palestinian refugees. ""They are not pieces on a checkerboard - many have already been displaced several times."" The latest evacuation order impacted people in the Bureij refugee camp, who were told to head towards Deir al-Balah city further south. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on Saturday that Bureij had been shelled - as had the Jabalia and Nuseirat camps, among other locations. A medic named Ziad told Reuters news agency he was left asking where to go, as there was ""no safe place"". An adviser to the Israeli prime minister has acknowledged ""terrible suffering"" in Gaza - but told the BBC this was because the territory's Hamas leadership ""don't give a hoot"" for the people there. The suffering ""shouldn't have happened"" but came about after a ""declaration of war"" by Hamas on 7 October, said Mark Regev. The questioning of 200 new suspects was announced in a joint statement on Saturday by the Israeli military and internal security service Shin Bet. The statement said this followed the arrests in Gaza of ""hundreds of suspects involved in terrorist activities"". The BBC is not able to independently verify all battlefield claims. However, it did verify video earlier this month showingthe detention of dozens of Palestinian men in the north Gaza Strip.",2023-12-24T02:19:47.000Z

Awni Eldous: The Palestinian boy who found YouTube fame after deathPublished24 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"After Awni Eldous died, his dreams came true. In a video posted in August 2022, he holds a microphone and smiles as he declares his ambitions for his YouTube gaming channel. ""So now folks, let me introduce myself: I am a Palestinian from Gaza, aged 12 years old. The aim of this channel is to reach 100,000 subscribers, or 500,000, or one million,"" he says. He ends the short video saying ""peace out"" to his 1,000 subscribers before walking out of view. Just over a year later, Awni became one of the first Palestinian children to be killed in the war. Relatives say Awni's family home was hit in an Israeli strike on 7 October, just hours after Hamas gunmen stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 240 hostage. Awni's video now has millions of views - and other videos in which he voicelessly plays computer games have millions more. Nearly 1.5 million people have subscribed to his YouTube channel. To his aunt, Ala'a, he was a happy, confident and helpful boy who would hold the door open for her. Another family member called him ""engineer Awni"" because of his love of computers. To others, this 13-year-old gamer has become a kind of symbol, representing the loss of children in the Gaza Strip. ""Please forgive us,"" reads one comment on his video. ""I wish we knew you before you died."" The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 20,000 people have been killed there since the war began - more than a third of them children. The UN children's agency (Unicef) has described it as the ""most dangerous place in the world to be a child"". The day of the Hamas attack, as Israel began to retaliate, Ala'a imagined a bomb destroying her family's home in Gaza City. That night, around 20:20, her phone lit up with messages from friends: Awni's family home had been hit. A different branch of the family lived on each floor of the three-storey building in the Zeitoun neighbourhood. Awni lived on a floor with his mum and dad, his two older sisters, and two younger brothers. The strike was also documented in October byhuman rights group Amnesty International. ""Two bombs fell suddenly on top of the building and destroyed it. My wife and I were lucky to survive because we were staying on the top floor,"" Awni's uncle Mohammed said. Both he and a neighbour said they had received no warning. ""It was sudden, boom,"" the neighbour said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not comment on this specific strike but said it was striking military targets and that Hamas had a ""documented practice of operating from nearby, underneath and within densely populated areas"". It said: ""The IDF's strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including the taking of feasible precautions and after an assessment that the expected incidental damage to civilians and civilian property is not excessive in relation to the expected military advantage from the attack."" It added that the IDF ""regrets any harm caused to civilians or civilian property as a result of its operations, and examines all its operations in order to learn and improve and ensure all activity was in accordance with operational procedures and the law"". Ala'a didn't want to believe the messages she was receiving. But after connecting to the wi-fi, she saw that a close friend of the family had shared a photo of her brother on social media with the caption: ""Rest in peace."" She ran to the hospital. ""They asked me to see the bodies but my husband refused… he wanted me to remember their beautiful faces when they were alive,"" she says in a Facebook message, sent from the south of Gaza, where she is now displaced. Ala'a says 15 members of her family were killed that night, among them Awni. She describes him as being a calm, helpful boy. His dad was a computer engineer and Ala'a says that for as long as she can remember, Awni would copy his father, pulling laptops apart and then trying to piece them back together. In photos Awni shared on his own Facebook page, he stands in front of a blackboard holding up a computer motherboard to fellow students, as he leads a technology lesson organised as part of a ""little teachers"" scheme. Pictures published on his school's Facebook page show him winning numerous awards. Shortly after his death, one of his teachers shared a photo with Awni, describing the boy's ""ever-lasting smile"". Outside of school, Ala'a says Awni loved spending time with his family. On one ""very wonderful night"", Ala'a says she watched a film with Awni and his siblings, sharing crisps and chocolates. The last time she saw him was at a family breakfast three weeks before his death, where she looked at her nephew and said: ""Awni is becoming a man."" Mostly, Awni loved computers and gaming, and he idolised the YouTubers who made careers out of his hobby. ""He wanted to be like them - to have followers and fans,"" Ala'a says. Awni started his channel in June 2020. His videos show him playing Pro Evolution Soccer, the car racing game Blur and the first-person shooting game Counter-Strike. Long captions give details of the games, the companies that made them and the dates of their release. In a video of Awni with an uncle, the pair promise a ""special"" range of content on the channel, declaring in unison: ""It will be a blast."" They grin and gesticulate as they take it in turns to talk. They say they plan to expand the channel to include vlogs and interviews. Ashraf Eldous, a distant relative of Awni who works as a programmer and helps run several YouTube channels, says the teenager would frequently contact him asking for advice. In messages from August 2022, shared with the BBC, Awni addresses ""brother Ashraf"" as he asks for YouTube tips. He would even take his father's phone in secret to ask for advice, Ashraf recalls. Ashraf says the last time he spoke to Awni's father, he was told: ""Take care of Awni. Answer his questions. He's ambitious."" ""His ambition was to be my competitor or colleague,"" Ashraf says. ""He created a YouTube channel. It wasn't that big, it didn't have any big views. Every start-up is hard at the beginning."" But after Awni's death in October, the views mounted when his fledgling channel caught the attention of established YouTubers, including Kuwaiti gamer AboFlah. In an emotional video now viewed almost nine million times, AboFlah cries and walks away from the camera. He has just discovered messages Awni had sent him on social media. One of those message says: ""Nothing compares to Palestine's winter in Gaza; the atmosphere is legendary. We're drinking sahlab [a sweetened milk drink]. It's so good. We're also eating roasted chestnuts. I hope you come to Palestine. Much love."" In another, Awni writes to AboFlah: ""You're a legend and a role model."" In the video, as AboFlah weeps, he says: ""It's such a shame for this child to die… This child is one of many others who are even younger than him. If God wills it, they'll be birds of paradise."" ""What you see is from the heart. I could not stop my tears,"" AboFlah tells the BBC, reflecting on the video he uploaded in October. ""It was very touching to hear that he looked up to me as a role model."" Asked why he thinks Awni has made such a big impact, AboFlah says: ""Fans see themselves in Awni. We are all Awni."" The teenager's entire family - his four brothers and sisters and mother and father - were killed alongside him. But his surviving relatives say they are proud of the fame he has found after death. ""It's a gift from God that so many people around the world love Awni,"" says Ala'a. ""He used to talk about it enthusiastically, about his channel. He is more happy in heaven now.""

Stakes are immense as Biden presses Israel to change coursePublished23 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The US has a new diplomatic objective in the Gaza War - to convince Israel to scale back its military operations in coming weeks. This is a crucial test of the Biden administration, and whether it succeeds could help determine the next phase of the war - as well as the president's own political fortunes back home. In public, the American effort to shape and restrain Israel's war has taken the form of advice rather than pressure. US officials - from Mr Biden to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin - have continually affirmed what they present as Israel's right to self-defence, and declared that a military operation which stops short of removing Hamas from power would only guarantee more attacks. As the conflict wore on, they've also become more outspoken about the need to protect civilians, warning that not doing so would land Israel with a ""strategic defeat"". Much of the world sees this approach as failing to temper a relentless bombing campaign that ranks among the most deadly and destructive this century. US officials insist their strategy has been the most effective way for the administration to influence an Israel traumatised by the unprecedented Hamas attack and disinclined to hold back. Yet American policy since that day has fractured Joe Biden's Democratic Party, lost him crucial support among young and Arab Americans and left the US looking isolated on the world stage. So far, President Biden's approach has achieved tangible, if limited, results. Persistent and painstaking diplomacy cleared a path to allowing some humanitarian aid into Gaza early on in the war, and helped broker a seven-day ceasefire to encourage hostage releases and the delivery of more assistance to desperate civilians. The Americans have certainly been very hands on. A steady stream of senior officials to the region has meant there's been someone in the room much of the time, having the difficult conversations face to face. ""These trips are important because we have constant issues that we're dealing with together with the Israelis,"" said a US official. Each of Mr Blinken's three visits to the region has been a whirlwind of activity and he's been keen to highlight continued American efforts to free the hostages, increase humanitarian aid and ensure the conflict does not expand to consume the entire Middle East. Progress on protecting civilians has been hard to see. This week the death toll in Gaza reached 20,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The Hamas raid on southern Israel on 7 October killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 taken hostage. Despite winning assurances that Israel would take steps to do so, Mr Blinken has spoken about the ""gap"" between the intent and the results. So January will be a crucial test of whether the administration can convince Israel to alter the dynamic of the war. It's pushing the Israelis to ""de-intensify"" military operations in Gaza and transition to more targeted tactics that produce fewer civilian casualties than the bombing-and artillery-driven campaign. It is a request that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly endorsed, although his defence minister has talked about the war moving into different phases. Critics of the American strategy say the US has been so cautious that it is effectively complicit in Israel's war. They say it should have more forcefully called for Israel to curtail a disproportionate military campaign and used the threat to withhold or set conditions on massive amounts of American military aid to rein in Israeli excess. But Aaron David Miller, who worked as a Middle East adviser in the State Department for some 25 years, calls the notion that the US could pressure Israel to change its policy in this case ""magical thinking."" ""The battlefield dynamic is beyond our capacity to control, let alone micromanage,"" he says, noting that Israel and Hamas are pursuing irreconcilable goals. Mr Miller, who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, says history shows that Israel has responded to rare occasions of US pressure only when American demands are tethered to a result they can accept. ""Pressing the Israelis on a matter of critical importance to them without offering a compelling alternative or an outcome that they can rationalise and justify, never works,"" he says. It's unclear if the ""bear hug"" strategy of publicly supporting Israel while preaching restraint behind closed doors will be enough to pull the Israelis across the line when it comes to scaling back the military campaign. In the meantime the Americans are contending with growing international isolation. Nowhere is this more evident than at the United Nations, where the US has opposed overwhelming demands for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. This week, with the UN warning of famine in Gaza, the US allowed the passage of a second Security Council resolution calling for more humanitarian access to Gaza. It did so after negotiating intensely to change language on the suspension of hostilities and mechanisms to monitor and speed up aid delivery. The administration wants no suggestion of a ceasefire that would constrain Israel's ability to destroy Hamas's leadership and military capability. But even some allies have been outspoken about this approach. ""The United States is losing respect, it's losing credibility as a powerful nation,"" former Irish President Mary Robinson, speaking on behalf of a group of global leaders known as The Elders, said in a recent interview on RTE News. ""The United States has called for restraint, but [the Israeli government] isn't listening."" And Arab partners of the US are alarmed by the radicalising effect of Israel's destruction in Gaza. ""Israel is jeopardising the standing of the United States and other Western friends of ours in our region,"" said Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi on a recent trip to Washington. ""It is not just killing Palestinians... it is also creating an environment in the region where the amount of hatred that's growing by the day, as a result of what we see unfolding in Gaza, is undoing 30 years of work that we all have invested in to normalise the idea of peace."" Mr Blinken has stressed that the regional and international community should also be pressing Hamas to lay down its arms and stop ""hiding behind civilians"". But in comments at a fundraising event last week, President Biden appeared to acknowledge some of the administration's internal frustrations. ""(Israel) has most of the world supporting it,"" the president said. ""But they're starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place."" Mr Biden is also facing growing domestic pressure to take a stronger line against Israel. Ina New York Times public opinion surveythis week, only 33% of registered American voters approved of the president's handling of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. A plurality, 44% to 39%, said Israel should end its military campaign. Heading into the 2024 presidential election year, the poll suggests the Biden administration is haemorrhaging support from key members of its electoral coalition. Among voters under 30, 46% said they sympathise more with the Palestinian side. Only 27% sided with the Israelis. Some prominent liberal members of the Democratic Party have pushed a resolution calling for a human rights report on Israel's use of American weapons that could potentially suspend US security assistance. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a left-wing independent who's an important ally of Joe Biden's, is sponsoring the resolution and has called Israeli conduct during the war ""reckless and immoral"". Separately, a group of House Democrats with national security backgrounds has written to the White House arguing that Mr Netanyahu's military strategy is not in the interests of either Israel or the US. And there've been various expressions of dissent from within Mr Biden's own administration. More than 800 staff members have supported a letter calling for an immediate ceasefire, although most have done so anonymously, and only one has resigned. ""I felt a lot of dissonance between coming into work every single day and serving this administration that I had previously so proudly done, and then feeling this sort of vacuum where the influence of a call to a ceasefire (would be) massive coming from the US president and our boss,"" one staffer told the BBC. Such sentiment underscores the difficult bind the US president finds himself in. Many world leaders, a significant number of administration insiders and about half the American public are increasingly unhappy with the current US strategy. But if the president starts to get tougher with the Israelis, the other half of Americans that back Israel would almost certainly object - and there's still no guarantee that his current critics would be satisfied. Scaling down the Israeli offensive is key. If it doesn't happen fast enough Mr Biden will have to seriously consider his next step. Especially as the calendar will soon flip to 2024 - the last year of his first presidential term. Domestic politics, always a factor in US foreign policy, will increasingly become a pressing concern for the president. For a man who promised a steady hand at the tiller after four years of Donald Trump's sometimes tumultuous foreign policy, the Gaza War has proven to be a formidable - and potentially grave - challenge to his political fortunes.",2023-12-23T02:16:36.000Z

Gadi Haggai: White House says US-Israeli hostage dead in GazaPublished22 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A dual US-Israeli citizen believed to have been abducted by Hamas was killed during the 7 October raid in Israel, the White House said on Friday. Gadi Haggai, 73, was reportedly taken alongside his wife Judi near Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel on 7 October. It is believed his remains are being held by Hamas in Gaza. It is unclear exactly how or where he died. Five to 10 US citizens are still being held hostage, according to the Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum. President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was ""heartbroken by the news that American Gad Haggai is now believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7"". He said he grieves for the Haggai family, and called their suffering ""intolerable"". ""I reaffirm the pledge we have made to all the families of those still held hostage: we will not stop working to bring them home,"" the president added. Mr Haggai, a retired chef and musician, was walking with his wife near Nir Oz on 7 October when the initial Hamas attack on southern Israel took place. He was described as a ""man full of humour who knew how to make those around him laugh"", as well as a gifted flautist and ""musician at heart"" by Liat Bell Sommer, a spokesperson for the Hostage and Missing Persons Families Forum - a group established by the families of those abducted by Hamas. During the attack, his wife alerted friends and family members that they had both been wounded. There has been no contact with the couple since. ""She said they were shot by terrorists on a motorcycle and that my dad was wounded really bad,"" the couple's daughter Iris Weinstein Haggai was quoted as saying by the Times of Israel. ""Paramedics tried to send her an ambulance. The ambulance got hit by a rocket."" Approximately 240 hostages were taken during the Hamas raid on Israel on 7 October, which left 1,200 people dead. According to Israeli government statistics cited by Reuters, 129 people remain in Gaza, including 22 who are dead. The rest of the hostages were repatriated during a brief November truce or have been recovered during Israeli military operations. The forum believes that between five and 10 of the remaining hostages hold US citizenship. Earlier this week, the White House said it believes eight Americans are still in Hamas captivity. In a White House briefing earlier this week, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the US is in ""serious talks and negotiations"" over another humanitarian pause and hostage exchange. Hamas, for its part, has ruled out any more hostage releases until Israel agrees to a ""full cessation of aggression"".",2023-12-22T22:09:00.000Z

"UN Security Council backs ramping up Gaza aid, but no ceasefirePublished22 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The UN Security Council (UNSC) has adopted a resolution urging more aid for the Gaza Strip, but falling short of a call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The vote followed days of negotiations to avoid a veto by the US, a permanent UNSC member and a key ally of Israel. UN chief António Guterres said the ""real problem"" to delivering aid was Israel's ongoing offensive. The UN has warned Gaza is at risk of famine if the war continues. Israel has launched a massive military campaign aimed at eliminating Hamas, following the 7 October attack in which militants killed at least 1,200 in southern Israel and took more than 240 hostage. At least 20,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Friday's resolution was introduced by the United Arab Emirates. Minutes before the vote, Russia - one of the five permanent members of the council - introduced an amendment to revert to an earlier draft calling for an immediate ceasefire. It argued the text gave Israel freedom of movement to further clear the Gaza Strip. The Russian amendment was defeated and both Russia and the US went on to abstain, while the other 13 members of the council backed the text that now calls for creating conditions ""for a sustainable cessation of hostilities"". The resolution said it aimed to introduce ""extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip"". It demanded that parties ""allow, facilitate and enable the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip"". The resolution calls for the appointment of coordinator to oversee a UN mechanism that will be set up with the goal of speeding up and streamlining the distribution of aid. Washington initially feared that would take away Israel's control of the screening process - but the resolution made clear it would be in consultation with all relevant parties. Reacting to the resolution, Hamas criticised what it said was an ""insufficient step"" to meet the humanitarian needs of people in Gaza, and accused the US of working hard to ""empty this resolution of its essence"". The resolution calls for ""the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages"" - and the Israel Defence Forces spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari urged the international community and international organisations to enforce it. While voting by the UN Security Council took place in New York, fighting continued to rage between Israel and Hamas. Israel has expanded its ground offensive in central Gaza after it issued an evacuation order to residents of Al-Bureij, telling them to move further south. Nearly 400 people died in Gaza in the last 48 hours, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. A quarter of households - roughly 500,000 people - are facing ""catastrophic conditions"", a UN food security agency found. It says the territory's entire population of roughly 2.2 million people is suffering acute food shortages. ""No-one in Gaza is safe from starvation,"" said Cindy McCain from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP). Trucks have been bringing aid into Gaza from Egypt for weeks, but the WFP recently estimated that just 10% of the food needed is currently getting into the territory. Talks have been taking place in Egypt to reach a new truce - similar to the week-long pause in fighting last month that saw 110 hostages released. But on Thursday they suffered a setback whenHamas said it would not agree to a release of some hostagesin exchange for a partial ceasefire. It said Palestinian groups had rejected the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war. Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire. After Friday's vote at the UNSC, the UK's Foreign Secretary David Cameron said ""a sustainable ceasefire must mean that Hamas is no longer there, able to threaten Israel with rocket attacks and other forms of terrorism"".",2023-12-22T21:26:24.000Z

""No-one in Gaza is safe from starvation,"" said Cindy McCain from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP). ""Humanitarian access is needed now for supplies to flow into and throughout Gaza, and for civilians to safely receive life-saving aid"". The report was published on Thursday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN body that assesses food security in places affected by conflict or natural disaster. It states that the ""quantities of commodities, including food, allowed to enter the Gaza Strip are largely insufficient"". On Friday, the UN's Security Council passed a resolution aiming to bring more aid into Gaza, but which stops short of calling for an immediate truce. Russia and the United States abstained on the vote, while the other 13 members of the council backed it. The resolution said it aimed to introduce ""extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip"" and called for ""the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages"". The resolution also requests that a ""senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator"" is appointed, with the responsibility for monitoring aid entering into the region. Trucks have been bringing aid into Gaza from Egypt for weeks, but the WFP recently estimated that just 10% of the food needed is currently getting into the territory. On Wednesday a convoy carrying aid from Jordan crossed into Gaza via Israel for the first time since the start of the war. Howaida Al-Daramali, a Palestinian woman who has been displaced to Khan Younis and who is also helping find shelter for other displaced families, said the limited aid being delivered ""only goes to one or two places"" and most people in Gaza were not receiving anything. ""We want this aid to be accompanied by teams who will be responsible for distributing it especially since the situation here is very difficult. Many people broke into the Red Crescent warehouses and looted them,"" she told the BBC. Meanwhile some families who were getting aid because they were in UN-run shelters were selling what they did not need at inflated prices, Ms al-Daramali said. ""Even with cash, there are no goods in the supermarket and no suppliers. We can buy only from people who receive aid and sell it at the school gates, which are dangerous places for us to reach,"" she said. People in Khan Younis were ""psychologically and economically devastated"", she said. The UN Security Council is meanwhile trying to agree on a vote calling for more aid to get into Gaza. The vote has been delayed for several days over the wording of the text. The US has expressed support for the latest draft resolutionafter earlier voicing ""widespread concerns"" with an earlier version that called for a ceasefire - something the US is against, saying it would only benefit Hamas. The new draft aims to create a mechanism to accelerate aid but makes clear it would involve relevant parties such as Israel. It also calls for all available routes to be used for deliveries but does not seek an immediate end to the fighting. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US Ambassador to the UN, described it as a ""very strong resolution that is fully supported by the Arab group"". Meanwhile, the fighting in and around Gaza continues. Hamas authorities on Thursday accused Israel of attacking the Rafah crossing - killing four people, including the director of the recently reopened Kerem Shalom crossing. Israel's military has not commented on the reported incident. Talks had been taking place in Egypt to reach a new truce - similar to the week-long pause in fighting last month that saw hostages released. But on Thursday they suffered a setback whenHamas said it would not agree to a release of some hostagesin exchange for a partial ceasefire. It said Palestinian groups had rejected the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war. Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire with Hamas, saying it aims to destroy the group. More than 240 Israeli hostages were captured on 7 October when Hamas broke through the fortified perimeter with Israel, killing 1,200 people. A total of 110 hostages were released in the truce last month. Earlier this week, Hamas said the number of people killed in Gaza in 10 weeks of fighting had passed 20,000.",2023-12-22T17:42:48.000Z

Israel Gaza: Hamas says no more hostage releases until war endsPublished22 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hamas, the group which controls the Gaza Strip, has ruled out any more hostage releases until Israel agrees to a ""full cessation of aggression"". Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hamas fighters in Gaza since a truce earlier this month when more than 100 hostages were freed. Around 120 people abducted from Israel on 7 October are believed to be still in captivity in Gaza. Efforts continue at the United Nations to pass a resolution on the war. The US has said it still has serious concernsover the draft UN Security Council resolution, with voting now postponed to Friday. Fighting continues in Gaza, with Israel bombarding the north and south of the territory and Hamas firing rockets at Tel Aviv. Among the Palestinians reported killed were the director of the police station in the southern city of Khan Younis and a daughter of the head of the Gaza health ministry. The week-long truce this month brought an increased flow of aid into Gaza, where the UN has warned that the population is at risk of famine if the war between Israel and Hamas continues. Negotiations on a new trucehave been taking placein Cairo, Egypt, though initial talks on Wednesday bore no agreement. In a statement, Hamas said: ""There is a Palestinian national decision that there should be no talk about prisoners or exchange deals except after a full cessation of aggression."" It is unclear to which other Palestinian factions the statement was referring. Islamic Jihad, a smaller group in the Gaza Strip, is among those known to also be holding Israeli hostages. The Hamas statement puts the Israeli government in a very difficult position. It has said it thinks the best way to get the release of hostages is military pressure on Hamas and by staging rescue operations. But so far that approach has not really worked. Only one hostage - Ori Megidish - has actually been rescued. The government is also under huge pressure from the relatives of the hostages still being held, with some telling it the strategy of force is not working. Hamas is putting pressure on Israel to stop the war altogether but without any guarantee that the group is going to stop its armed actions. So the Israeli government is extremely reluctant to stop fighting until it feels it has completely degraded Hamas capability and it has not done that yet. This will be a huge disappointment for the people of Gaza, who are desperate for this war to stop. Early on Friday, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry put the overall death toll there since 7 October at 20,057, including at least 8,000 children and 6,200 women. When Hamas and their allies broke through the heavily guarded perimeter with Israel on 7 October they killed 1,200 people.",2023-12-22T05:54:17.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: US backs UN Security Council vote on Gaza aid boostPublished22 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The UN Security Council is moving closer to a vote on humanitarian aid for Gaza after the US expressed support for the latest draft resolution. The vote, now delayed until Friday, had been in limbo after the US voiced ""widespread concerns"" with a draft. Washington had said it was concerned the resolution, put forward by the United Arab Emirates, could ""actually slow down"" aid into Gaza. The latest announcement from the US comes after some two weeks of talks. All week, the Security Council has repeatedly postponed the draft resolution aimed at bringing in some form of ceasefire, as wrangling continued over the language. The original draft called for a sustainable cessation of hostilities, but the final version calls for creating the conditions for one. It no longer calls for the use of all land, sea and air routes for deliveries - just all available routes. It still creates a mechanism to accelerate aid - but makes clear that's in consultation with relevant parties such as Israel. Emerging from a closed-door session on Thursday night, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield rejected claims the latest draft had been watered down, arguing it is ""a very strong resolution"". She called it ""a resolution that we can support"", but declined to say if the US would vote 'yes' or abstain. The key sticking point on Thursday appeared to be over the text's proposal to have a UN mechanism to monitor aid into Gaza - something the Arab group of nations insisted must be part of any meaningful resolution. But the US said that could take away Israel's control of the screening process - and it asked for another delay to allow time for discussions with Egypt on how such a monitoring mechanism could work for all parties. Currently, Israel monitors all aid and fuel deliveries to Gaza. Earlier this month, the majority of the Security Council - 13 of 15 members - supported a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza,but the US vetoed it and the UK abstained.The US, like Israel, has objected that a ceasefire would benefit Hamas - and instead the US supports proposed pauses in fighting. But since then, pressure has been growing for fighting to be paused. Earlier this week, Hamas said the number of people killed in Gaza in 10 weeks of fighting had passed 20,000. On Thursday, the UN's World Food Programme warned that Gaza was at risk of famine if the war continued. WFP spokesperson Shaza Moghraby said: ""We cannot wait for famine to be declared before we act. ""We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the opening of all border crossings and the resumption of commercial cargo to provide relief, put an end to the suffering and avert the very serious threat of famine."" Talks had been taking place in Egypt to reach a new truce - similar to the week-long pause in fighting last month that saw hostages released.

Claudine Gay: New problems found in Harvard president's workPublished22 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Harvard's president will request corrections to her dissertation after three new instances of ""inadequate citation"" were found in her essays. Claudine Gay has been facing mounting accusations of plagiarism. On Wednesday, a congressional committee said it would expand its ongoing investigation into antisemitism at Harvard to include her academic papers. Chairwoman Virginia Foxx said the inquiry would see if students and staff are held to the same academic standard. The BBC contacted Harvard's governing body for comment. Dr Gay has faced calls to resign for her testimony during a congressional hearing about antisemitism on campus. And on Wednesday, the Republican-led Committee on Education and the Workforce said it would broaden its look at Harvard to cover Ms Gay's own works. Ms Foxx, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, said in a letter to the leader of Harvard's board on Wednesday that the prestigious institution could be violating the public's trust. ""Our concern is that standards are not being applied consistently, resulting in different rules for different members of the academic community,"" she said. The committee is demanding that Harvard submit any documents and communications related to the plagiarism inquiry into Dr Gay. The lawmakers also want a list of any academic disciplinary actions taken against Harvard faculty or students since 2019. It asks that the board respond to the committee by 29 December. Harvard is a private institution that receives hundreds of millions of dollars of public funding each year. It has $50bn (£40bn) in assets. The three corrections to Dr Gay's 1997 PhD dissertation were announced as part of a review into her work conducted by the Harvard Corporation, the university's most senior governing body. The review found three instances of ""inadequate citation"" in her dissertation. Last week, the board said it had checked Dr Gay's academic history and found two published papers that needed additional citations. But it added that she did not violate ""standards for research misconduct"". Harvard's board has said it became aware of plagiarism allegations against Dr Gay in October, but has unearthed no violations of university policies. Recent reports published by US outletsCNNand theWashington Free Beaconclaim further instances of plagiarism. This includes her 1997 dissertation in which she allegedly copied a full paragraph nearly verbatim from a paper published one year earlier. The Free Beacon, a conservative publication, said it has discovered at least 40 cases of plagiarism. She and other university leaders were accused of insensitivity and hypocrisy when discussing efforts to stem antisemitism on their campuses amid the Israel-Gaza war. During tense questioning, Dr Gay said calls for the killing of Jews were abhorrent. She added, however, that it would depend on the context whether such comments would constitute a violation of Harvard's code of conduct regarding bullying and harassment. The university later announced it had chosen not to discipline Dr Gay for her testimony, and she also apologised in an interview with the school's student newspaper.",2023-12-22T01:59:40.000Z

False claims of staged deaths surge in Israel-Gaza warPublished22 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The mother and grandfather of five-month-old Palestinian baby Muhammad Hani al-Zahar held his dead body in front of a hospital following the resumption of hostilities in Gaza on the first day of December. But when footage of the grief-stricken family holding the body in their arms went viral on social media, many posts falsely claimed Muhammad was merely a doll, and not a real baby. These claims were amplified in an article by the Jerusalem Post, an influential Israeli newspaper, which showed an image of Muhammad in rigor mortis after his death and said it proved he was a doll. After a backlash, the paper removed the article from its website, saying on X (formerly Twitter) thatthe report ""was based on faulty sourcing"". A few weeks earlier, a video of Israeli siblings Rotem Mathias, 16, and his two sisters, Shakked and Shir, went viral online.Rotem witnessed his parents get killed by Hamas gunmenon 7 October as they sheltered in their house in a kibbutz near the border with Gaza. The viral video featured edited clips from the siblings' interviews with US outlets ABC and CNN days after the attack. It falsely claimed that they were ""crisis actors"" who were lying about their parents' deaths and struggling to hold their laughter in front of cameras. These are just two examples - viewed millions of times each - showcasing the social media schism in the Israel-Gaza war that has brought denial of atrocities and human suffering to the forefront of online debate about the conflict. One of the key terms used to deny or minimise human suffering in Gaza is ""Pallywood"", a disparaging combination of ""Palestine"" and ""Hollywood"". Its proponents claim fake or staged footage of Palestinian ""crisis actors"" posing as genuine civilian casualties is regularly shared online to influence public opinion and deceive global media. A BBC Verify analysis suggests that on X alone, the term ""Pallywood"" has seen the largest spike in the number of mentions in the past 10 years. During previous flare-ups of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in 2014, 2018 and 2021 the word ""Pallywood"" consistently peaked at either 9,500 or 13,000 mentions in a single month on X. After the 7 October Hamas attack, the number of mentions peaked at 220,000 in November. BBC Verify found that among those sharing the term ""Pallywood"" on social media in the past months, including X, Facebook and Instagram, were Israeli officials, celebrities and popular bloggers from Israel and the US. On the other hand, while supporters of the Palestinians do not have a single term used to deny atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October in Israel, posts making such claims routinely get millions of views on social media. Some falsely say that Hamas did not kill civilians on that day, or that the scale of civilian casualties has been massively exaggerated. Some even go further, falsely claiming that most of the victims were actually killed by the Israel Defense Forces, not Hamas. Experts specialising in reconciliation efforts worry that viral disinformation which denies the other side's suffering can be dehumanising, and may impact the longer-term prospects of mending the relations between the communities affected. ""The biggest risks, I think, are the erosion of trust and the erosion of empathy,"" said Harriet Vickers, programme lead at the Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace, a charity that supports victims of conflict, political violence and acts of terror. ""It undermines the ability to even begin approaching reconciliation efforts."" She added that false narratives and dehumanising rhetoric can also ""have a profound effect beyond those that are directly impacted by violence, and can actually further the hurt that is being done to those individuals"". False narratives about ""crisis actors"" or atrocity denial are not new to those who study disinformation. The concept of ""crisis actors"" in particular - that is people who pretend or are paid to act out some particular tragedy or disaster - has been popular among promoters of conspiracy theories for years. It was notoriously used to allege that parents of dead children inthe Sandy Hook school shooting in the USwere somehow faking their personal tragedies. In the past few years similar viral claims were posted about thekilling of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha, and victims of the war in Syria. But the volume of dehumanising rhetoric posted during this war has surprised even those who deal with such content on a daily basis. Eliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative website Bellingcat that has covered the wars in Syria and Ukraine in recent years, says the volume of disinformation in the current Israeli-Gaza war is ""unique to this conflict"". ""I've seen the kind of same intensity of toxicity and vile responses and disinformation, the way they treat women and children and that kind of stuff, with Syria, with Ukraine and so many different topics - just there are more people doing it,"" he told the BBC. Mr Higgins added that because many people have had very strong opinions about either side of the conflict for years, ""there are more people who are sharing stuff because it is resonating with them emotionally"". ""They don't really care if it's true or not, it just feels true to them."" Back in November, a video showing makeup and fake blood being applied to a child actor's face was posted on X by Ofir Gendelman, the Israeli prime minister's spokesperson to the Arab world. ""See for yourselves how they fake injuries and evacuating 'injured' civilians, all in front of the cameras. Pallywood gets busted again,"" Mr Gendelman said in a post that was viewed millions of times before being deleted. The video was, in fact, behind-the-scenes footage from a 45-second Lebanese film made in tribute to Gazans and posted online in October. Director Mahmoud Ramzi, who took to Instagram topersonally debunk the false claim made about his film, told the BBC that in the end, the misinformation might have backfired, with the controversy helping his film reach a much bigger audience. The BBC approached Mr Gendelman for comment but he has not responded. Others have expressed concern for the real people who find themselves in the middle of online disinformation wars. James Longman, the ABC correspondent who interviewed Rotem and his sisters, says watching Rotem recount the death of his parents brought him and his cameraman to tears. ""He was in tears, his sister was in tears, their grandfather, who was with us. Our cameraman, the hospital porters, the nurses, the doctors, and I was in tears. I mean all of us sitting there listening to what he had to say,"" he told the BBC. ""It was extraordinary to hear him say it, to watch his reactions as he explained what had happened."" Mr Longman said he was shocked when he saw false claims about the siblings being shared online and took to X to debunk it. His post was shared widely, and led to at least one of the viral messages about the siblings being subsequently deleted by the person who posted it. ""But it doesn't make it any less horrible for Rotem's family,"" Mr Longman said.",2023-12-22T01:20:50.000Z

Israel Gaza: 'I walked my kids past explosions and rotting corpses'Published21 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"After weeks of Israeli bombing, on 16 November Jehad El-Mashhrawi and his young family fled their home in northern Gaza. The BBC Arabic cameraman shares a vivid and shocking account of what he, his wife and children experienced as they headed south. Warning: This story contains graphic descriptions which may be distressing We left in such a hurry. We were in the middle of baking some bread and realised the houses opposite us were being bombed, one by one. I knew it would soon be our turn. We had packed some bags in case this happened but everything was so rushed we forgot to take them. We didn't even shut the front door. We had waited to leave because we didn't want to move my elderly parents and we had taken years to save up to build our house in al-Zeitoun, but in the end we had to go. My baby son, Omar, died there in November 2012, killed when shrapnel hit our house in another war with Israel and I couldn't risk losing any more children. I knew that in the south there was no electricity, no water and people had to queue for hours to use a toilet. But in the end, grabbing just a bottle of water and some leftover bread, we joined thousands of others making the dangerous journey down the Salah al-Din road to the south, where Israel said it was safe. Lots of my family walked together - my wife Ahlam, our four sons, who are two, eight, nine and 14 years old, my parents, brothers, sisters, cousins and their children. We walked for hours and knew that eventually we would have to go through an Israeli checkpoint that was set up during the war. We were nervous and my children kept asking: ""What will the army do to us?"" We came to a stop about two-thirds of a mile (1km) from the checkpoint and joined a huge queue of people that filled the entire road. We spent more than four hours waiting there and my father fainted three times. There were Israeli soldiers watching us from bombed-out buildings on one side of the road and more on an empty plot of land on the other side. As we edged closer to the checkpoint we saw more soldiers above us in a tent on a hill. We think they managed the checkpoint remotely from there, watching us through binoculars and using loudspeakers to tell us what to do. There were two open-sided shipping containers near the tent. All the men had to pass through one and the women through the other, with cameras constantly trained on us. When we had gone through, Israeli soldiers asked to see our IDs and we were photographed. It was like judgement day. I saw about 50 people detained, all men, including two of my neighbours. One young man was stopped because he had lost his documents and couldn't remember his ID number. Another man next to me in the queue was called a terrorist by an Israeli soldier, before he too was taken away. They were told to strip down to their underwear and sit on the ground. Some were later asked to get dressed and leave, while others were blindfolded. I saw four blindfolded detainees, including my neighbours, taken behind a sand hill by a demolished building. When they were out of sight, we heard gunfire. I have no idea whether they were shot or not. Separately, other people who made the same journey as me were contacted by a colleague of mine in Cairo. One of them, Kamal Aljojo, said that just after he went through the checkpoint a week earlier, he had seen dead bodies, but he didn't know how they had died. My colleague also spoke to a man called Muhammed who went through the same checkpoint on 13 November. ""A soldier asked me to strip off all of my clothes, even my underwear,"" Muhammed told the BBC. He added: ""I was naked in front of everyone walking past. I felt ashamed. Suddenly a female soldier pointed her gun at me and laughed before quickly moving it away. I was humiliated."" Muhammed said he had to wait naked for about two hours before he was allowed to go. Although my wife, children, parents and I all got through the checkpoint safely, two of my brothers were delayed. While we were waiting for them, an Israeli soldier shouted at a group of people in front of us who were trying to go back towards the containers to check on their relatives, who had been held up. He used a loudspeaker to tell them to move on and to stay at least 300yds (300m) away, then a soldier started shooting in the air in their direction to intimidate them. We had heard a lot of gunshots while we were queueing. Everyone was crying and my mother was sobbing: ""What happened to my sons? Did they shoot them?"" After well over an hour my brothers finally appeared. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that ""individuals suspected of affiliations with terrorist organisations"" were detained for preliminary inquiries, and if they remained suspects they were transferred to Israel for further questioning. Others were ""promptly released"", it said. It said clothes had to be removed to check for explosive vests or other weapons and detainees were clothed as soon possible. It said it did not aim to ""undermine the security and dignity of the detainees"" and that the IDF ""operates in accordance with international law"". The IDF also said it ""does not shoot at civilians moving along the humanitarian corridor from the north to the south"", but when young men tried to move in the opposite direction they ""were met with shots for the purposes of dispersal, after they were told with a loudspeaker not to advance towards the position of the troops and continued to do so"". It added that the sound of shooting was common and ""the sound of gunfire alone does not constitute an indication of shooting from a specific place or of a certain type"". My wife and I felt relieved as we moved on and the checkpoint disappeared from sight behind us, but we had no idea that the hardest part of the journey was yet to come. As we walked further south, I saw about 10 bodies in different places by the roadside. Other scattered, rotting body parts, were covered in flies with birds pecking at the remains. They gave off one of the foulest smells I have ever experienced. I couldn't bear the thought of my children seeing them so I screamed at the top of my lungs, telling them to look at the sky and keep walking. I saw a burned-out car with a severed human head inside. The hands of the headless rotting corpse were still holding the steering wheel. There were also bodies of dead donkeys and horses, some reduced to skeletons, and huge piles of rubbish and spoiled food. Then an Israeli tank appeared on a side road, moving towards us at breakneck speed. We were frightened and in order to get away, we had to run over corpses. Some people in the crowd tripped on the bodies. The tank changed course about 20yds (20m) before it reached the main road. Suddenly, next to the road, a building was bombed. The explosion was terrifying and shrapnel flew everywhere. I wanted the world to swallow us up. We were shaken and exhausted but carried on towards Nuseirat camp. We arrived there in the evening and had to sleep on the pavement. It was freezing. We put my jacket around our middle sons, tucking their hands into the sleeves to try to keep them warm. We covered our youngest with my shirt. I have never been so cold in all my life. When the BBC asked about the tank and the bodies, the IDF said that ""during the day, tanks move on routes that intersect with the Salah al-Din road, but there was no case in which tanks moved towards civilians moving from north to south of the Gaza Strip on the humanitarian corridor"". The IDF said it did not know of any cases of piles of corpses on the Salah al-Din road but there were times when Gazan vehicles ""abandoned bodies during the journey, which the IDF subsequently evacuated"". The next morning we set off early for Khan Younis, Gaza's second largest city. We paid someone to take us part of the way in a cart pulled by a donkey. Then at Deir al-Balah, we got on a bus that was only meant to carry 20 people, but 30 people got on board. Some sat on the roof and others clung to the doors and windows from the outside. In Khan Younis, we tried to find a safe place to stay at a UN-run school that had been turned into a shelter, but it was full. We ended up renting a warehouse under a residential building instead and stayed there for a week. My parents, brother and sisters decided to stay in Khan Younis, but after the local market was bombed, my wife and I decided to take our children further south to Rafah to be with her family. They managed to get a lift in a car and I joined them later by bus, but it was so full I had to hang on to the outside of the door. We are now renting a small outhouse with a roof made of tin and plastic. There is nothing to protect us from falling shrapnel. Everything is expensive and we can't get many of the things we need. If we want drinking water, we have to queue for three hours and we don't have enough food for three meals a day, so we don't eat lunch any more, only breakfast and dinner. My son used to have an egg every day. An egg - can you imagine? I can't even give him that now. All I want to do is leave Gaza and be safe with my children, even if that means living in a tent.

Starbucks blames 'misrepresentation' after Israel Gaza protestsPublished20 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Starbucks has published a letter calling for peace and blaming ""misrepresentation"" of its views for vandalism of its stores. Themessagefrom boss Laxman Narasimhan comes as the coffee giant grapples withprotestsand boycott campaigns on social media tied to the Israel-Gaza war and a union fight in the US. Reports of slower sales have also hit its share price. It is unclear if the message will ease tensions. In the letter to staff, which was posted on the firm's website, Mr Narasimhan did not mention the Middle East explicitly but said that ""conflicts in many parts"" had unleashed violence, hate, lies and weaponized speech, ""all of which we condemn"". ""Cities around the world - including here in North America - have seen escalating protests. Many of our stores have experienced incidents of vandalism. We see protestors influenced by misrepresentation on social media of what we stand for,"" he said. He added: ""Our stance is clear. We stand for humanity."" Starbucks was vaulted into debates over the Middle East when the union working to organise baristas in the US posted a message on social media expressing ""solidarity"" with Palestine, shortly after the 7 October attack by Hamas. The post, which the union said was not authorised by leaders, spread rapidly despite being taken down, and sparked backlash against the firm. Starbucks said it disagreed with the union's statement. Ithas describedits official position as condemning ""violence in the region"". It subsequently sued the union for trademark infringement, saying use of its logo was confusing the public and it needed to protect the safety of workers and halt business damage. The back-and-forth spurred calls for boycotts by people in both pro-Israel and pro-Palestine camps around the world. The issue has been mixed with an already bitter union fight in the US. In late November, the Starbucks Workers United union, which represents staff at about 350 of the company's roughly 10,000 stores in the US, staged a walkout. It wanted to call attention to its cause and to hard-line tactics it says it has faced from the company, which US labour officials have ruled has broken labour laws repeatedly. Some on social media say the boycotts and walkout have hurt the company's image and share price, which had surged after a strong earnings update but has recently fallen more than 7%. Analysts following the company, though, said the fall reflects expectations of weaker sales driven primarily by wider economic forces. A company spokesman said the swirl of misinformation had become untenable. He said Mr Narasimhan was focused on addressing employees who have had to deal with customers raising complaints sparked by the misrepresentation. In the letter Mr Narasimhan said his goal for 2024 was to ""reinvigorate our partner culture"". The company also recently said it had re-approached the union for talks, a significant shift in tone. ""It is time to re-stitch the fabric of the green apron for all partners,"" he wrote. He concluded: ""In my daily meditation, I pray for peace — immediately."" The letter did not appear to assuage the firm's critics, with some accusing it of being vague. Michelle Eisen, a Starbucks Worker United leader, said the company was still retaliating against pro-union workers. ""Starbucks claims to want a new relationship with workers and our union, but actions speak louder than words,"" she said. Starbucks is one of the most high-profile firms to be swept up in the conflict over the Israel-Gaza war. Zara and M&S have both been criticised for adverts filmed long before the conflict, which people criticised for seeming to make light of death in Gaza. Companies such as McDonald's, Google, and TikTok have also faced scrutiny, from staff and customers, over what they did or did not say about the conflict.",2023-12-20T20:30:41.000Z

Plea to help families flee Gaza to join relatives in UKPublished20 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Scots Palestinian doctor whose family are stuck in Gaza is calling on the UK government to help them escape the war zone. Dr Lubna Hadoura, who lives and works as a surgeon in Fife, says British citizens should be able to sponsor dependants so they can flee. Her elderly mother, three sisters, their husbands and children are trapped - some in Gaza city, others in Rafah. The UK government says it is helping people leave Gaza - but Dr Hadoura believes more needs to be done. ""What I'm asking the British government to do is put up some scheme similar to the family scheme that was operated with the Ukraine war allowing British citizens to reunite with their family that are not British citizens,"" she said. ""Me and the rest of the family are more than capable of supporting them and accommodating them so we will not be using any public funding whatsoever, but I want the assistance in getting them here."" Hamas gunmen attacked Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. The Israeli military responded with air strikes on Gaza, and launched a ground offensive. The Hamas-run Gaza government says 20,000 people have been killed in the military campaign. The UN estimates that 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have fled or lost their homes, and there is growing concern about the limited scope for aid agencies to help them. Dr Hadoura said her 79-year-old mother Raeesa Albahnasawi has had to move seven times since October, despite health and mobility issues. She said communication was extremely difficult and that she did not know what the food and drink situation was, and whether or not her mother had her medication. ""I cannot describe how worried I am. The fact that we have not heard from one of my sisters for three weeks just shatters me."" And she added: ""The feeling of helplessness is enormous. ""Even though I'm putting up with this, I don't know how much longer I can."" Dr Hadoura said that some other countries had come up with schemes which allowed citizens who had family in Gaza to get their relatives out. She said she was happy to sponsor her family to come to the UK. The UK government said more than 270 British nationals and their dependants had so far left Gaza so far, and that any dependants of British citizens who needed a visa could apply for one. ""We are working around the clock to get the rest of those out who want to leave,"" it said. ""We have a team on the ground in Cairo and at the Rafah crossing providing consular assistance."" But Dr Hadoura said the situation in Gaza made it impossible for her family to get a visa and that the current application system was not fit for purpose. She added that Palestinians could not get through to access the consular services in Egypt without a foreign passport or a visa.",2023-12-20T19:51:20.000Z

Israel Gaza: What Gaza's death toll says about the warPublished20 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"At least 20,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been reported killed since Israel began bombing the territory in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attacks. BBC Verify examines what Gaza's death toll reveals about the conflict. On average, nearly 300 people have been killed each day since the start of the conflict, excluding the seven-day ceasefire, data from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry indicates. The World Health Organization's regional emergency director Richard Brennan says he considers these casualty figures trustworthy. Counting the dead is a challenge in any war zone, and doctors in Gaza say the death toll is likely to be significantly higher as it does not include bodies buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings or those not taken to hospitals. BBC Verify has looked in detail at the figures, how they compare with other conflicts and the impact on Gaza's young population. The pace of killing in this war has been ""exceptionally high"", says Prof Michael Spagat, who specialises in examining death tolls in conflicts around the world, such as the 2003 Iraq war, Colombia's civil conflict, wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as previous wars between Israel and Gaza. ""Within the series of Gaza wars stretching back to 2008, the current one is unprecedented both for the number of people killed and for the indiscriminateness of the killing,"" he adds. The 20,000 figure represents almost 1% of Gaza's 2.2 million population. The BBC has spoken to military experts who have described the wide variety of bombs used by Israel - some about 100lb and others as large as 2000lb - as having directly contributed to the scale of fatalities in this conflict. Being near the impact of the largest bombs is like ""surfing on the Earth as the shockwave momentarily liquefies the ground"", says Marc Garlasco, a former senior intelligence analyst at the Pentagon and former UN war crimes investigator, who spoke to victims and witnesses of these bombs. What makes them even more devastating is that Gaza has a very high population density. It is just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km (six miles) wide. On average, before the conflict, there were more than 5,700 people per sq km in Gaza - very similar to the average density in London. Israel began its military campaign in Gaza in the wake of Hamas' attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed, most of them civilians. Three months later, it is facing mounting pressure over the number of civilian casualties. In worldwide conflicts between 2011 and 2021, on average 90% of fatalities were civilians when explosive weapons were used on populated areas, according to the research and advocacy group Action on Armed Violence. According to US intelligence assessments seen by CNN, in this war, Israel haddropped more than 29,000 bombs on Gazasince the war began and mid-December, with 40-45% of these unguided. These unguided bombs ""can miss their target by up to 30m, which is the difference between hitting a Hamas HQ and an apartment packed with civilians"", says Mr Garlasco, who has worked on three previous wars in Gaza and is now a military adviser for the Dutch peace organisation PAX. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it takes precautionary measures in order to avoid damage to the civilian population. It says these measures include warnings before strikes in cases where it is possible to do so. Israel has also insisted that its record on killing civilians has been better than those in other international conflicts. The IDF says it will ""abort attacks when we see unexpected civilian presence. We choose the right munition for each target - so it doesn't cause unnecessary damage."" Israel also says that Hamas uses Gaza's civilian population as human shields. Women and children make up about 70% of those who have been killed in Gaza during the current conflict, says the Hamas-run health ministry. However, Hamas's figures do not distinguish between male civilians and combatants. The previous official breakdown of the deaths from Hamas's Government Media Office on 19 December, which stood at 19,667, said that more than 8,000 children and 6,200 women had been killed. It also said that 310 medical personnel, 35 civil defence personnel and 97 journalists had been killed - all of them civilians. The war is having a particularly devastating impact on Gaza's children. Nearly half of the territory's population is under 18, according to data released in 2022 by the health ministry. There have been over 52,000 people injured in the conflict so far, the health ministry says. While there are no up-to-date figures for the number of children injured, on 3 November there were reportedly 24,173 injured - comprising 8,067 children, 5,960 women and 10,146 men. Gaza is now the ""most dangerous place in the world to be a child"", according to the United Nation's child agency, Unicef. ""Entire neighbourhoods, where children used to play and go to school, have beenturned into stacks of rubble, with no life in them,"" said Adele Khodr, Unicef's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. Each conflict is unique in the way it is fought, but the experts the BBC has spoken to agree that the rate of killing in Gaza is significantly bigger than in others fought recently. ""What we're seeing in terms of civilian deaths has already far outpaced rates of harm from any given conflict we have documented,"" said Emily Tripp, director of Airwars, an organisation which has monitored civilian deaths in wars and conflicts since 2014. The former Pentagon intelligence analyst Marc Garlasco said: ""To find a similar density of high explosives used in a small populated area, we might have to go back to the Vietnam war for a comparable example - like the 1972 Christmas bombing, when some 20,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Hanoi during Operation Linebacker II."" An estimated 1,600 Vietnamese civilians were killed in the Christmas bombings. By contrast, US-led coalition air and artillery strikes killed fewer than 20 civilians per day, on average, during the four-month offensive to drive IS out of the Syrian city of Raqqa in 2017, according to Amnesty International. It is unclear how many civilians lived there at the time, but UN officials estimated that there were between 50,000 and 100,000. Additionally, over 160,000 civilians reportedly fled their homes and became internally displaced at the time. And an Associated Pressinvestigationsuggested that between 9,000 and 11,000 civilians were killed in the nine-month battle between US-backed Iraqi forces and IS for the Iraqi city of Mosul which ended in 2017. This amounts to an estimated fewer-than-40 civilian deaths per day, on average. Mosul had an estimated population of less than two million people when IS captured the city in 2014. During the almost two years of the Ukraine war, the United Nationsestimatesthat at least 10,000 civilians have been killed. However, the UN's human rights monitoring mission has also cautioned that the actual figure may be significantly higher given the challenges and time required for verification. And comparing casualty rates in different conflicts is difficult, in part because varying methodologies are used for estimating deaths. Israel has stated its goal is to destroy Hamas but has not been clear how many of its members it has killed. Officials have previously pointed to ""thousands"" and elsewhere ""7,000"". Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the Israeli and UK governments and others. But when asked directly, the IDF said it ""does not have an exact number on the number of Hamas terrorists killed"". News agency AFP reported that senior Israeli officials had suggested Israel had killed two Palestinian civilians for every one Hamas fighter. That ratio was described by the IDF's spokesman Jonathan Conricus as ""tremendously positive"", to CNN. The BBC has not been able to establish a clear method of verifying the number of fighters killed. Prof Michael Spagat, said he would ""not be at all surprised"" if around 80% of those killed were civilians. The IDF's numbers for combatants killed ""have been all over the place, devoid of details and without explanations"", he added. There are ""no reliable figures"" for the ratio of civilians to combatants killed in Gaza, say Hamit Dardagan and John Sloboda of Iraq Body Count, an organisation that examines the number of deaths in the Iraq war.

'I don't want to be a number': Gazans live in fear of dyingPublished20 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The children at al-Aqsa hospital do not think of the dead of Gaza in figures of thousands. Theirs is a more intimate reckoning. It is counted in beloved faces that have vanished into the fire and rubble of the war. Thirteen-year-old Rama Zaqout was sleeping when an Israeli missile struck the mosque in which she was sheltering with her family. She woke in hospital to discover that her two-year-old brother Hisham and many other family members were dead. She lists the names of those killed in a voice that seems detached from the immense loss she has experienced. It is the voice of a child still in shock at the loss of her grandparents, Hashim, Issam and Ni'ma, her aunt Reem, and her cousins Sireen, Riham and Asma. Sireen was pregnant and had a young daughter. That child was also among the dead. Rama survived with severe wounds to her left hand and right leg, but the hospital does not have the facilities to treat her injuries properly. If she is not evacuated from Gaza, she says, both limbs will be amputated. ""Running and drawing were once my best hobbies,"" Rama says, ""but without the proper treatment, I won't be able to enjoy them again… I dream of a life like other children around the world, where I can again run and draw."" Near to where Rama lies, there is another girl - about 10 years old - who lies strapped into a medical brace. She appears to have suffered a serious back injury. Somebody has given the child some Barbie dolls to play with and a plastic tiara to wear. They are symbols of a vanished normality in a place of the dead and maimed. She picks up a doll with red hair and caresses it gently. A small child's screaming erupts from another ward. Adult voices can be heard trying to console him. The girl with the doll does not react, as if she is trying to close herself into a world that war cannot reach. Outside the hospital, the soundscape of Gaza is dominated by the rumble of jets, the constant whine of the military drones and the explosions when they find their target. For 24-year-old Tala Abu Nahel, who lives in Rafah in a house shared with nine other families, there is a belief that survival is a matter of luck. We first interviewed Tala more than a month ago, when she tried to escape Gaza with her severely disabled brother, Yazid, aged 17. They were turned back as they did not have foreign passports. Yazid suffers chronic seizures, made much worse now by the absence of medication. Tala explains the psychological torment of living under constant threat of attack. ""Every time I hear like a rocket or bomb that's going to drop on people… it's horrible to say this, but sort of it gives me this, this sort of relief, that it's not us,"" she says. ""But that does not mean that we're fully safe. It's like every day it feels like we're next. And it feels like we're just getting by on luck. I don't think I have any more hope."" Sitting in his wheelchair in the garden of the house in Rafah, Yazid glances repeatedly upwards in the direction of the drones. Tala strokes her brother's hand to comfort him. ""It's been over 70 days, with nothing changing. It keeps getting worse,"" she says. ""I think what I fear the most is that I don't want to be a number. I just don't want to die or get killed to be another one of those 20,000 people who got killed."" The people of Gaza grieve their dead and live in fear of dying themselves. They flee from one unsafe place to another. They endure this because they have no choice. Every border is closed to them. Each day, the funerals of their dead bring forth corpses of all ages, wrapped in white shrouds or in plastic body bags. At the Nasser Medical Complex, a boy prostrates himself on the body of his father lying among a group of corpses. He spreads his arms to hug the dead man, his fingers grasping the plastic sheeting. ""Our dad,"" he sobs, ""I can't take it any more."" An older male relative reaches in to stroke his arm. But the child is beyond consolation. Eventually he is gently drawn away from his father. The men begin to lift the corpses, one holding each end of the body bag. They move through the gates where they stop and pray for the dead. Barring a sudden declaration of ceasefire, the same rituals of mourning will be repeated tomorrow by different families in the same small place.",2023-12-20T17:09:10.000Z

Talks on new pause in Gaza war gain urgency as Hamas chief visits CairoPublished20 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"While a full ceasefire in the Gaza Strip still looks a long way off, there are fresh signs that a new pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas could be possible. However, that would require a shift in Hamas's public position. It has consistently said that it will only free more Israeli hostages in exchange for a permanent ceasefire. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who usually lives in Doha, has now travelled to Cairo along with a ""high level"" delegation for talks with Egypt's intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel. That indicates a level of seriousness. Both Egypt and Qatar play key roles in mediation efforts and helped secure a week-long truce late last month. Israel maintains that the war in Gaza will only end when its goal of dismantling Hamas - which has governed there since 2007 - has been achieved. According to mainstream Israeli media reports, Israel has presented a plan to mediators which could secure the release of some 30 to 40 hostages. This prioritises the remaining women, as well as men who are elderly or in need of urgent medical care. It is thought that they could be exchanged for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons who have been convicted of more serious offences than the women and teenagers released in the previous deal, and that a truce could last for a week or two. The Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, told foreign diplomats on Tuesday that his country was ready for ""another humanitarian pause, and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages"". Later, after meeting a select group of families with loved ones held in captivity in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that ""retrieving them is a top goal"". He confirmed that the head of Israel's Mossad spy agency had been twice to Europe in recent days to promote a new release deal. On Monday, in Poland, he and his US counterpart met the Qatari prime minister. Israeli leaders have continued to assert that only strong military pressure on Hamas will bring it to the negotiating table. However, the families of the remaining hostages have openly expressed scepticism about that. Their anxiety has risen sinceFriday's accidental killing by Israeli forces of three hostages. In recent days, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a smaller armed faction, have put out two videos showing a total of five men still held captive, pleading to be brought home. All appear thin and the speakers say they fear becoming victims of Israel's bombardment. Next week, the head of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, is also due to travel to Cairo with other senior officials from his group. It is believed that more than 100 hostages remain alive in Gaza, after 105 civilians were released from captivity in late November, most of them Israeli women and children. Four hostages had been released prior to that and one had been rescued by Israeli troops. A number of bodies have also been recovered and the Israeli prime minister's office has confirmed the deaths of more than 20 people who had been held by Hamas. At a global level, there are growing calls for a complete ceasefire, including at the UN General Assembly. With the death toll now close to 20,000 in Gaza, according to local health officials in the Hamas-run territory, the UN estimates that 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have fled or lost their homes. There is growing concern about the limited scope for aid agencies to help them. ""Amid displacement at an unimaginable scale and active hostilities, the humanitarian response system is on the brink,"" Tor Wennesland, the UN's Special Co-ordinator for the Middle East Peace Process told the Security Council on Tuesday. While UN officials say much more needs to be done, a new pause in fighting could at least allow a boost in aid delivery and distribution.",2023-12-20T13:28:19.000Z

Israel Gaza: Negotiations delay UN vote urging pause in fightingPublished20 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Last-minute negotiations have delayed a UN vote on a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Wrangles over the wording of the Security Council resolution, reportedly to avoid another veto by the US, mean the vote has moved to Wednesday. Increased pressure for a suspension of fighting between Israel and Hamas comes as the leader of Hamas is expected to travel to Egypt for talks. Ismail Haniyeh is due in Cairo later on Wednesday, a source told the BBC. Egypt, alongside Qatar, helped broker a truce last month that led to a week-long ceasefire and the release of some 100 hostages captured by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians being held in Israeli jails. Israeli leaders have rejected a new ceasefire since then, saying it would only benefit Hamas. But on Tuesday Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the country was ready for another pause in the fighting to enable more hostages to be released. Hamas official Osama Hamdan told a news conference in Beirut on Monday that the group was ""open to any initiative aiming for a ceasefire"", but he insisted there would be ""no negotiations on a hostage swap deal until the Zionist [Israeli] aggression completely stops"". The original draft Security Council resolution proposed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called for an ""urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities"" to allow ""safe and unhindered humanitarian access"". Initially diplomats thought they were very close to an agreement, 99% of the way there, but the final discussions have been complex, according to the UAE. The US says it is engaging constructively with other members to resolve outstanding issues. Late on Tuesday, the US Deputy Ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, was asked by the BBC whether the US supported the draft resolution and he said: ""We're still working on the text with other players and I don't want to get ahead of where we are at this point. So let's just see how the discussions go this afternoon."" Diplomats say the main sticking points are how to frame calls for a cessation of hostilities and the proposal for a UN mechanism to inspect aid going into Gaza. The US, along with Israel, opposes a ceasefire because they say it would benefit Hamas. Washington vetoed a previous Security Council resolution demanding one. The UK abstained, but every other member supported it. And Israel, according to one Security Council diplomat, is pressuring the US to veto this resolution as well, out of fear that a UN mechanism to monitor aid would prevent them from controlling deliveries in Gaza. When US state department spokesperson Matt Miller was asked whether Israel had asked the US to veto it, he said they had been in discussions with their ally, as well as other countries in the region, and they would ultimately make their own determination about what the best course of action was depending on what the final resolution stated. The current draft has already been watered down and now calls for a suspension of hostilities, rather than a sustainable cessation of hostilities, but it still includes a phrase calling for ""urgent steps"" towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities. The UAE's Ambassador to the UN, Lana Nusseibeh, said the priority and focus of the resolution were to have a real impact on the ground with a scaling-up of access, the opening of all land, sea and air crossing points, and ensuring Egypt has the support it needed from the UN in the form of a mechanism to streamline the process of monitoring aid. But overriding all of that, she said, was ensuring that humanitarian workers could deliver aid safely and were protected by the normal rules of de-confliction. But the Israeli government is under growing international pressure to agree to a ceasefire because of the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza. It is also facing pressure at home for a deal that would see more hostages freed, after Israeli soldiers mistakenly killed three Israeli men who had been held captive in Gaza last week. Gaza has been devastated by the war, which was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 taken hostage. Since then, more than 19,600 people have been killed in Gaza, about 70% of them women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. It reported that about 100 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli air strikes on Tuesday. Ahead of the Security Council meeting, UN aid workers in Geneva could not hide their despair at the failure of the international community to put an end to the conflict and tackle the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Unicef spokesman James Elder, who recently returned from the territory, told reporters that ""every single child is enduring these 10 weeks of hell and not one of them can escape"". He lamented that ""not even lip service"" had been paid to requirements, under international law, to safeguard medical facilities, food and water. Only eight of Gaza's 36 hospitals are still partially functioning, according to the World Health Organization. They are overwhelmed by casualties and facing critical shortages of medical supplies and fuel for generators, as well as providing shelter for thousands of displaced people. WHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris said her colleagues in Gaza had run out of ""words to describe the horror"" they were witnessing. They were not even able to walk through emergency wards at ""for fear of stepping on people"" lying on the floor ""in severe pain"" and asking for food and water, she added.",2023-12-20T01:28:20.000Z

BP pauses all Red Sea shipments after rebel attacksPublished18 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Oil giant BP will pause all shipments of oil through the Red Sea after recent attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels. The firm blamed the ""deteriorating security situation"" in the region as Iran-backed Houthis target ships they believe are bound for Israel. Many freight firms have suspended journeys as the attacks continue. Following BP's announcement the US said it would lead an international naval operation to protect ships along the route. Countries joining the security group include the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain. In a statement, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said: ""The recent escalation in reckless Houthi attacks originating from Yemen threatens the free flow of commerce, endangers innocent mariners, and violates international law."" BP said it would keep its ""precautionary pause under ongoing review"" and monitor the region. Analysts suggested that if other large oil firms follow suit, oil prices could rise. Oil prices were higher on Monday, with international benchmark Brent trading up 2.6% to almost $79 a barrel. ""Right now it's unclear how significant the impact will be,"" said Gregory Brew, an oil historian and analyst at Eurasia Group. ""Though if more shipping companies divert their traffic, and if the disruption lasts more than a week or two, prices are likely to climb further."" The Red Sea is one of the world's most important routes for oil and liquefied natural gas shipments, as well as for consumer goods. Analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence found that nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa were shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil. ""Consumer goods will face the largest impact, though current disruptions are occurring during the off-peak shipping season,"" said Chris Rogers from S&P Global Market Intelligence. On Monday, one of the world's largest shipping firms said it would no longer carry Israeli cargo via the Red Sea. In an update seen by the BBC, Evergreen Line, said: ""For the safety of ships and crew, Evergreen Line has decided to temporarily stop accepting Israeli cargo with immediate effect, and has instructed its container ships to suspend navigation through the Red Sea until further notice."" The Houthi rebels are targeting ships travelling through the Bab al-Mandab Strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - which is a channel 20 miles (32km) wide, and known for being perilous to navigate. The rebels have declared their support for Hamas and have said they are targeting ships travelling to Israel, using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels. Instead of using the Bab al-Mandab Strait, ships will now have to take a longer route navigating around southern Africa, potentially adding about 10 days to the journey and costing millions of dollars. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza following the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,200 people. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 18,700 have been killed since the start of the war. It is not clear if all the ships Houthi rebels have attacked were actually heading to Israel. In the most recent reported assault, the owner of the MT Swan Atlantic said the ship was hit by an ""unidentified object"" on Monday while in the Red Sea off Yemen despite there being no links to Israel. Inventor Chemical Tankers said: ""For the record, there is no Israeli link in the ownership (Norwegian), technical management (Singapore) of the vessel nor in any parts of the logistical chain for the cargo transported."" Attacks on ships have intensified in recent days, leading to shipping firms suspending travel through the strait which sits between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast. It is the route by which ships can reach the Suez Canal from the south - itself a major shipping lane. Maersk, the world's second-biggest shipping firm, described the situation as ""alarming"" on Friday after a ""near-miss"" incident involving Maersk Gibraltar and another attack on a container ship. It was followed by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), the world's largest shipping group, which said it would also divert its ships from the area. Its container ship, MSC PALATIUM III, was attacked on Friday as it was transiting the Red Sea. There were no injuries to the crew, but the ship has been taken out of service. CMA-CGM has also stopped shipments through the region, and Reuters has reported that Belgian oil tanker firm Euronav and Norway-based tanker group Frontline would both avoid Red Sea routes. On Monday, Inventor Chemical Tankers confirmed that the MT Swan Atlantic was targeted while travelling from France to Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The company said there were no injuries to its Indian crew, adding that the ""crew and the ship are now assisted by the US navy and will be brought to safety under protection by naval forces"". Germany's Hapag-Lloyd said it was re-routing several ships via the Cape of Good Hope, until passage through the Red Sea ""will be safe again for vessels and their crews"". Evergreen Line said that any container ships on longer journeys between Asia and the Mediterranean, Europe or the east coast of the US would also be diverted around the Cape of Good Hope. Peter Sand, chief analyst at freight rate data company Xeneta, said shipping firms would now be contacting customers to let them know that cargo was being delayed, adding that there was ""definitely a price to pay for a situation like this"". He said the industry would also face knock-on effects such as higher insurance premiums, but he said that it was in a much better position to deal with an unfolding crisis than it was when the hugeEver Given ship blocked the Suez Canal in 2021, with Covid-related supply chain issues having eased up. Sue Terpilowski of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport also pointed out that in addition to extra fuel costs and time, the war-risk insurance costs are going up ""exponentially"", with customers facing higher prices being passed on to them too.

"We've talked to Israel about making Gaza war more 'surgical', US saysPublished18 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has said he urged Israel to protect civilians in Gaza and make the war there more ""surgical"". Mr Austin, who spoke after a meeting with his Israeli counterpart in Tel Aviv, reiterated US support for the offensive against Hamas. He said Washington would provide more arms, vehicles and munitions to Israel. US officials have been steadfast in their support of Israel since the 7 October attacks by Hamas. But President Joe Biden has been under growing pressure, including from within his own Democratic Party, to rein in their military campaign. Speaking on Monday, Mr Austin said the US would not ""dictate timelines or terms"" of the war to its ally. ""Our support to Israel's right to defend itself is ironclad... and that's not going to change,"" he said. ""It's critical... that Hamas not be able to threaten Israel from Gaza or even threaten Gaza anymore."" Mr Austin then said he had discussed the objectives of the military campaign and ""how to reduce harm to civilians in the battlespace"" with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant ""We also have some great thoughts about how to transition from high intensity operations to a lower intensity and more surgical operations,"" he said. Mr Gallant, meanwhile, said Israeli forces would ""continue to operate in Gaza with different levels of intensity"". While Mr Austin has been advising Israel to temper and target its operations since its military campaign began, he has become more outspoken as civilian deaths have increased. He earlier warned that Israel risked replacing a tactical victory with a strategic defeat. The health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, says more than 19,400 people have been killed and 52,000 injured in the enclave since the start of the war. Mr Austin said that he had held discussions with Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, about how to reduce civilian casualties and collateral damage as the operation continues. His remarks align with the US government's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to ""put a premium on human life"" and give clearer instructions to allow people to avoid the conflict. Senior US officials have also displayed increasing discontent at Israel's military response. Last week, Mr Biden said Israel was starting to lose global support over what he called its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza. But he reiterated that Israel could rely on US support and stressed that he supported its right to defend itself. Concern has mounted over the rising civilian cost of Israeli military operations in the Hamas-run territory, which began after Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October left around 1,200 Israelis dead. A Human Rights Watch report released on Monday accused Israel of ""using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in the Gaza Strip, which is a war crime"".",2023-12-18T22:14:22.000Z

Israel-Gaza: The man held with the hostages Israel mistakenly killedPublished18 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"""Am I lucky or unlucky?"" Wichian Temthong pondered the question. ""I guess I'm lucky, because I'm still here, still alive."" The 37-year-old farm worker is one of 23 Thai hostages who were released by Hamas last month. Now Wichian is back in Thailand, living in a small room in an industrial suburb south of Bangkok with his wife Malai. While he survived, three young Israeli men he met in captivity did not. They were mistakenly shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Wichian had gone to Israel only in late September, driven like so many Thais from the poor north-east of the country to find better-paid work on Israeli farms. After nine days he was moved to an avocado orchard on the Kfar Aza kibbutz. He woke up on 7 October, his first morning there, to the sound of gunfire. His fellow Thai workers assured him it was normal. But as the shooting got louder towards midday, they decided to lock themselves in one of the buildings. Before they could do that gunmen burst in, one holding a hand grenade. They started beating the Thais with their rifle butts. ""I crouched down like this and shouted 'Thailand, Thailand, Thailand', he said, showing how he pulled his arms over his head. ""But they kept beating me. All I could do was keep my face down. One guy stamped on me with his feet. I crawled under the bed to hide. I tried to text my wife to say I was being taken, but they dragged me out by my leg."" Wichian was eventually taken down into tunnels deep under Gaza, and would be kept there for 51 days. His was a lonely ordeal, because he was the only Thai, and he speaks no English, so could only communicate through drawings and hand gestures. Conditions were grim. The hostages were fed just once a day; sometimes this was no more than a piece of bread and a dried date. ""When I was distressed they would come and talk to me, to calm me down, but I could not understand them. The only way I got by was by thinking of the faces of my children, my wife and my mother. ""When there was nothing else to do, I'd just sit against the wall and meditate. I kept thinking about the same thing over and over, which was that I had to survive."" He remembers the other hostages who were with him in the tunnels; three young Israeli men - Yotam, Sammy and Alon - who remained in captivity after his release, only to be shot dead by nervous Israeli soldiers as they came out, waving a white cloth, last Friday. He had just seen the news, with their photographs, when we arrived to interview him. ""Every day my foreign friends and I tried to support each other. We would shake hands and do fist bumps. They would cheer me up by hugging me and clapping my shoulder. But we could only communicate by using our hands."" He found out that Yotam was a drummer, and Sammy loved riding his motorbike, and worked in a chicken farm. Wichian tried to teach them some Thai words. Wichian said two of the Israelis were in the tunnel with him from day one. The third joined them on 9 October. He says he was treated leniently by his captors, but that in their first weeks underground two of the Israelis were sometimes beaten with electric cables. ""We were always hungry. We could only sip our water. A large bottle had to last four to five days, a smaller bottler for two days."" He really suffered from not being able to wash. They were allowed to sleep in the day, not at night. They were always damp - nothing dried in the tunnels. He kept himself busy by trying to clean their living area. He even helped the Hamas guards move rubble that came into the tunnel after it was struck by a bomb. After a month the four hostages were moved to a new tunnel. ""At around 7pm they brought us up. But as soon as I saw it, my heart wanted to run back down to the tunnel. ""You could see bright lights everywhere from the aerial fighting. I heard drones flying all over the place, and the sound of gunfire. We had to run for 20 minutes, trying to avoid the drones."" Wichian says his captors encouraged him to count the days on a calendar, and even brought him a clock, because he kept asking them the time. The end of his ordeal came suddenly. ""They came pointing to me and saying 'you, you go home, Thailand'."" He saw daylight for the first time in 51 days, and was handed over to the Red Cross and driven over the border to Egypt. ""All the time I was down there I never shed a tear. But once I came up, and saw the two other released Thais, I hugged them and cried. We had a group hug and sat down with tears filling our eyes, asking ourselves how we could have survived. ""When I got back to Thailand they gave me a new name. They called me 'the survivor' and 'Mr Plenty of Fortune'."" However, he still needs to pay back the substantial debt he incurred - around 230,000 Thai baht ($6,570; £5,180) - to cover the cost of his trip to Israel. He never had the chance to earn any money there. So, like his wife, Wichian is taking a job in a factory. The salary is low - just 800 baht a day. They cannot save much. Their two children are living with their grandparents in their home province of Buri Ram. Wichian sometimes has trouble sleeping, and wakes up calling for his mother. But, he says, he would go back to Israel, just for the chance to earn, and save, a little more.",2023-12-18T22:13:13.000Z

Israel Gaza: Hamas releases video showing three elderly Israeli hostagesPublished18 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The armed wing of Hamas, the al-Qassam Brigades, has released a video of three elderly Israeli men being held hostage in the Gaza Strip. The video shows Chaim Peri, 79, Yoram Metzger, 80, and Amiram Cooper, 85. Mr Peri can be seen addressing the camera and calling for their release. About 120 hostages are believed to still be in captivity in Gaza after a deadly Hamas attack on 7 October. Israel's military described the footage as a ""criminal terror video"". ""It testifies to Hamas' cruelty towards innocent, very elderly civilians who are in need of medical care,"" said Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). ""The world must act in order to deliver medical aid and check on the state of the hostages. We are morally obliged to make every and all efforts in order to bring the hostages back home,"" the spokesman added. The footage was released on the Telegram messaging app. The hostages taken in October are believed to be held by Hamas and allied Palestinian groups. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law and so the BBC does not broadcast the full details of material which may have been filmed under duress. A spokesperson for Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the men were abducted from, urged US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is currently visiting Israel, to secure their release. ""We appreciate any sign of life from the hostages, but time is running out,"" the spokesperson said. ""The immediate release of all those abducted, through any potential negotiation avenue, is urgently required. ""Each passing day exacerbates their situation. Recent events sadly illustrate that the hostages' situation is deteriorating with each passing day, particularly for older individuals."" An estimated 240 hostages were taken to Gaza during Hamas's 7 October attacks that killed about 1,200 in southern Israel. Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation it says is aimed at destroying Hamas. More than 18,000 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, with hundreds of thousands displaced. During a six-day ceasefire at the end of November, 105 hostages were released in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. On Friday, three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza were shot dead while holding a white cloth, an Israeli military official said. The hostages - Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 - were killed in the Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City. According to an Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the men emerged shirtless from a building, with one carrying a stick with a white cloth. One of the soldiers, the official added, felt threatened, as the men were at a distance of tens of metres, declared them ""terrorists"" and opened fire. Two were immediately killed while the third, wounded, returned to the building. A cry for help was heard in Hebrew and the battalion commander ordered the troops to cease fire. The wounded hostage later re-emerged, and was shot and killed, the official said. It is not clear if the hostages had been abandoned by their captors or escaped. An IDF official said the case was ""against our rules of engagement"" and an investigation was happening at the ""highest level"". Families of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to reach a new truce for at least some of the captives to be freed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has deflected the calls, insisting ""military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory"". Speaking to reporters on Monday, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby addressed rumours of a possible new hostage deal, and said talks were not at a point where an agreement was imminent.",2023-12-18T22:04:48.000Z

"Israel has gone beyond self-defence in Gaza, Tory MP Alicia Kearns saysPublished18 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Israel has ""gone beyond self-defence"" and lost the moral authority in its war with Hamas, the chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee has said. Tory MP Alicia Kearns told the BBC she thinks Israel has broken international law and risks increasing support for Hamas among Palestinians. She said: ""Bombs don't obliterate an ideology and neither can a stable state be constructed from oblivion."" Former Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has also criticised Israel's tactics. Writing in theDaily Telegraph, he said Israel's legal basis for military action in Gaza was ""being undermined"" and warned its government was ""making the mistake of losing its moral authority alongside its legal one"". Asked if she agreed with Mr Wallace that Israel has damaged its standing with its conduct in Gaza, Ms Kearns told BBC Radio 4's World At One: ""I think unfortunately it has. ""International humanitarian law in my view has been broken."" She said a truce that could be turned into a lasting ceasefire should be pursued, rather than a focus on the eradication of Hamas - which Israel, the UK, US and some other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation. Ten Tory MPs - including former Cabinet ministers Kit Malthouse and George Eustice - havewritten to the Foreign Secretary Lord Cameronurging him to push for an ""immediate ceasefire"", describing Israel's strategy as ""neither proportionate nor targeted"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted operations, which were launched when Hamas carried out an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, will continue until the group is dismantled. Around 1,200 people were killed and an estimated 240 people were taken hostage by Hamas - and despite some being returned during a temporary truce, about 120 are still thought to be inside Gaza. Ms Kearns - who chairs the committee of MPs tasked with holding the Foreign Office to account - warned Israel could inadvertently increase support for Hamas among Palestinians. She said: ""Hamas is an ideology which recruits into its membership."" An opinion poll carried out between 22 November and 2 December by a respected Palestinian think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, found that support for Hamas had more than tripled in the occupied West Bank compared to three months ago. Supporters of Hamas were still in a minority, but 70% of the respondents said armed struggle was the best means of ending the Israeli occupation. Israel has come under growing international pressure over the scale of civilian casualties in Gaza, which Hamas-controlled authorities put at more than 19,400. The same authorities claimed 110 people were killed on Sunday in Israeli air strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp, which had been the largest settlement for displaced people prior to the current fighting. The retaliatory Israeli offensive has seen much of northern Gaza damaged and 85% of the territory's 2.3 million population driven from their homes. On Sunday, Lord Cameron signalled a shift in tone from the governmentby calling for a ""sustainable ceasefire""- echoing a form of words Prime Minister Rishi Sunak used in the Commons last week. Writing in the Sunday Times, the foreign secretary said: ""Our goal cannot simply be an end to fighting today. It must be peace lasting for days, years, generations."" Speaking to reporters during a visit to Scotland on Monday, Mr Sunak called for Israel to respect humanitarian law, adding: ""It's clear that too many civilian lives have been lost and nobody wants to see this conflict go on a day longer than it has to."" The government has consistently stopped short of calling for a full ceasefire, saying it respects Israel's right to self-defence. Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy pushed back against Mr Wallace's criticism, describing his choice of words as ""unfortunate language"". He told the BBC said allowing Hamas to ""literally get away with murder"" would be more likely to radicalise people than Israel's military tactics. However, Husam Zomlot, the head of the Palestinian mission to the UK, accused the Israeli army of normalising ""the mass murder of children, [and] women"" and ""the mass destruction of hospitals, schools, churches, mosques"".",2023-12-18T20:42:10.000Z

Gaza health ministry says Israeli strikes kill 110 in JabaliaPublished18 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"At least 110 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes in northern Gaza's Jabalia area, the Hamas-run health ministry says, as fighting continues across the Palestinian territory. Fifty people were reportedly killed and dozens trapped under rubble when three homes in Jabalia refugee camp were hit. Videos showed the bodies of small children lined up at a medical centre. The Israeli military said it had been conducting operations against Hamas ""terrorist infrastructure"" in Jabalia. It came as the US defence secretary arrived in Tel Aviv for talks with Israeli leaders that were expected to focus on how to lower the intensity of the fighting to protect civilians. The UN Security Council was also expected to vote later on a resolution calling for an ""urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities"", amid reports of discussions on a potential new deal to secure the release of more Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Gaza has been devastated by 10 weeks of war triggered by an unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and about 240 taken hostage. Since then, more than 19,400 people have been killed in Gaza, about 70% of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Witnesses and local journalists said Israeli missiles struck a block of houses in Jabalia refugee camp where three families had been living on Sunday night. On Monday morning, Palestinian media cited the Hamas-run health ministry's director general as saying that at least 50 people had been killed when the homes of the al-Bursh and Alwan families were bombed. He added that it brought to 110 the death toll in the wider Jabalia area since Sunday. Local journalists also posted videos on social media showing what they said were the bodies of nine children on the floor of the Jabalia Medical Centre. One identified the children as members of the al-Bursh and Suleiman families. Another 20 to 30 people were reportedly trapped beneath the rubble of the destroyed homes. BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, says verifying reports from the north is very difficult because of communication and access problems. But, he adds, Jabalia refugee camp has been a focus of Israeli ground operations over the past few weeks. And air strikes have intensified since Israeli tanks reportedly pulled out of the camp two days ago. When asked about the Jabalia strikes by AFP news agency, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stressed that it went to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. ""When planning a target, the IDF devotes significant time and resources to preparing the attack and where feasible, uses various tools, including advance warnings, roof knocking, street knocking, target clearing operations and a variety of professional calculations,"" it said. The IDF separately announced that its troops had been conducting operations in Jabalia and that they had uncovered cash worth almost $1.4m (£1.1m) in suitcases alongside weapons in the home of a senior Hamas figure. Gaza's health ministry also said that a 13-year-old girl was killed when an Israeli tank shell hit the maternity building of Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis on Sunday night. The girl, Dunia Abu Mohsen, had been receiving treatment after losing a leg in a previous strike in al-Amal that killed her parents, brother and sister. Another eight people, including journalist Haneen al-Qashtan, were reportedly killed in a strike in Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin was expected to tell Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and war cabinet in their meetings on Monday that Israel had to move away from its major combat operations to a more limited conflict targeting Hamas while shielding civilians. At a news conference with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, Mr Austin said protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza was ""both a moral duty and a strategic imperative"". Asked about a transition to lower intensity warfare, he stressed: ""This is Israel's operation, and I'm not here to dictate timelines or terms."" The UK, Germany and France added to the growing global pressure for a ceasefire over the weekend, saying that too many civilians had been killed. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell echoed those comments on Monday, saying: ""We are witnessing an appalling lack of distinction in Israel's military operation in Gaza."" In Israel, there are calls for any pause in the fighting to be linked to a new hostage release deal, after last week's mistaken killing by Israeli forces of three men who had been held captive in Gaza. In another development on Monday, Human Rights Watch accused Israel's military of ""using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare"". ""Israeli forces are deliberately blocking the delivery of water, food and fuel, while wilfully impeding humanitarian assistance, apparently razing agricultural areas, and depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to their survival,"" it alleged. Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy called the report ""a lie"". ""Israel has excess capacity to inspect more than twice as many aid trucks as are entering Gaza. We're still pumping water into Gaza through two pipelines and have placed no restrictions on entry of food and water. Direct your anger to Hamas, which hijacks aid,"" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.",2023-12-18T17:04:33.000Z

"Gazans trapped in church fear being shot, says relativePublished18 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Civilians trapped in a church in Gaza City are living in an ""unreal"" sense of fear, a relative of one of those confined there has said. Fifi Saba, whose sister is trapped inside the Holy Family Church, said people were scared to move out of fear of being shot. A mother and her daughter were killed inside the church by sniper fire on Saturday, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said. Pope Francis condemned the attack. ""A mother, Mrs Nahida Khalil Anton, and her daughter, Samar Kamal Anton, were killed, and others were wounded by the shooters while they were going to the bathroom,"" he said on Sunday. ""Some say, 'This is terrorism. This is war.' Yes, it is war. It is terrorism,"" he added. Ms Saba, a Catholic from Gaza who now lives in the US, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she was worried about her sister, her brother-in-law and their two children aged 9 and 12, who were trapped there. She said she was receiving news about them through a family member, who was able to speak to her sister once a day. ""They are locked in,"" she said. ""They can't really see the street very much, and most of the time they're cut off from the world. They don't have their phones, they don't have internet, they don't have the news."" She said her sister often asked for news about what was happening outside, and was able to hear bombs overhead. ""The fear they have been living is unreal,"" she said. Ms Saba said she received a message in which her sister said the ""situation is really difficult"". ""I found out later that day that when she said the situation is very difficult, she was witnessing the killing of the two people - the two women in the church,"" Ms Saba said. Ms Saba added that the family had spent ""a couple of hours"" hiding on the ground in the church compound, because ""they believed the Israelis were shooting anything that moves"". ""They were terrified to go to the bathroom, because the women were shot trying to get to the toilet,"" she said, adding that the water to the church had been cut off for a few days. Food was also scarce, she said, with those trapped living off boiled spaghetti for three weeks. ""And I think the past couple of days they have had no food,"" she said. On Saturday, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women - named as Nahida and her daughter Samar - were shot and killed while walking to a building in the church complex known as the Sister's Convent. ""One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety,"" a statement said. Seven more people were shot and wounded as they ""tried to protect others inside the church compound"" on Saturday. The patriarchate said no warning had been given and added: ""They were shot in cold blood inside the premises of the parish, where there are no belligerents."" The patriarchate said that earlier on Saturday an Israeli tank fired on part of the church compound with 54 disabled people inside. It caused a fire that destroyed the building's generator, the only source of electricity, and some of the disabled people can no longer use their respirators,the statement said. In response to the church's letter, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said it took ""claims regarding harm to sensitive sites with the utmost seriousness"". It said an incident with its troops took place near a church in the Shejaiya area, and that an ""initial review suggests that IDF troops"" were operating against a Hamas ""threat that they identified in the area of the church"". ""The IDF is conducting a thorough review of the incident,"" it said. The BBC has contacted the IDF for further comment on the accusations of indiscriminate shooting. It is unclear why the church is allegedly being targeted, but Ms Saba said she did not believe Hamas fighters were inside, and that her sister had not mentioned their presence. ""We've seen in the past 72 days how hospitals are attacked, schools are attacked, libraries are attacked, markets are attacked, bakeries are attacked. ""I find it hard to believe if that's the narrative they're using,"" she said. Layla Moran, a UK member of parliament, also told the BBC thatmembers of her extended family, who are Christian Palestinians, were trapped in the church, having sought refuge after their home was bombed in the first week of the war. ""I'm now no longer sure they are going to survive until Christmas,"" she said, adding that they no longer had access to food or water. The family members said soldiers had entered the church compound in the last 24 hours and had taken over a room in a building. The family has sent a photo, seen by the BBC, of two bodies lying in a street outside the church building. Ms Moran's relatives say the bodies have been decaying for days. Ms Moran said there had been no explanation as to why Israeli soldiers might target the church and no warnings or leaflets were sent to people sheltering there. ""It does feel like it's making a mockery of keeping civilians safe,"" she said. Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group in its 7 October attacks. The Israeli military has repeatedly said it does not target civilians. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 18,700 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave since the start of the war.",2023-12-18T16:50:58.000Z

Israel Gaza: Hostages shot by IDF put out 'SOS' sign written with leftover foodPublished18 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by soldiers in Gaza on Friday had used leftover food to write signs pleading for help, Israel says. The men had been staying at the building next to where they were shot ""for some period of time"", according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The head of the IDF told troops that they are ""absolutely not"" permitted to shoot those surrendering. ""The IDF doesn't shoot a person who raises their hands,"" said Herzi Halevi. He said Gazans with a white flag must be arrested and not shot ""if they lay down their arms and raise their hands"". About 120 hostages are believed to be still in captivity in the Gaza Strip, held by Hamas and allied Palestinian groups. Israel is under increasing pressure for a deal to free more hostages. Israeli officials have admitted that killing the three men who were holding a white flag was a breach of ""rules of engagement"". They were seized and taken to Gaza during the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed around 1,200 in southern Israel. Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation it says is aimed at destroying Hamas. More than 18,000 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the local health authorities, with hundreds of thousands of others pushed out of their homes. The Israeli hostages - Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 - were killed in the Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday as Israeli troops face stiff resistance. According to an Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the men emerged shirtless from a building, with one carrying a stick with a white cloth. One of the soldiers, the official added, felt threatened, as the men were at a distance of tens of metres, declared them ""terrorists"" and opened fire. Two were immediately killed while the third, wounded, returned to the building. A cry for help was heard in Hebrew and the battalion commander ordered the troops to cease fire. The wounded hostage later re-emerged, and was shot and killed, the official said. It is not clear if the hostages had been abandoned by their captors or escaped. On Sunday, the IDF said a search of the building was carried out, revealing the messages ""SOS"" and ""Help, 3 hostages"" written on fabric. Officials believe the hostages had been there for some time. Since the end of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier this month, families of the hostages have urged the Israeli government to reach a new truce for at least some of the captives to be freed. The initial deal led to the release of more than 100 hostages, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has deflected the calls, insisting ""military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory"". Amid mounting Palestinian civilian casualties, Israeli authorities have come under growing international pressure, including from the country's main ally, the US. On Sunday, France's Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna went to Israel calling for an ""immediate and durable truce"". Her Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen said a ceasefire would be an error, describing it as a gift to Hamas. The UK and Germany have also called for a ""sustainable ceasefire"", whilst stopping short of saying it should be immediate. Vast areas of the Gaza Strip have been destroyed by the Israeli bombardment, and the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe amid widespread shortages of basic supplies. Images on social media on Sunday showed Gaza residents climbing on aid lorries. With no let-up in the fighting, the IDF published images of what it said was Hamas's largest attack tunnel so far. The tunnel - in some places wide enough for cars to pass through - was some 400m from the Erez border crossing with Israel, the IDF said.",2023-12-18T14:34:30.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: Man on hunger strike hospitalised calling for ceasefirePublished18 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A man originally from Gaza has been hospitalised after being on hunger strike for nearly two months over the Israel-Gaza war. Wael Arafat, 28, moved from Deir Al Balah to Bristol when he was young and is calling for a ceasefire. His mother, Patricia Davis-Thomas, said he is ""very unwell"" and that he has 17 family members who have been killed. She explained that seven days after he started the hunger strike, they had to call for an ambulance. Israel says that for the first time since the fighting began in October,aid has entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing. Until now there have only been limited deliveries through the Rafah Crossing with Egypt. An increasing number of countries arecalling for a ceasefire.in the Israel-Gaza war. Mr Arafat from Bristol has been refusing food at the Royal United Hospital in Bath. Speaking to BBC Arabic, Mr Arafat said: ""I probably have a week or two before I die. ""I want the world to do something and not for me, but I want the world to do something for the people of Gaza, for the children, the elderly and the youth."" Ms Davis-Thomas said: ""He came to this country to be safe. ""He's been traumatised, but he's always had a very strong link to Palestine, even though he left there when he was very young. ""He expresses his distress around the children that are being harmed. He remembers himself as a child living in Palestine, under occupation."" Mr Arafat told the BBC he did not want to stop the hunger strike until, ""they hear us and know that we are not animals, we are humans and when I see the ceasefire in Gaza."" Ms Davis-Thomas added: ""I took in a young lad of 14. I brought him up in the way he should have been brought up, in the way that his family would have wanted him to be brought up."" ""So I learnt about his culture. I knew nothing about Palestine before he came to me. I helped him in his education. I got him to this point."" ""Now I just feel I'm going to lose my son and nobody has a right to die like that. I'm trying to save my son here."" She said she wanted people to think about those in Palestine running for their and their children's lives. Ms David-Thomas said he is ""critical"" in hospital and has managed to encourage him to have a little fluid. She added: ""I tell him every day in hospital - you have a right to protest. We all have a right to protest. But you don't have to take it to the point where you have to die."" ""He wants to be heard, he doesn't want to die. He's expressed that to the doctors and they are trying to do their best by him. ""But if he doesn't take fluids, if he isn't encouraged to start to eat, then he will die."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the Israeli government is still trying to complete the recovery of all the hostages held in Gaza, saying military pressure on Hamas was needed to secure their release. Mr Netanyahu has indicated that talks are happening, and there are reports which suggest both Egypt and Qatar are involved in the discussions.

UK MP Layla Moran's family among hundreds trapped in Gaza churchPublished17 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"UK MP Layla Moran says her relatives are among hundreds of civilians trapped in a Catholic Church in Gaza City as Israeli forces operate nearby. The Liberal Democrat says her family are ""days away from dying"" without access to water or food. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem say a mother and daughter were killed inside the Holy Family Church complex on Saturday by sniper fire. The IDF said it found no evidence to show the incident took place. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said: ""During the dialogue between the IDF and representatives of the community, no reports of a hit on the church, nor civilians being injured or killed, were raised. ""A review of the IDF's operational findings support this."" The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women - named as Nahida and her daughter Samar - were shot and killed while walking to a building in the church complex known as the Sister's Convent. ""One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety,"" a statement said. Seven more people were shot and wounded as they ""tried to protect others inside the church compound"" on Saturday. The patriarchate said no warning had been given and added: ""They were shot in cold blood inside the premises of the parish, where there are no belligerents."" The patriarchate said that earlier on Saturday an Israeli tank fired on part of the church compound with 54 disabled people inside. It caused a fire that destroyed the building's generator, the only source of electricity, and some of the disabled people can no longer use their respirators,the statement said. Members of Ms Moran's extended family - a grandmother, her son, his wife and their 11-year-old twins - are Christian Palestinians who sought refuge inside the church after their home was bombed in the first week of the war. They have been staying on mattresses along with dozens of others in rooms in the Holy Family Church for more than 60 days. ""I'm now no longer sure they are going to survive until Christmas,"" Ms Moran told the BBC. They have been keeping in touch with Ms Moran and other family members sporadically through WhatsApp messages and calls - though they have no internet and power is intermittent. A sixth member of the family - a grandfather -died last month after not being able to get to hospital to receive medical treatment, Ms Moran says. The five remaining members say they now no longer have access to food or water, and the last remaining generator - which was pumping water from wherever they could get it - has stopped working in the church. They say soldiers entered the church compound in the last 24 hours and took over a room in a building. Earlier in the week, the family heard shots being fired and saw bullet casings in the church compound. They say two men were killed on Tuesday while they were coming and going from the building - a bin collector and a janitor. The family have sent a photo, seen by the BBC, of two bodies lying on a street outside the church building. Ms Moran's relatives say the bodies have been decaying outside for days. The BBC has not verified the circumstances of what the image shows. Ms Moran says there has been no explanation as to why Israeli soldiers would target the church and no warnings or leaflets were sent to people sheltering there. ""It does feel like it's making a mockery of keeping civilians safe,"" Ms Moran adds. Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group. Early on in the war Israel told people in northern Gaza to move to southern Gaza for their safety. It has also paused military activity in some areas for short periods to allow people to leave. There was also a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to allow a swap of some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. However Israel has also bombed southern Gaza, where it told people to go, and a large number of Palestinians have remained in Gaza City and other northern areas. Ms Moran says she has been in touch with a number of countries about getting her relatives out of Gaza, but the situation is ""incredibly complex"". She adds that the family have considered trying to travel to Rafah in southern Gaza near the border with Egypt but say it is too dangerous while no ceasefire is in place. Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during the brief truce. The health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, says more than 18,700 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave since the start of the Gaza war.",2023-12-17T18:42:02.000Z

Israel Gaza: Lord Cameron supports 'sustainable ceasefire' and warns over deathsPublished17 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The foreign secretary has said he would like to see a ""sustainable ceasefire"" in the Israel-Gaza conflict. Lord Cameron also warned ""too many civilians have been killed"" in Gaza. More than 18,000 people have been killed, including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. His interventionin a Sunday Times articlemarks a shift in tone from the UK government, but stops short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. Penning a joint article with Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Lord Cameron said he supported a ceasefire only if it was sustainable in the long term. He said: ""Our goal cannot simply be an end to fighting today. It must be peace lasting for days, years, generations. ""We therefore support a ceasefire, but only if it is sustainable."" Earlier this week theUK and Germany abstained over a United Nations resolution, backed by 153 countries, demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. On Sunday France, which was among the countries which voted for the resolution,called for an ""immediate and durable truce"" in the conflict, ahead of a meeting between the French and Israeli foreign ministers in Tel Aviv. Seeking to explain the UK's position, Lord Cameron wrote: ""We do not believe that calling right now for a general and immediate ceasefire, hoping it somehow becomes permanent, is the way forward."" He added: ""Would Hamas stop firing rockets? Would it release the hostages? Would its murderous ideology change? An unsustainable ceasefire, quickly collapsing into further violence, would only make it harder to build the confidence needed for peace."" Instead the UK and Germany are pushing for further humanitarian pauses to get more aid in and more hostages out. Lord Cameron's comments amplify Rishi Sunak's line set out at Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions. ""We have been consistent that what we support is a sustainable ceasefire, which means Hamas must stop launching rockets into Israel and release all the hostages,"" Mr Sunak said. Appearing on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said: ""In order for a ceasefire to be sustainable, we have to ensure we remove the threat of Hamas from Israel... ""So, that's why we continue to support Israel in its right to self-defence, to remove the threat of Hamas, and at the same time to get those hostages back."" Asked if he thought Israel had gone too far, Mr Dowden said: ""I wouldn't characterise it as Israel going too far. Israel is dealing with a very difficult situation."" He said the UK continued to urge Israel to exercise restraint but added: ""If you're going after an enemy that literally hides underneath hospitals, hides amongst the civilian population, you are going to sustain high levels of civilian casualties."" The offensive into Gaza,triggered by Hamas's deadly 7 October attackon Israel which killed 1,200 people, has led to vast areas of the territory being flattened. In a sign attitudes are shifting, in the article, the UK and German foreign ministers warned that Israel ""should do more to discriminate sufficiently between terrorists and civilians"". They also said more aid must reach Gaza, amid warnings from the United Nations of a humanitarian catastrophe due to widespread shortages of basic supplies. Israel's main ally the UShas also expressed uneaseover the failure of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration to reduce civilian casualties. Deflecting that pressure on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu said: ""Military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory. Without military pressure... we have nothing.""",2023-12-17T13:08:08.000Z

The UK and Germany earlier called for a ""sustainable ceasefire"", but stopped short of saying it should be immediate. Ms Colonna arrived in Tel Aviv on Sunday for a meeting with her Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen. A statement released by the French Foreign Ministry before her visit said she would call for a truce, which should ""lead to a lasting ceasefire with the aim of releasing all hostages and delivering aid to Gaza"". During the meeting with Mr Cohen, the French foreign minister added that the victims of the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October should not be forgotten. Mr Cohen repeated the Israeli government's position that there would be no ceasefire. But he said that France could play an important role in preventing the escalation of regional tensions. He added that while Israel ""has no intention to start another front"" on its northern border with Lebanon, it would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect Israeli citizens. Israel has been engaged in regular cross-border exchanges of fire with armed groups in southern Lebanon, most notably with the Iran-backed Hezbollah. Earlier on Sunday, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for a ""sustainable ceasefire"" in the conflict.

Catherine Colonna is also scheduled to meet the families of French hostages still being held by Hamas during her visit to Israel. Referring to allegations of sexual assault during the 7 October attacks, Ms Colonna said France ""believed the words of the victims"" and those who witnessed the alleged attacks. Earlier this week, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recovered the body of 28-year-old French-Israeli hostage Elya Toledano. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the Israeli government is still trying to complete the recovery of all the hostages held in Gaza, saying military pressure on Hamas was needed to secure their release.

On Friday, the IDFaccidentally killed three Israeli hostagesduring its operations in Gaza. Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 were shot at whilst holding a white cloth - the IDF said the incident was ""against our rules of engagement"" and that it was investigating the incident. There are still more than 120 people still being held in Gaza, and the accidental killing has added pressure on Israeli authorities to reach a deal for their release. France's Foreign Ministry has also demanded Israel explain an airstrike which killed one of its staff in Rafah this week.

Why US-Palestinian families are having 'the talk'Published17 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"After the shooting of three college students in New England and a string of other incidents, Palestinian Americans say they are worried about their safety. When Samer Elbandak heard that three young Palestinian men were shot over American Thanksgiving weekend in Burlington, Vermont, he immediately feared for his 16-year-old daughter. His daughter, who lives in Florida, is vocal about the plight of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. On her Instagram page, the Palestinian flag is prominently displayed. Embracing her identity is something that Mr Elbandak, a Palestinian-American Christian who was born and raised in Bethlehem and who immigrated to San Francisco 30 years ago, had always encouraged. But a week after the shooting of Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ali Ahmad - three 20-year-old Palestinian-American students - Mr Elbandak said he decided to fly to Florida to have a difficult conversation with his daughter. ""I explained to her that she needs to be very careful,"" he said. ""There are some people that are blind, that are full of hatred."" Palestinian parents in the US like Mr Elbandak say they are increasingly having their version of ""the talk"" - a conversation about encountering racism that has long been held in African-American and other minority households - after a recent string of incidents where people who are visibly Palestinian have been attacked. Police in Burlington said they are still investigating whether the 24 November shooting of the three men was a hate crime. The suspect, Jason Eaton, pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges. The victims of the attack maintain they were targeted because of their ethnicity. They were speaking a mix of Arabic and English at the time of the attack, and two of them were wearing keffiyehs - a traditional, Palestinian black-and-white scarf that often serves as a symbol of Palestinian identity and solidarity. Some say the incident has left them fearful that being visibly Palestinian in the US has become a risk since the Israel-Gaza war erupted on 7 October. Among those who felt this concern is Anne Bordonaro, a mother of two Palestinian college-aged men born and raised in Burlington. ""I looked at the picture of the three young men and I just felt a gut punch,"" Ms Bordonaro said. ""I said, those are my kids."" She then called her two boys and had a ""painful conversation"", in which she suggested they avoid wearing their keffiyehs in public. ""My younger son often wears one, it's just a symbol of identity, it is just part of who he is,"" Ms Bordonaro said, but she added she worried it made him a target. At the time of the Burlington shootings, the Palestinian community in the US - a small diaspora of around 220,000 - was already reeling from the murder on 14 October of a six-year-old Illinois boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume. Prosecutors have accused the suspect in Wadea's death of deliberately targeting the child and his mother for being Palestinian. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said it had received an ""unprecedented"" amount of reports of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias since 7 October, recording a total of 2,171 requests for help across the US as of December. The wife of a Harvard professor was caught on video harassing a student for wearing a keffiyeh, calling it a ""terrorist scarf"". On 7 November, a man wearing a keffiyeh was allegedly assaulted while he was at a playground with his son in Brooklyn, New York. In another incident 10 days later, it is alleged that a Yemeni-American Muslim woman was targeted on the New York subway by a man who called her a ""terrorist"", hit her and broke a Palestinian flag she was carrying. Ayah Zaki, a civil rights attorney for Cair in New Jersey, said that Palestinian mothers have recently been coming to her for advice on how to speak with their children about the issue. ""There's a fear-saturated conversation happening in households between the children who want to speak up about their identity, and moms who are absolutely terrified of them being in harm's way,"" Ms Zaki said. Ms Zaki said much of the racism Palestinians are facing is rooted in prejudices against Arabs and Muslims in the US that peaked after the attacks of 11 September 2001. She added the divisive political discourse in the US around the Israel-Gaza war is part of the problem. Abeer Ramadan-Shinnawi, an education consultant and mother based in Maryland, said that as a Palestinian born and raised in the US, she has often felt ""othered"" in American society - something that she said is also experienced by other minorities in the country. ""There is no sense of acceptance,"" Ms Ramadan-Shinnawi said. But amid the fear and frustration is also resilience. A few days after the Burlington shootings, two vigils were held back-to-back in the city to honour the three young Palestinian men who were shot. One was held across from the hospital in which they were recovering, where a few people arrived wearing keffiyehs. And some like Ms Bornadaro have since been reflecting on the agonising conversations they have had with their children. ""I have decided to get myself a keffiyeh again,"" she told the BBC, a few weeks after the Burlington shooting had passed. ""I used to wear one many years ago,"" she said, adding that she feels compelled to wear it again in solidarity.",2023-12-17T02:46:00.000Z

Israel Gaza: The perils of hostage rescuePublished17 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The disastrous incident in which Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops shot dead three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Friday, mistaking them for Hamas fighters despite their waving a white cloth, is a graphic illustration of the risks involved in armed hostage rescue. Maj Gen Charlie Herbert, a retired British Army general who served on 13 operational tours including Iraq and Afghanistan, told the BBC: ""As desperately sad as it is, the shooting dead of the three hostages... again calls into question IDF tactics, proportionality and distinction. One can only imagine how many civilians have been killed in similar circumstances."" The IDF says it takes great care to avoid harming civilians, but the horrific death toll in Gaza - more than 18,000 and rising - has caused Israel to be accused of indiscriminate bombing. In nearly every case of kidnap in history, those abducted stand a far better chance of emerging alive and unscathed through mediation and a deal, rather than by armed intervention. One of the first hostage cases I covered was when Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists in Yemen abducted 16 Western tourists in 1998. The British ambassador went to see the interior minister to press for a negotiated release of the hostages. Too late, he was told, the Yemeni army has already gone in. A quarter of those kidnapped were killed in the ensuing firefight, with others injured. Western and Israeli special forces have spent decades perfecting the art of hostage rescue, but even then it doesn't always go to plan. Israel's Operation Thunderbolt in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976 rescued 102 of the 106 hostages, but the commander of the Israeli commandos was killed. Today his brother, Benjamin Netanyahu, is prime minister. The 1980 SAS siege of the Iranian embassy in London is perhaps the most iconic hostage rescue of modern times, as it took place in the full glare of the TV cameras. When a British journalist, Stephen Farrell, was kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2009 he was rescued by British Special Forces. But the raid also resulted in the deaths of one of his rescuers, two civilians and his Afghan interpreter. The following year a US Navy SEAL team attempted to rescue the British aid worker Linda Norgrove, also kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan. The raid killed her kidnappers but she died from a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers. In 2012 a British Special Forces operation to free one British and one Italian hostage in Nigeria was ruined when one of the Nigerian soldiers fired his weapon prematurely, alerting the kidnappers who then murdered their captives. Many hostage cases in Yemen have been resolved peacefully over the years, usually through lengthy tribal negotiations accompanied by interminable narcotic qat-chewing sessions. But ultimately, much depends on the demands and intentions of the kidnappers. In the case of Al-Qaeda in Iraq and the Islamic State group (IS), the jihadist kidnappers never really had any intention of releasing their US and British captives. Instead they were aiming for maximum psychological impact by killing them on camera. In those situations, armed intervention, if they can be located, is usually the only option available. Hamas is something of a hybrid case. The atrocities committed in their raid into southern Israel on 7 October were gratuitously cruel and violent. Yet they have subsequently been willing to bargain the release of more than 100 hostages. Today, Israel's hostage relatives are all too aware that nearly all those already released won their freedom not by daring military action but by painstaking negotiations and mediation by Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States. To date, only one Israeli hostage, Private Ori Megedish, has been rescued by force. But doing a deal with kidnappers, especially those considered by many governments to be terrorists, can be a bitter pill to swallow. Hostage-takers will demand something in return. In the case of Hamas, that has meant releasing large numbers of prisoners from Israeli jails, pausing the fighting and significantly increasing the amount of aid getting into Gaza. Yet any further successful return of the hostages, says Gen Herbert, can only come about through diplomatic means: ""There is no effective military solution to this issue in Gaza.""",2023-12-17T00:51:26.000Z

"Israel Gaza: Hostages were carrying white cloth when shot, IDF saysPublished16 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza were shot dead while holding a white cloth, an Israeli military official says. The official said the case was ""against our rules of engagement"" and an investigation was happening at the ""highest level"". The hostages - Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 - were killed in Shejaiya on Friday. Israeli troops have been facing stiff resistance in the area near Gaza City. The case has added pressure on Israeli authorities to reach a deal for the release of the more than 120 captives who remain in Gaza. The wait of their families has gripped Israel, as the military carries out its offensive against Hamas. Speaking at a news conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there would be no let-up in the Israeli operations. ""Military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory. Without military pressure... we have nothing,"" he said. Hamas, for its part, said it had told mediators there would be no negotiations to release hostages ""unless the aggression against our people stops once and for all"". An Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an initial investigation by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) suggested the three hostages emerged shirtless from a building, with one carrying a stick with a white cloth. One of the soldiers, the official added, felt threatened, as the men were at a distance of tens of metres, declared them ""terrorists"" and opened fire. Two were immediately killed while the third, wounded, returned to the building. A cry for help was heard in Hebrew and the battalion commander ordered the troops to cease fire. The wounded hostage later re-emerged, and was shot and killed, the official said. The hostages had either been abandoned by their captors or escaped, the official added. A building with a message SOS was found in the area, and the authorities were investigating whether it was linked to the killed hostages. Meanwhile Wichian Temthong, a freed Thai hostage who was held with the three men,recalled his time with them, saying that, as they had no common language they used hand signals to communicate and give each other moral support. He was ""very shocked"" and ""saddened"" to learn of the deaths of the men he spent nearly 50 days in captivity with, he said. Since the end of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier this month, the families have urged the Israeli government to reach a new truce for at least some of the captives to be freed. The initial deal led to the release of more than 100 hostages, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. In Tel Aviv, thousands of people gathered outside the city's Museum of Art, in what is now known as Hostages Square, and called for a truce, chanting ""Bring them home now"". ""It's our biggest fear what happened - hostages who were alive are now dead,"" Naama Weinberg, whose cousin Itai Svirsky is a hostage, said at the vigil. ""We don't need bodies, or bags. Make a ceasefire until all hostages are back, alive. Every day that passes by we're just discovering more and more names of hostages that were taken alive and are now coming back dead."" The war in Gaza, launched in response to the Hamas attacks that killed around 1,200 in Israel, has killed more than 18,000 people, according to the local health authorities, and pushed hundreds of thousands of others from their homes. Vast areas of the territory have been destroyed, and the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe amid widespread shortages of basic supplies. Israeli authorities say the offensive's goal is to destroy Hamas and release the hostages. Amid mounting Palestinian civilian casualties, Israeli authorities have come under growing international pressure, including from the country's main ally, the US, but they have resisted calls for a ceasefire. Mr Netanyahu deflected the pressure again on Saturday. ""Despite grief, despite international pressure, we continue until the end, nothing will stop us,"" he said.

Samer Abudaqa: Al Jazeera cameraman killed in Gaza drone strikePublished16 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The funeral has been held of an Al Jazeera cameraman who was killed by an Israeli drone strike on Gaza. Samer Abudaqa was wounded in the strike on a school in Khan Younis on Friday along with his colleague, Wael Al-Dahdouh. Al Jazeera said Abudaqa bled to death because a heavy bombardment prevented paramedics from reaching him. The Qatar-based network said it had referred the case to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, Al Jazeera referred to Abudaqa's death as an ""assassination"", and said that its legal filing to the ICC would include repeated attacks on network crews working in the Palestinian territories. The network said Abudaqa was its 13th journalist to die on duty since it was created in 1996. Dahdouh, who lost several family members in an earlier Israeli bombing, survived the attack. During his eulogy at this colleague's funeral, Dahdouh said journalists in Gaza would ""continue to do our duty with professionalism and transparency"". He said that journalists in Gaza were carrying a ""human and noble message"" for the world amid the ongoing war and would continue to work despite Israeli attacks. According to Al Jazeera, Dahdouh was hit by shrapnel on his upper arm and managed to walk to Nasser hospital for treatment. Abudaqa also suffered shrapnel injuries, but paramedics struggled reach him as the area was under heavy bombardment from Israeli forces. Al Jazeera said the cameraman was ""left to bleed to death for over five hours,"" adding it held Israel accountable for targeting its journalists and their families. Abudaqa joined Al Jazeera in June 2004, working as a cameraman and editor. He had three sons and a daughter, and lived in the town of Abasan al-Kabira near Khan Younis. Al Jazeera's managing editor, Mohamed Moawad, described Abudaqa as ""a skilled professional but a compassionate soul who understood the power of visual storytelling"". ""His unwavering commitment to truth and storytelling has left an indelible mark on our team,"" he said on X. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 64 journalists - mostly Palestinians - have been killed since the Israel-Gaza conflict began on 7 October. The Foreign Press Association (FPA), which represents several hundred journalists working for international news organisations, said it grieved the cameraman's death. saying he was the first FPA member to be killed in the Israel-Gaza conflict. ""We consider this a grave blow to the already limited freedom of the press in Gaza and call on the army for a prompt investigation and explanation.""",2023-12-16T20:19:23.000Z

More big shipping firms stop Red Sea routes after attacksPublished16 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The world's largest shipping group, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), has announced it is diverting its ships away from the Red Sea because of an increased threat of attacks. French company CMA CGM took a similar step a day after Danish shipping giant Maersk and German transport company Hapag-Lloyd suspended Red Sea journeys. The decision comes after attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. They say they are targeting ships travelling to Israel. The Houthis have declared their support for Hamas after Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza following the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 people and saw 240 more taken hostage. Since then, Israel has killed more than 18,000 Palestinians in Gaza, Hamas health officials say. The Red Sea is one the world's most important routes for oil and fuel shipments. But the Houthis have been stepping up their attacks, using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels. They have also been firing drones and missiles towards Israel. The US said on Saturday its guided-missile destroyers had shot down 14 Houthi drones in the Red Sea. In its announcement, MSC said the situation in the area had become ""serious"". It said that its container ship MSC PALATIUM III was attacked on Friday as it was transiting the Red Sea. There were no injuries to the crew, but the ship had been taken out of service. Its ships were being re-routed via the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. In its statement, CMA CGM - the world's third-largest shipping company - said it had instructed all its container ships there ""to reach safe areas and pause their journey in safe waters with immediate effect until further notice"". Maersk, the world's second-biggest shipping firm, has described the situation as ""alarming"". ""Following the near-miss incident involving Maersk Gibraltar yesterday and yet another attack on a container vessel today, we have instructed all Maersk vessels in the area bound to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to pause their journey until further notice,"" it told the BBC on Friday. The four companies that have now suspended operations in the area comprise four of the top five in the world - and shipping experts say the decisions are going to be costly. ""It's security to the crew, to the ship itself and also insurance policies. Premiums are now going sky high if they can get insurance at all, so it's going to have serious implications on stock levels, on costs and the whole dynamics of supply chains,"" Sue Terpilowski from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, which represents companies concerned with supply chains, told the BBC. The added crewing, fuel and insurance costs are all likely to be passed on to consumers, says BBC business reporter Vivienne Nunis. The Bab al-Mandab strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - is a channel 20 miles (32km) wide, and known for being perilous to navigate. It sits between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast. It is the route by which ships can reach the Suez Canal from the south - itself a major shipping lane. Avoiding it means vessels must take much longer routes, for example navigating around southern Africa. About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year. Any ship passing through Suez to or from the Indian Ocean has to come this way.",2023-12-16T18:19:03.000Z

Israel hostages: IDF says it mistakenly killed three men held in GazaPublished16 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israeli military says it has mistakenly killed three hostages during its campaign in Gaza after they were mis-identified as a ""threat"". They were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26. The military shared its remorse and said the three were shot by troops operating in Shejaiya, in Gaza's north. More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after being captured in the 7 October attacks on Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday's incident was under investigation, and that it ""expresses deep remorse over the tragic incident and sends the families its heartfelt condolences"". ""Our national mission is to locate the missing and return all the hostages home,"" it added. Hundreds of people gathered in central Tel Aviv following the announcement and marched to an IDF military base in the city, calling on the government to secure a deal for the release of the remaining hostages. Demonstrators held candles and carried placards that read ""Bring [them] home"" and ""Hostage exchange now!"" The bodies of the three men have been returned to Israeli territory, where checks confirmed their identities. Yotam Haim, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October, was a musician who loved animals and cooking Italian food. On the morning of the Hamas attack, he called his family and told them that his house was on fire. When he opened the window for some fresh air, Yotam was kidnapped by Hamas. Speaking to the BBC before her son's death, his mother said they had messaged each other as they hid in their home shelters - before their connection was lost. Alon Shamriz was also at Kfar Aza at the time of the attack. His family gave permission for him to be named after asking earlier that his identity not be revealed. Samer Talalka, a Bedouin, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Am. An avid motorcycle enthusiast, he loved to travel in the countryside and spend time with friends. He lived in the town of Hura and worked at a chicken hatchery in the kibbutz. On the morning of 7 October, he was at work. He called his sister after the attack to tell her that he had been injured by gunfire. His father told local media they lost touch at 07:00 local time on the morning of the attacks. A photograph of him being led through Gaza was shared on Telegram. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called their deaths an ""unbearable tragedy"". ""Even on this difficult evening, we will bind up our wounds, learn the lessons and continue with a supreme effort to return all our abductees home safely,"" he said. White House spokesperson John Kirby said the killings were a ""tragic mistake,"" and that the US did not have ""perfect visibility on exactly how this operation unfolded"". More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after being captured on 7 October when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during a brief truce. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 18,800 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave so far in the war that followed. Hen Avigdori,whose wife and daughter were among the released,said he often heard people say hostages could be rescued ""by military means."" But ""there is no military way"" that would bring them back safely, he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The conclusion for every person who has both heart and mind is the same: Israel must initiate a deal to bring them back alive and not in coffins.""",2023-12-16T01:02:11.000Z

Lucy Williamson: Hamas support soars in West Bank - but full uprising can still be avoidedPublished16 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"There was speculation over whether another uprising was brewing in the West Bank, even before the Hamas attacks on Israel in October. Frequent raids by the Israeli army, emboldened by a hard-right Israeli government - following deadly attacks by Palestinians, and violent attacks on Palestinians by settlers - had already increased pressure on Palestinians there. Since the war in Gaza, those pressures have spiralled: Israeli raids into West Bank towns have become more frequent and more forceful, and many families are suffering economically after Israel withheld tax revenues used to pay public servants in the West Bank, and banned Palestinian workers from entering Israel too. There is anger at almost 20,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, and support for Hamas is rising. But despite all this, calls by the armed group for an uprising in the West Bank over the past couple of months have come and gone. Support for Hamas - and armed resistance more generally - has risen sharply since the war in Gaza began. An opinion poll by the Centre for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah found that support for Hamas in the West Bank had more than tripled. Meanwhile, support for the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah, had dropped significantly. More than 90% of respondents thought Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas should resign. But it seems that support for armed resistance, and disillusion with politics, is not translating into action on the ground. Since the war began, weekly demonstrations have been held in West Bank cities. The slogans chanted there are against Israel - but also against the Palestinian Authority. But they're usually held in city centres where there is much less risk of confrontation with Israeli soldiers, rather than at checkpoints - as happened during the last Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s. And the numbers turning out for these weekly demonstrations are smaller than they were during previous moments of tension. ""People hesitate to come when Hamas calls for demonstrations, because there is a clear security price to be paid from the Israeli response,"" said Raed Debiy, a political scientist and youth leader in Fatah. But they also don't come when Fatah calls for them, Debiy says, because ""people have lost hope in political parties"". As the actions of Israel's army in the West Bank have become harsher, and the Palestinian security services more efficient, many people fear that becoming an active member of a militant group could make them a target for arrest or assassination. More than 270 people have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October - including 70 children - according to the UN.  That's more than half the total number killed this year. Four Israelis - including three from the armed forces - have been killed by Palestinians there in the same period. An operation to arrest Palestinian gunmen in the Jenin refugee camp this week lasted several days, with frequent bursts of heavy gunfire, rocket attacks and air strikes. Hundreds of people were detained, with 60 of them handed over to the security services for further questioning. The Israeli army has also been trying to destroy infrastructure used by armed groups. This time, it claimed to have found more than a dozen underground tunnel shafts in the camp, as well as facilities for making explosives and ""observation control rooms"" to monitor Israeli forces. One young man from the camp, who was among those detained this week and released after questioning, said the reason people ignored calls by Hamas to rise up in solidarity was that the group did not supply the West Bank with enough equipment to fight the Israeli army. ""Hamas in the West Bank has not done a good job of organising itself over the last decade,"" said Khalil Shikaki, head of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah. ""The Israelis have been arresting a lot of their members. Hamas is just incapable right now in the West Bank of mobilising and organising an eruption of violence that would be sustainable."" But previous uprisings here did not rely on Hamas. The second intifada (uprising), which began in 2000, was led by members of the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah. The current leader of Fatah, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, is widely seen as trying to avoid an escalation in violence against Israel - a major shift in position from his predecessor, Yasser Arafat. His security services co-operate with Israel to arrest members of armed groups - something that is widely criticised by Palestinians. Sabri Saidam, a member of Fatah's Central Committee, denies that the party's position is at odds with public feeling in the territory, or that the Palestinian Authority (PA) is somehow avoiding a fight. ""To say that Fatah is in control and keeping the calm, [it's] as if you are hinting that there is a forceful implementation of a state of calm,"" he said. ""Nobody is forcing anything on anyone."" ""People in the West Bank know that Netanyahu is throwing down bait, through persistent attacks every night against the people of Palestine regardless of their political affiliation - because he wants to provoke the Palestinians into a confrontational mood that he will use as an excuse to escalate the situation."" The US is pushing Israel to allow a ""revitalised"" PA to govern Gaza once the war there ends. Israel has so far said it will not consider it. But the chance to govern a unified Palestinian bloc for the first time since 2006 is another incentive for the Fatah-dominated PA to prove its credentials and stop the situation in the West Bank from spiralling out of control. ""It's very clear that Fatah don't want any intifada,"" explained Raed Debiy, the party youth leader. ""They are still very keen to keep the status quo. But the grassroots of Fatah will not be controlled forever. How can you stay silent under daily assassination, daily invasion, daily violation of settlers - this will definitely lead to explosion."" In 2000, the spark for the second intifada was a visit by then-Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon to a contested holy site in Jerusalem, known to Muslims as the al-Aqsa compound and to Jews at the Temple Mount. Sharon's visit happened amid smouldering Palestinian frustration at the failure of the Oslo peace process - and, Dr Shikaki says, was ""exploited"" by Fatah's young guard to launch the uprising. A small event like this could still trigger something significant, but the situation has shifted since 2000. Now, far-right ministers in the Israeli government visit the compound, and make inflammatory claims about Israeli control of the site, without triggering a major response - at least not in the West Bank. ""We told the American administration many times that the pressure would definitely lead to some sort of reaction,"" said the senior Fatah leader, Sabri Saidam.  ""But no-one anticipated that the reaction would come from Gaza."" Where the West Bank goes from here depends partly on what follows the war in Gaza. That transition is likely to be a precarious time for the West Bank, with hopes of a unified Palestinian leadership - possibly opening the door to talks on a future Palestinian state - clashing with the opposition of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. And lifting restrictions imposed by Israel after the attacks - separating Palestinian and settler vehicles on some roads, for example - could prompt a spike in friction. But a sustained uprising, of the kind seen two decades ago, will likely require a change in the policy of the West Bank's main political movement - and possibly even a change in its leader. ""It seems Fatah remains critical for an uprising to happen,"" Dr Shikaki told me. ""And as long as Fatah and the security services are not directly involved in the preparation for such an intifada, it seems highly unlikely we'll see one emerging. ""I don't yet see Fatah or the security services on the verge of a turning point,"" he continued. ""But we're moving in that direction."" Others point to the dwindling faith in Palestinian politics to provide peace, a state, or just a better life. ""If we had anything on the political agenda, things could go quiet,"" Raed Debiy told me. ""But I'm not sure with this right-wing [Israeli] government whether there is anything solid on the table - so the only scenario I see is explosion.  It's just a matter of time.""",2023-12-16T00:21:05.000Z

Shipping firms pause Red Sea journeys over attacksPublished15 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Danish shipping company Maersk has said it is pausing all journeys through the Red Sea. The decision comes after a spate of attacks on vessels launched from a part of Yemen controlled by the Houthis - an Iran-backed rebel movement. The group has declared its support for Hamas and say it is targeting ships travelling to Israel. The Red Sea is one the world's most important routes for oil and fuel shipments. German transport company Hapag-Lloyd later said it was making a similar move. The firm owns a ship that recently came under attack, and confirmed to the BBC later on Friday it was also suspending operations in the area until Monday. In a statement to the BBC, Maersk, one of the world's biggest shipping companies, said: ""The recent attacks on commercial vessels in the area are alarming and pose a significant threat to the safety and security of seafarers. ""Following the near-miss incident involving Maersk Gibraltar yesterday and yet another attack on a container vessel today, we have instructed all Maersk vessels in the area bound to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to pause their journey until further notice.""

Maersk pausing its Red Sea shipping journeys ""could not come at a more difficult time"", director general at the Institute of Export & International Trade Marco Forgione said. ""This impacts every link in the supply chain... and will only increase the chances of critical products not making their destinations in time for Christmas,"" he added. At least two other cargo ships in the straitcame under attack on Friday. The US says one was hit with a drone and another by missiles, blaming the Houthis for both attacks. The Houthis did not confirm the drone strike, but said they did fire missiles at two boats. The group has controlled parts of Yemen since seizing power from the country's government in 2014, triggering an ongoing civil war. Speaking before the announcements by Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan - who is on a trip to the Middle East - said the Houthis were threatening freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, which is vital for oil and goods shipments. ""The United States is working with the international community, with partners from the region and from all over the world to deal with this threat,"" he said. Earlier this month,a US warship shot down three dronesfired from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen after three commercial vessels came under attack in the Red Sea. Just days before that incident, the US said another warship had captured armed men who had earlierseized an Israeli-linked tanker off Yemen's coast. Last month, the Houthis released video footage showing armed men dropping from a helicopter and seizing a cargo ship in the southern Red Sea.",2023-12-15T23:06:18.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: UN aid worker describes nightmare journey to al-Ahli HospitalPublished15 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The ""dehumanising"" treatment of paramedics, ambulances shot at, and unexploded bombs on the road. Jake Morland, a British aid worker with the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), has given the BBC his eyewitness account of a high-risk mission to transfer patients under appalling conditions in Gaza. Last Saturday, 9 December, a joint World Health Organisation (WHO)/UN/Palestine Red Crescent Society convoy of six ambulances and a truck set off from southern Gaza to deliver desperately-needed medical supplies to the al-Ahli Hospital in the north, and to transfer critically-injured patients from there to a hospital in the south. To get to al-Ahli, the convoy had to pass through the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) checkpoint at Wadi Gaza. ""The one thing we expect when we go through a checkpoint in any military setting is free access for humanitarian personnel and goods"", says Mr Morland, who has been a UN aid worker for 20 years. But this time, he says, ""we approached huge sand dunes with Israeli soldiers standing on the top with their machine guns squarely aimed at the Palestinian paramedics, at the UN vehicles, and at the UN trucks carrying medical supplies"". As they were held there for over an hour, two of the Palestinian paramedics were led away for questioning. ""We understand one was put on his knees, stripped and detained for some time until we were able to negotiate his release and carry on to Gaza,"" says Mr Morland. ""These moves (of aid) are clearly co-ordinated with the IDF,"" he says. ""We provide all the details of what's on the convoy, what it's going to do, and indeed the names of all the members of the convoy… So what was really a dehumanising treatment of Palestinian colleagues was unacceptable."" From Wadi Gaza, the aid convoy pressed on north into the old city of Gaza, which Mr Morland describes as a rabbit warren of debris-strewn streets - with unexploded ordnance on the road and beside it. ""We were also shot at. The ambulance took a couple of bullets as indeed did a truck. So it really was putting humanitarian workers' lives on the line as they went to try and save lives."" On the return journey south, they were again held up at the checkpoint - but this time they were carrying 19 critically injured patients from a tiny trauma hospital in Gaza City, so every minute counted. ""All of these patients had life-critical injuries - amputations; horrific wounds that needed immediate attention. We were held for over two hours at the checkpoint. The walking wounded were forced at gunpoint from the ambulance and again were stood in the sand to be profiled by the IDF,"" Mr Morland recalls. ""Even the children who were wounded and terrified were carried out by the paramedics, and stood there for over an hour while pictures were taken."" Eventually, as night fell and the sound of air strikes grew closer, the group had to take a difficult decision: to leave behind one of the paramedics who was still detained by the IDF. ""We had patients who were literally dying because of all the delays that were being imposed on us,"" says Mr Morland. ""I heard that one of the patients died from his injuries on the way to a hospital in the south. We think that may have been avoidable if we'd been allowed free and fair access through the checkpoint."" We put these allegations to the IDF, who told us that one of the Palestinian paramedics was detained because he was suspected of ""association with terror activities"". The IDF said they encouraged the rest of the convoy to move on south, but that of the six ambulances containing injured patients, three opted to remain with the suspect despite being encouraged to move to the southern hospital. Regarding the patient who reportedly died, the IDF said this was only reported to them days later and they have yet to be able to independently confirm it. For Jake Morland though, it was not just the hardship of getting a medical convoy through IDF lines that shocked him - it was what he witnessed in Gaza's al-Ahli Hospital that day. ""This is a hospital that normally treats 80 patients with 80 beds,"" he says. ""There are currently over 200 patients in that hospital. ""They're no longer dealing with broken bones. They're now dealing with life-threatening wounds; horrific, shrapnel wounds. ""I've never seen so many people dying in front of me. They were lying on stretchers with horrific wounds next to body bags. The scenes were horrific. And yet these Palestinian paramedics and the other aid workers that go there (to northern Gaza) time and time again - at great risk to themselves - act with compassion and dignity, and help these patients, and try to bring them to safety"". Asked what the wounds were caused by, Mr Morland says: ""They are just praying for the bombs to stop raining down on them in Gaza City, and they are all wounds and injuries of war. Pure and simple."" On Wednesday, the WHO put out its own statement, calling for healthcare and humanitarian aid workers to be protected.",2023-12-15T21:11:30.000Z

Yemen Houthi rebels claim attacks on two Red Sea cargo shipsPublished15 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Two cargo ships in the Red Sea have been attacked by missiles fired from territory in Yemen, the US says. One was hit with a drone and another by missiles, both launched from a part of Yemen controlled by the Houthis - a rebel movement backed by Iran. The Houthis did not confirm the drone strike, but said they did fire missiles at the second boat - and a third one. It is the latest attack on foreign ships in the area since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The Houthis - who seized power nine years ago - have declared their support for Hamas and say they are targeting ships travelling to Israel. The vessels came under attack in the Bab El Mandab - a narrow strait of water that is vital for global trade. Referring to the alleged drone attack, a US defence official told AFP news agency on Friday: ""We are aware that something launched from a Houthi-controlled region of Yemen struck this vessel which was damaged, and there was a report of a fire."" That container ship, called the Al Jasrah, is owned by German transport company Hapag-Lloyd, and flagged to Liberia in West Africa. A Hapag-Lloyd spokesman told AFP that the ship was on its way to Singapore from the Greek port of Piraeus. There were no casualties and the ship is now continuing towards its destination, he added. The Houthis gave no acknowledgement of a hit on the Al Jasrah, but said they had targeted the MSC Palatium and MSC Alanya with missiles. Giving their own account of a missile strike on a vessel - which they did not name - a US defence official said the hit caused a fire and a US Navy destroyer was on its way to put it out. The US is under pressure from Israel to do something about these attacks but Washington is reluctant to target the Houthi missile sites for fear of widening the Israel-Hamas conflict and triggering retaliation by Iran. Instead, it is more likely there would be a multinational naval coalition forming to protect shipping and shoot down any incoming missiles and drones. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan - who is on a trip to the Middle East - said the Houthis were a ""material threat"" to shipping and commerce in the region. He said Iran bore ultimate responsibility for the attacks, adding: ""While the Houthis are pulling the trigger, so to speak, they're being handed the gun by Iran. ""Iran has a responsibility to take steps themselves to cease these attacks, because these attacks, as I said before, are a fundamental threat to international law and international peace and security."" More incidents were also reported in the region on Friday - including a separate report elsewhere that another ship had been hijacked. The UK's maritime trade operations agency said it had received a report that a crew of a ship further east in the Arabian Sea was no longer in control of a vessel, and it was heading towards Somalia. ""At present all crew are reported as safe"" the UKMTO said. The latest attacks follow several earlier ones in the southern Red Sea, pushing up insurance premiums and potentially making some ships go all the way round Cape of Good Hope in South Africa to avoid the Red Sea. The Houthis - who are fighting Yemen's Saudi-backed government - have declared themselves part of an ""axis of resistance"" of Iran-affiliated groups opposing Israel, the US, and the wider West. They have already attacked several commercial ships this month, prompting a US destroyer to intervene, and in Novemberthey successfully hijacked a cargo ship. US, French and British warships have been patrolling the Red Sea area and have shot several missiles out of the sky. The Bab El Mandeb Strait is a 20-mile wide channel that separates Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side from Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal to or from the Indian Ocean has to come this way.",2023-12-15T16:12:22.000Z

British-Palestinians call for visa scheme for trapped relativesPublished15 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"British-Palestinian families have urged the government to create a visa scheme for stranded relatives in Gaza. A letter, sent to Foreign Secretary David Cameron on behalf of 80 families, calls for a schemesimilar to the Ukraine Family Scheme visa. A petition on Parliament's website calling for a new visa scheme also hasmore than 22,700 signatures. The government said it was ""working around the clock"" to get those ""who want to leave"" out of Gaza. More than 270 British nationals and their dependants have left Gaza so far, it added in a statement to the BBC. British nationals currently need to apply for visas for their spouses, partners and children who are in Gaza through the existing family visa route, before they come to the UK. British children under the age of 18 can also sponsor their parents for a visa. This visa route carries fees - someone outside the UK wanting to join their British spouse, for example, generally needs to pay £1,840. There is also a health surcharge to pay on top of that, which is at least £1,560 for adults. Relatives such as siblings, parents of adult children and extended family, are not eligible in most cases. The Ukraine Family Scheme was set up in March 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to allow people fleeing the war in Ukraine to move to the UK to join family members. This can be either an immediate or extended family member, including a parent of an adult child. It is free to apply to the Ukraine Family Scheme, and additional fees such as the health surcharge are waived. About 71,400 visas have been issued under the scheme so far. The letter, co-written and signed by British citizens and residents with family members in Gaza, calls for an equivalent scheme to be set up for Palestinians. ""While acknowledging the complexities of each conflict, it is disheartening for us, as British citizens and UK residents, to witness the disparity in our government response,"" it said. Not having a specific visa scheme for Palestinians, the letter said, ""stands in stark contrast to the swift and supportive actions taken in similar circumstances, such as in the Ukrainian conflict"". Palestinians in the UK ""are currently feeling a profound sense of abandonment and neglect"" as a result, it said. One of the people who signed the letter, Ibrahim Assaliya, told BBC News that his 71-year-old mother is trapped alone in Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza. ""It's a horrible situation,"" he said. ""The shelling and bombardment... she's been asked two times to leave her house to go to another place. But she can't do it, because she's disabled."" He added that ""it's miserable there - there's no food, no water. They're starving"". Dr Assaliya, his wife and five children - all British nationals - were visiting his mother in Gaza when the war broke out. They were eventually able to evacuate through the Rafah crossing last month, but this meant leaving Dr Assaliya's mother behind. In a statement sent to the BBC, the government said: ""We are working at pace to support British families who have crossed the border into Egypt, making sure any dependants who need a visa can apply for one and that appropriate checks are carried out in a timely manner.""",2023-12-15T09:28:24.000Z

How Israel jails hundreds of Palestinians without chargePublished15 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"In a family home in Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank, Yazen Alhasnat was sitting next to his mother rubbing sleep from his eyes. The 17-year-old had been released from prison the night before, nearly five months after being arrested in a 4am Israeli military raid on the home. Yazen had been held under ""administrative detention"" - a longstanding security policy, inherited from the British, that allows the Israeli state to imprison people indefinitely without charge, and without presenting any evidence against them. ""They have a secret file,"" Yazen said. ""They don't tell you what's in it."" He was back at home because he was among the 180 Palestinian children and women released from prison by Israel in the recent exchange for hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. But at the same time the Palestinian prisoners were being released, Israel was detaining people at its highest rate in years. In the weeks since 7 October, the number of people in administrative detention - already at a 30-year high of 1,300 - has shot up to more than 2,800. When Yazen was released, his family was told not to publicly celebrate in any way or to talk to the media. The same instructions were given to the families of two other teenagers who spoke to the BBC about their experiences. But all three families said they wanted to highlight the issue of administrative detention. Israel says that its use of the policy is compliant with international law and a necessary preventative measure to combat terrorism. Maurice Hirsch, a former director of military prosecutions for the West Bank, from 2013 to 2016, told the BBC that Israel was ""not only meeting international law but far surpassing it"", by allowing detainees to appeal and ensuring that their detentions were reviewed every six months. But human rights groups say Israel's expansive use of the measure is an abuse of a security law not designed to be employed at such scale, and that detainees cannot effectively defend themselves, or appeal, because they have no access to the evidence against them. ""Under international law, administrative detention should be a rare exception,"" said Jessica Montell, the executive director of HaMoked, an Israeli human rights organisation that monitors detention of Palestinians. ""You are supposed to use it when there is a present danger and no other way to prevent that danger than detaining someone. But it is clear Israel is not using it that way. It is detaining hundreds, thousands of people, without charge, and using administrative detention to shield itself from scrutiny."" Palestinians have been subject to administrative detention in this region since 1945, first under the British Mandate and then in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The law has in some very rare instances been used against Israeli settlers, but it is overwhelmingly used to detain West Bank Palestinians, including children. Administrative detainees are granted a hearing - at a military court, in front of an Israeli military judge - but the state is not required to disclose any of its evidence to the detainees or their lawyers. The detainees can then be sentenced to up to six months. But the six months can be extended indefinitely by the military court, meaning that administrative detainees have no real idea at any point how long they are going to be locked up. ""What really gets to you is the uncertainty,"" Yazen said, sitting in his living room. ""Will you finish your six months and leave? Or will you be extended for a year, for two years?"" The detainees can mount an appeal, all the way up to Israel's Supreme Court, but with no access to the evidence against them, they have nothing to base it on. Palestinians who are formally tried in the military courts have more access to evidence, but the courts boast a roughly 99% conviction rate. ""Defending Palestinians in the military courts is an almost impossible task,"" said Jerusalem-based defence lawyer Maher Hanna. ""The entire system is designed to limit a Palestinian's capacity to defend himself. It imposes harsh constraints on the defence and relieves the state prosecutor of the burden of proof."" Israel's use of the policy in the West Bank had ""crossed all lines - red, green, every colour"", Yazen's mother Sadiah said. ""We are living under a parallel system of justice."" When 16-year-old Osama Marmesh was detained, he was pulled off the street and into an unmarked car, he said. So for the first 48 hours of Osama's detention, his father Naif had no idea where he was. ""You call everyone you know to ask if they have seen your son,"" Naif said. ""You don't sleep."" Osama asked repeatedly during his arrest for the charges against him, he said, but was told each time to ""shut up"". When 17-year-old Musa Aloridat was arrested, in a 5am raid on his family home, Israeli forces pulled apart the bedroom he shared with his two younger brothers and fired a bullet into the wardrobe, smashing the glass, he said. ""They took him away in his underwear,"" Musa's father Muhannad said, holding up a picture on his phone. ""For three days we knew nothing."" Neither Yazen, Osama nor Musa, nor their parents or lawyers, were shown any evidence against them during their months of detention. When Israel published lists of the detainees to be released in the recent exchanges, in the column detailing the charges, against Yazen, Osama and Musa's names there was only the vague line, ""Threat to the security of the area"". Another version of the list said Yazen and Musa were suspected of being affiliated with Palestinian militant groups. When Osama was released, he was handed a brief charge sheet which said that on two occasions, months earlier, he had thrown a stone, ""half the size of his palm"", towards Israeli security positions. Maurice Hirsch, the former director of military prosecutions, said that it would be wrong to draw any conclusions from the limited information available. ""There's a very stark difference between the openly available evidence against these terrorists and what the intelligence information carries,"" he said. ""We see administrative detention being used by the Americans in Guantanamo, so we know that this measure is internationally recognised and accepted,"" he added. ""And since this is an internationally accepted measure, why should it be only Israel that is prevented from using it, when we are dealing with probably the highest terror threat that anyone has ever seen?"" In the end, Yazen, Osama and Musa spent between four and seven months in prison. All three said that conditions had been relatively comfortable until the Hamas attack on 7 October, when their bedsheets, blankets, extra clothes and most of their food rations were removed, and all communication with the outside world was cut off, in what they described as collective punishment for the attack. Other detainees have alleged that they werebeaten, tear-gassed or had dogs set on them. The Israeli Prison Service confirmed that it had put the prisons into emergency mode and ""reduced the living conditions of the security prisoners"" in response to the Hamas attack. Yazen, Osama and Musa were all released early, because the exchange for Israeli hostages prioritised women and children. But, according to the most recent numbers from the prison service, there are still 2,873 people being held under administrative detention in Israeli jails. The day after he got home, Musa was back in his room, where he had been grabbed from his bed by the Israeli military four months earlier. The wardrobe doors, smashed by a bullet, had been taken off to be replaced, but the room had otherwise been put back together carefully by his parents. Musa had expected to be in prison much longer, he said. His lawyer had told him there was a 90% chance his detention would be extended. All three boys said they wanted to try to finish school. But living under the constant threat of being locked up again was its own ""kind of psychological detention"", Musa said. ""They released us into a bigger prison"", Yazen said. ""There is no peace,"" Yazen's mother said, looking over at him. ""They can take you at any time."" Muath al-Khatib contributed to this report. Photographs by Joel Gunter.",2023-12-15T06:00:15.000Z

"Gaza war to take 'months', Israel tells White HousePublished14 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Israel's war in Gaza may take ""more than several months"", the country's defence minister has told US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Mr Sullivan arrived in Israel earlier on Thursday to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials. Earlier this week, Joe Biden said Israel's ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza was costing it support globally. The UN this week warned of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. During a meeting with Mr Sullivan on Thursday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that ""Hamas is a terrorist organisation that built itself over a decade to fight Israel"". ""They built infrastructure under the ground and above the ground and it is not easy to destroy them,"" Mr Gallant said. ""It will require a period of time - it will last more than several months, but we will win and we will destroy them."" While the US has repeatedly pledged its support to Israel and sent billions of dollars worth of military aid, alarm is growing over the mounting civilian death toll of the war. President Biden is also facing increasing domestic calls - including some from within his own party - to do more to pressure Israel to exercise restraint during operations in Gaza. In a brief speech on Thursday, Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that US credibility is ""on the line"", as is the ""credibility of our commitment to human rights"" as a result of the Gaza conflict and a perception that Palestinian human rights are ""conditional"". ""We cannot allow ourselves to set that precedent,"" she said. ""There is a human cost that is too high and we have reached it. That's why we must join together and call for a ceasefire now."" Mr Sullivan's visit to Israel comes just days after Mr Biden said that Israel was ""starting to lose"" international support because of the ""indiscriminate bombing that takes place"" in Gaza. On the same day, Prime Minister Netanyahu said in a statement that Israel had ""the full backing"" of the US, which had blocked ""international pressure to stop the war"". Citing two unnamed US officials, CBS - the BBC's US partner - has reported that Israeli officials have told the US that the current phase of military operations would last two or three more weeks, but would be followed by a prolonged campaign of targeted strikes aimed at Hamas leadership targets. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 18,400 people have been killed by Israeli bombing since 7 October, when a Hamas attack into Israel left about 1,200 people dead. At a news conference in Geneva on Thursday, the head of the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)  said that conditions were becoming increasingly difficult, both for Palestinian civilians in Gaza and those who have successfully crossed into Egypt. ""We meet more and more people who haven't eaten for one, two, or three days,"" he said.",2023-12-14T19:11:54.000Z

Israeli soldiers' mosque behaviour condemned by IDFPublished14 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has condemned the behaviour of some of its soldiers who were filmed singing and praying down a microphone in a mosque in Jenin in the occupied West Bank. It comes during an operation against militants in the city, which has so far left 11 Palestinians dead, the Palestinian health ministry says. The IDF said the soldiers ""will be disciplined accordingly"". It said it would also act in similar cases which have been filmed in Gaza. The clips, which are circulating on social media, show scenes of the mosque. In one recording, a song about banishing darkness, associated with the current Jewish festival of Hanukkah, is heard sung in Hebrew through a loudspeaker in a minaret. The person filming laughs and joins in with the song. Other clips show soldiers inside a mosque reciting a Jewish prayer down a microphone. The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned what it called ""a mockery of [the mosque's] sanctity"". In a statement on Thursday, the IDF said the soldiers ""acted against IDF codes of conduct within a religious establishment"". The statement said those responsible ""were immediately removed from operational activity"". It added: ""The behaviour of the soldiers in the videos is serious and stands in complete opposition to the values ​​of the IDF."" The incidents in Jenin are not the first time Israeli soldiers have been upbraided for bad behaviour filmed and posted on social media recently. Since Israeli forces have been fighting the war in Gaza from the end of October, videos have emerged including showing a soldier smashing up a toy shop, while the person filming laughs; soldiers setting fire to goods in the back of a lorry; and another rummaging through women's clothes in what appears to be a private residence. On Sunday, IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari condemned the soldiers' behaviour. ""IDF forces operate according to the values and spirit of the IDF,"" he said. ""Soldiers on the battlefield are required to act professionally and ethically, and we will not compromise on this. In any event... [the videos do not] align with IDF values, command and disciplinary steps will be taken - this is the way in the IDF."" In Jenin, meanwhile, Israeli forces have been battling Palestinian militants since the IDF launched an operation to arrest suspects there on Tuesday. Eleven Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in the city, the Palestinian health ministry says. The ministry says one of those killed was a 13-year-old boy. The IDF says it has carried out house-to-house searches in the refugee camp there and has found dozens of weapons, explosives laboratories, tunnel shafts and observation posts. It says it has also detained hundreds of suspects.",2023-12-14T17:09:02.000Z

Gaza doctor says lack of medicine is 'catastrophic' as diseases spreadPublished14 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"""The situation in the Gaza Strip and especially in Rafah is deadly."" Dr Marwan al-Hams is the director of Rafah's Martyr Mohammed Yusuf al-Najjar Hospital, which has 63 beds but is currently caring for 145 patients. The hospital is operating at more than twice its capacity because Rafah, which lies on the border with Egypt, is now home to about one million displaced Palestinians, on top of the pre-war population of 300,000. ""The lack of medicine is catastrophic and there is no space in hospitals,"" Dr Hams told the BBC. After nine weeks of war between Israel and Hamas, only 11 out of Gaza's 36 hospitals are partially functional and able to admit new patients, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Only one of them is in the north. The hospitals have been overwhelmed by casualties, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting that at least 18,600 people have been killed and 50,500 wounded. Communicable diseases are also spreading in overcrowded shelters, schools and houses, and hospitals are receiving patients with severe diarrhoea, fatigue and a high temperature. Such infections are spread through contaminated water and food, as well as close contact with other people. The WHO says there is on average one shower per 700 people and one toilet per 150 people in Gaza. People trying to survive the Israeli bombardment. It is almost impossible for them to find soap or detergent, and everything else is secondary. ""The number of people coming to hospitals and health centres with chickenpox was around 4,593... five days ago,"" said Dr Hams. Measles is also an issue, with five cases so far recorded. Dr Hams said meningitis was another serious disease and that 115 cases had been recorded across the Gaza Strip. Skin diseases and rashes have also been spreading, with 35,300 cases at the territory's hospitals last Friday. ""We've also seen 17,511 cases of people coming to hospitals and clinics with parasites,"" he said. ""We can't find the medication for them."" In addition, there have been 19,350 cases of scabies - an itchy rash caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin - which is spread through close contact. Health authorities in Gaza have registered 350 cases of dysentery, an infection of the intestines which causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus, as well as vomiting and painful stomach cramps. It is highly infectious. ""This is all in addition to food poisoning,"" said Dr Hams. ""Due to the shortage of food, people are resorting to eating old bread. They wash it, dry it in front of a fire or over a heater and then eat it."" People are also presenting with jaundice, when your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow. It can be a sign of liver disease. More than 4,100 cases of hepatitis, a term used to describe inflammation of the liver, have been registered. There are five main types of hepatitis caused by specific viruses, with Hepatitis A usually caught by consuming food and drink contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. Dr Hams called for all wells to be opened so that displaced people could get clean water. ""Still water sources or swamps, which spread disease through mosquitoes and parasites, should be shut,"" he added. He was also sure that all the medical supplies that had entered the Gaza Strip have been used up. ""We are also now at the start of the cold weather. If flu or respiratory diseases spread, we will not be able to cope as a health ministry, especially in Rafah city,"" he warned. ""We used to get 1,500 daily cases every day at the reception area only. Now, we are already getting over 2,000 people coming in."" ""If it spreads more and becomes an epidemic, it will really be catastrophic."" Dr Hams ended with a plea for more fuel, which hospitals need for their generators. Fuel deliveries have been heavily restricted by the Israelis, who say Hamas could use it for military purposes. ""We are calling on officials to open the Rafah crossing to let fuel in, which is our life blood,"" he said. ""All hospitals from north to south should get access.""",2023-12-14T15:02:29.000Z

Joshua Mollel: Tanzania says student killed in Israel by HamasPublished14 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Tanzanian student initially reported to have been taken hostage by Hamas in Israel is confirmed to have been killed, Tanzania's government says. Joshua Mollel was working as an agricultural intern at a kibbutz which was attacked by Hamas gunmen on 7 October. Tanzania's Foreign Minister January Makamba says Mr Mollel was killed immediately after he was taken hostage. Fellow student Clemence Felix Mtenga was also killed in the attack. Loitu Mollel, Joshua's father, has been notified about the death of his son, the minister added. ""We are planning to take Mr Mollel, another family member and a government official to Israel to get more information on the matter,"" Mr Makamba posted on X, formerly Twitter. The Mollel family has not yet commented. In a Facebook post, authorities in Kibbutz Nahal Oz said Mr Mollel's body was being held by Hamas. The two Tanzanian students had travelled to Israel just a month before the 7 October attack. It was initially reported that they were among the 240 people taken hostage by Hamas. According to Tanzania officials, around 350 Tanzanians live in Israel, mostly students pursuing agricultural-related studies. Dozens of residents of Kibbutz Nahal Oz were among the 1,200 people killed by Hamas fighters on 7 October.

Israel-Gaza war: What is the price of peace?Published14 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Just getting to the end of the day and surviving the night must feel like a miracle in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians ""plead for safety"", wrote Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, the main UN relief agency in Gaza, in an ""endless, deepening tragedy… hell on earth"". It must be just as hellish for the hostages taken by Hamas and for the families of their victims. War is a cruel furnace that puts humans through terrible agonies. But its heat can produce changes that seemed impossible. It happened in western Europe after World War Two. Old enemies who had killed each other for centuries chose peace. Will the war in Gaza shock Israelis and Palestinians into ending their century of conflict over the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan river? I've been watching a video of a woman wracked by grief, sitting next to the body of her husband, Muhammad Abu Shaar. As Israel and Egypt are not allowing journalists to enter Gaza, I have not met her. I haven't been able to find out her name, which was not posted alongside those of her dead husband and children. In the video, it is as if she hopes, somehow, that the power of her grief will bring him back. ""I swear, we promised to die together. You died and left me. What are we supposed to do, God? Muhammad, get up! For God's sake my beloved, I swear to God, I love you. For God's sake get up. Our children Nour and Aboud are here with you. Get up."" The two children were with their father because all three of them had just been killed by Israel. An air strike destroyed the house they were hoping would shelter them in Rafah. I visited Yonatan Zeigen at his flat in Tel Aviv. It was a comfortable home, full of his children's toys. Among the family photos I recognised his mother, Vivian Silver, who was one of Israel's leading campaigners for peace with the Palestinians. Vivian was in the family home in kibbutz Be'eri, on the border with Gaza, when Hamas attacked on 7 October. The first time I met Yonatan, in the days after their kibbutz was attacked, he was hoping his mother had been taken into Gaza as a hostage. When he heard the air raid sirens in Tel Aviv, he rang Vivian. They switched to WhatsApp as they heard gunfire and explosions in the kibbutz, hoping that if she made no noise, Hamas would bypass the house. He read out the texts they exchanged, first some black humour and suddenly serious and full of love as she realised a massacre was happening. ""She wrote me, they're inside the house, it's time to stop joking and say goodbye,"" he tells me. ""And I wrote back that 'I love you, Mum. I have no words, I'm with you'. Then she writes, 'I feel you'. And then that was it, that's the last message."" The next day, I visited her house in the kibbutz and saw it was burnt out. It took weeks for investigators to find Vivian Silver's remains in the ash left behind in the safe room. Yonatan has given up his career as a social worker to campaign for peace. ""They came into my country and killed my mother because we didn't have peace. So, to me, this just proves the point that we need it,"" he says. ""It could go either way. Catastrophes like this create changes in societies in the world. And I believe that it can lead to a better future."" Issa Amro is a Palestinian activist in Hebron in the West Bank. The city is holy to Muslims and Jews, who revere it as the burial place of the prophet Abraham. It has been a flashpoint for decades. Issa is well known in Hebron and considered a troublemaker by Israeli soldiers who have enforced a curfew on Palestinians who live near the Jewish settlement in the heart of the city. He told me he was detained and beaten after the 7 October attacks. Like Yonatan Zeigen in Tel Aviv, Issa Amro believes that the war could produce a chance for Israelis and Palestinians to lead better and safer lives. ""I think it's two opportunities. Either we choose to make it deeper and worse, or we make it as an opportunity to solve the conflict and to solve the occupation, to solve the apartheid and make living together possible because the security solution failed… only peace is the solution."" It might seem a long way off now, and many more people are going to be killed before it happens, but like every war this one will stop. All the wars in and around Gaza since Hamas seized control there in 2007 have ended the same way, with a ceasefire deal. The ceasefires all came with a fatal flaw that guaranteed the next war between Israel and Hamas. That was because no attempt was made to end a century of conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. The killing and destruction in this war are of such a different order that no one can pretend there is any kind of normality to restore. This time it must be different. That much is accepted by Palestinians and Israelis and the outside powers that matter the most. The problem is agreeing which future to try to create. The Israeli government is heading for a diplomatic row with the United States, its most important ally, about what happens after the ceasefire. President Joe Biden is exasperated by what he called Israel's ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza. Even so, he continues to back Israel, as he has since the start of the war, by deploying aircraft carriers, sending planeloads of weapons and vetoing ceasefire resolutions at the UN Security Council. In return, Joe Biden wants Israel to agree that the only way forward is revive talks to establish an independent Palestinian state. That was the objective of the Oslo peace process, which failed after years of negotiations. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not said much about how Gaza would be governed if and when he declares victory over Hamas. But he has rejected Joe Biden's plan. One constant in Netanyahu's long political career has been opposition to the independent Palestinian state that Oslo tried and failed to produce. Total victory and the unconditional surrender of anyone left alive in Hamas remain Israel's objectives. Annihilating Hamas, Mr Netanyahu believes, is the only way to rescue the hostages. A few hours before Mr Biden said Israel's bombing was indiscriminate, Mr Netanyahu made his own speech. ""I will not allow Israel to repeat the mistake of Oslo,"" he said. ""After the great sacrifice of our civilians and our soldiers, I will not allow the entry into Gaza of those who educate for terrorism, support terrorism and finance terrorism. Gaza will be neither Hamastan nor Fatahstan."" Fatahstan is a derogatory reference to the Palestinian Authority, the rival to Hamas, which recognises Israel and co-operates with it on security. Israeli domestic politics feed into Mr Netanyahu's calculations. Opinion polls indicate that many Israelis blame him for the intelligence and security failures that allowed Hamas to break into Israel with such force. By doubling down on his opposition to Palestinian self-determination, Mr Netanyahu is trying to regain the trust of the right-wing Jewish nationalists who support his government. Yonatan Zeigen, the son of the slain peace campaigner Vivian Silver, says his mother would have been heartbroken to see the war, believing that wars cause more wars. ""I think she would have said 'not in my name'… a war, if we're not too naïve, should be a means, right? But it feels like this war is a cause in itself, of revenge."" Yonatan senses a new opportunity, to put peace back on Israel's political agenda. Peace campaigners were prominent in Israel until they were discredited as an armed Palestinian uprising erupted after the Oslo process collapsed in 2000. The idea of peace with the Palestinians vanished from mainstream Israeli politics. Now, Yonatan hopes, it is inching its way back. ""Absolutely. You couldn't even say the word. And now people are talking about it."" Issa Amro, the Palestinian activist in Hebron, told me life there is much harder for Palestinians since 7 October. ""It got much worse. Ten times worse. More restrictions. More violence. More intimidation. People don't feel safe at all. People don't have enough food to eat. People don't get any access to a social life. No schools, no kindergartens, no work. It's a collective punishment inside an area which is very restricted."" Issa got into a verbal spat with a group of Israeli soldiers while we were walking with him through the centre of Hebron. One of them, in combat gear, with an assault rifle and large pistol in a holster, wearing a black mask that only exposed his eyes, listened closely as Issa told me that peace was the only way ahead as there was no military solution to the conflict. The soldier wouldn't give his name when he butted into the conversation. ""You don't know what it's like to grow up in Israel with neighbours like this,"" he said. ""Gay rights, they beat the women, I saw this with my eyes. Yes. They kill their daughters if they have an affair with someone they don't like. They [Palestinians] are violent. I know them, I live with them. They don't want peace… They hate me. You know I can feel it. I know all the stuff they are telling. I don't talk to them."" A chance for a peaceful future, for an independent Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel that the Americans, the British and many other countries say they want, will not emerge without sustained diplomatic and political will and determination. The old Oslo format, of negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis brokered by the Americans, ended in failure. If there is a next time, one idea mentioned by senior Western diplomats is to make Palestinian independence a crucial part of a broader package of change in the Middle East. Israel would be offered the prize of mutual recognition with Saudi Arabia, if they made the concessions necessary for Palestinian independence. Jordan and Egypt would be crucial players, as countries who have made lasting peace with Israel. Also vital would be Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, immensely wealthy Gulf states. Like the Saudis, they need peace in the Middle East as they spend hundreds of billions establishing themselves as global players. A blueprint already exists. Twenty years ago, the Saudi peace plan offered Israel full recognition and peace with Arab states, in return for a viable and sovereign Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank, with a capital in East Jerusalem. It could be relaunched by extending the existing Abraham Accords between Israel and some Arab countries, but adding to it the price tag of a Palestinian state. It is an ambitious idea, that would not happen without new Israeli and Palestinian leaders who believed in the project. The Americans could mediate, though they would have to be even-handed, something they have never managed before. Both sides would have to be prepared to make painful compromises on cherished beliefs, especially concerning territory. Political storms would break over leaders prepared to take risks for peace. Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist in 1995 when he tried to make peace with the Palestinians. An Islamist extremist killed Egypt's President Anwar Sadat because he made peace with Israel. And the war in Gaza would have to end as soon as possible. If it spreads, nightmare scenarios include desperate Palestinians breaching the Egyptian border as Israeli tanks close in and the escalation into full-scale war of the current cross-border exchanges between Israel and the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah. So much needs to go right for peace to have a chance. So much has already gone wrong that peace might just be impossible.",2023-12-14T06:01:30.000Z

"Biden committed to freeing US hostages in Gaza, families sayPublished13 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The families of US hostages held by Hamas say they believe President Joe Biden is doing everything he can to secure the release of their loved ones. The administration is ""completely committed"" to getting them home, one relative said after meeting Mr Biden. There are believed to be eight Americans still held in Gaza. The meeting came a day after Mr Biden said Israel is starting to lose global support over its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of the enclave. This was the first in-person meeting family members of US hostages had with the president after a first virtual meeting in October. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer were also in attendance. After the meeting, thirteen relatives held up photos of their loved ones as they spoke to the press outside the White House. Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of 35-year-old hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, said they came away with the feeling that they ""could have no better friend in Washington or in the White House than President Biden himself and his administration"". The meeting came as Mr Biden faces scrutiny over his strongest criticism yet of Israel's leadership, made on Tuesday during a fundraising event. The president said that while Israel ""has most of the world"" supporting it, ""they're starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place"". He also said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must ""change"", adding that ""this government in Israel is making it very difficult"". Mr Biden has offered unwavering public support to the country since Hamas launched its attacks on 7 October. His remarks align with his administration's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to ""put a premium on human life"". On Wednesday, the White House said Mr Biden's remarks ""reflected the reality of global opinion"". ""Our support for Israel is not diminished,"" White House security spokesman John Kirby said at a press conference. ""But we have had concerns and we have expressed those concerns about the prosecution of this military campaign, even while acknowledging that it's Hamas that started this."" Mr Kirby added: ""It's reflective of our constant efforts to urge the Israelis to be as precise and careful as possible"". Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during a brief truce The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 18,600 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave since the start of the war. Mr Kirby did not go into detail on what Mr Biden meant when he said Mr Netanyahu must ""change"", saying: ""It's not for us to to dictate terms to a foreign sovereign government."" On Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu said Israel had received the ""full backing"" of the US for its ground war as well as its goal of destroying Hamas and recovering hostages. ""Yes, there is disagreement about 'the day after Hamas' and I hope that we will reach [an] agreement here as well,"" he said. Meanwhile, families of some other Americans detained abroad stood outside the White House on Wednesday as the president hosted relatives of hostages in Gaza. They said the administration has ignored repeated pleas for a meeting. ""We're glad the president is meeting with the [families of] the Gaza hostages, but when he tells all of our families - or his staff tells all of our families - that we're the highest priority, these actions clearly don't point to that,"" Harrison Li, whose father, Kai Li, has been detained in China since 2012, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.",2023-12-13T23:40:22.000Z

Refaat Alareer: UCL urged to issue statement on ex student's deathPublished13 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Students and staff at a London university have expressed their frustration about it not issuing a statement after a former student died. Dr Refaat Alareer, who taught English literature at the Islamic University in Gaza, studied at University College London (UCL) in 2007. The writer and literary scholar was killed in an air strike in Gaza. A UCL spokesperson said: ""We are working to support all those affected by this."" A vigil organised by UCL Palestine solidarity, a network of staff and students at UCL, was held on Wednesday afternoon. ""Dr Refaat is beloved by a lot of people in the academic community,"" Amna Ghaffar, a UCL student from east London told BBC London. ""He was a UCL alumna and we feel the institution is not recognising or acknowledging or paying respect to him."" Since his death, Dr Alareer's final poem ""If I must die"" has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online. ""He wanted to teach English to Palestinians so that their voices could be heard beyond the borders of their country,"" Ms Ghaffar, who is from Pakistan, said. ""He was a voice for the voiceless."" BBC London reporter Alpa Patel, who was at the vigil, said students of many different nationalities including Turkish, Egyptian and British, cried and held hands during the poetry reading. The poem was read out in different languages, including Greek, to reflect the diversity of the university, and to show how Dr Alareer had touched the lives of many people, she added. Rana, from north London and who was also at the vigil, said Dr Alareer was a ""beloved lecturer"". ""His students loved him, adored him, and people have read his work,"" she said. ""I think he meant a lot to all of us. ""He's not the first cultural figure that has been killed by Israeli forces. ""This administration of the university is still refusing to condemn his killing, to issue a statement."" Dr Alareer's father-in-law said that the academic died along with his brother and sister and four of her children on 6 December. He had declined to leave northern Gaza following the start of Israeli operations in the area. A UCL spokesperson said: ""The ongoing violence and suffering in Gaza and Israel is terribly distressing and we recognise the deep impact it has had on UCL's community, many of whom are directly affected and greatly concerned.

"Israel to continue Gaza war with or without international support, FM saysPublished13 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Israel's foreign minister has said it will continue the war in Gaza ""with or without international support"". A ceasefire at this stage of the conflict would be ""a gift"" to Hamas and allow it to return, Eli Cohen warned. Israel is facing mounting pressure over the number of Palestinian civilians killed by its military in Gaza and the worsening humanitarian crisis there. On Tuesday, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. And in his strongest comments yet, US President Joe Biden said Israel was losing support worldwide because of its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza. Intense fighting continued in both the north and south of Gaza on Wednesday, while heavy rains worsened conditions for the hundreds of thousands of displaced people who are living in makeshift tents or out in the open. A senior UN aid official also warned that the Palestinian territory faced a ""public health disaster"" because of the collapse of its medical system and the spread of infectious diseases in overcrowded shelters. The war was triggered by an unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people - including many women and children - were killed and about 240 taken hostage. Since then, more than 18,600 people have been killed in Gaza, about 70% of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. At Tuesday's emergency session of the UN General Assembly, 153 member states voted in favour of a non-binding resolution demanding an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"" in Gaza, and ""the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, as well as ensuring humanitarian access"". Eight states joined Israel and the US in voting against the resolution, including Austria and the Czech Republic, while the UK and Germany were among the 23 states which abstained. It was put forward by Arab and Muslim states after the US vetoed a binding resolution at the UN Security Council last Friday, saying an immediate ceasefire would allow Hamas to regroup. The day after the General Assembly vote and President Biden's warning, Eli Cohen told a visiting diplomat: ""Israel will continue the war against Hamas, with or without international support."" ""A ceasefire at the current stage is a gift to the terrorist organisation Hamas, and will allow it to return and threaten the residents of Israel,"" he added, according to a statement from his office. So far, the US has supported Israel's opposition to a pause in hostilities. But senior American officials are increasingly demonstrating discontent with the way Israel is conducting its offensive. On 2 December, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin warned that Israel risked replacing a ""tactical victory with a strategic defeat"" if it did not sufficiently protect civilians in Gaza. Disagreements are also emerging about what a post-war Gaza will look like. On Thursday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will arrive in Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli media report that their discussions will include a timetable for the end of the war - and some suggest that Mr Netanyahu, by openly disagreeing with the Biden administration, is trying to appeal to his right-wing base. Speaking with Israeli military commanders serving in Gaza on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Netanyahu said the war would ""continue until the end, until the victory, until the elimination of Hamas"". And, reflecting ""international pressures"", he added that ""nothing will stop us"". However, as previous Israeli wars show, calls for a ceasefire will soon become too loud to be ignored. Israel is continuing to pound Gaza in the meantime, but Hamas and its allies are fighting back. Tuesday was the deadliest day for the Israeli military since its ground offensive began on 27 October. The military said 10 soldiers were killed, almost all of them in a co-ordinated ambush in the Shejaiya district of Gaza City, where there has been a focus of the ground operation in recent days. Hamas fighters ""threw explosives at the soldiers and shot at them from inside a residential building in which underground terror infrastructure was also located"", according to a statement. Hamas said the announcement confirmed the ""failure"" of Israel's leaders and military in the face of ""strong resistance"" from the group's armed wing. The UN's local humanitarian co-ordinator, Lynn Hastings, told reporters: ""What is happening on the ground is not going to bring peace and security to either the Palestinians or Israelis for many, many years, if not generations to come. So a ceasefire is in the interest of everybody at the moment."" She warned that the number of Palestinians being killed and injured was going up significantly every day and that almost half of Gaza's 2.3 million population had fled to the southern Rafah area, on the border with Egypt, in an attempt to avoid the Israeli bombardment. The collapse of the healthcare system, with only one-third of hospitals partially functioning, combined with the unsanitary conditions at overcrowded shelters, also meant there was ""a textbook formula for epidemics and a public health disaster"", she added. The UN estimates there have so far been 360,000 cases of infectious diseases, including meningitis, respiratory infections and diarrhoea, which is a leading cause of death among children under the age of five worldwide.",2023-12-13T21:14:10.000Z

Support for Hamas grows among Palestinians in West BankPublished13 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Since the war in Gaza began, Israel's military operations in the occupied West Bank have become more frequent, and more forceful. The northern city of Jenin - the epicentre of these raids before the Hamas attacks - is now a weekly battleground. The Palestinian teenagers I met who were running from the army there on Tuesday had the sceptical dismissive attitudes of much older men - mocking the Palestinian president and his appeals to the world for protection against Israel's occupation. Behind them, Israel's armoured bulldozers and military jeeps moved around the entrance to Jenin refugee camp, explosions and gunfire from across the city echoing along the deserted, shuttered streets. The walls of this city are covered with the pictures of young men killed by Israeli forces - some of them members of armed groups like Hamas, proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others. The posters and the faces are refreshed, year after year. Six men were killed in the operation here on Tuesday; four of them in a drone strike, witnesses said. Israel says its operations in the West Bank are targeting members of armed groups, often those with Israeli blood on their hands. But the director of Jenin's hospital, Wissam Bakr, said a chronically ill 13-year-old child also died after being blocked from reaching medical care. ""The persistence of the incursions into Jenin, and the killing of young people - this will make the people more and more angry, because every day we lose one of our friends,"" he said. ""This will not bring peace for Israel - this will bring more and more resistance."" On 7 October, Hamas gunmen from Gaza attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 others hostage. More than 18,400 people are said to have been killed in Gaza during the war that followed. Here in the West Bank, 271 Palestinians, including 69 children, have been killed since the attacks - more than half the total number for the year. Almost all of them have been killed by Israeli forces, according to the United Nations. Since the Hamas attacks, support for armed resistance has risen in many parts of the West Bank - in places like Nablus and Jenin. ""I see it in the voices of people, in the music they play in their cars, from Facebook or social media posts, from my debates with my students,"" said Raed Debiy, a political scientist and youth leader for the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah, which dominates the Palestinian Authority (PA). He told me the attacks were ""a turning point"" for Palestinians, just as they were a shocking turning point for Israelis. ""The people, especially the new generation, are backing Hamas now, more than at any other moment,"" he told me. ""In the previous 30 years, there were no models, no idols for the new generation; now they see there is something different, a different story is being created."" Even his 11-year-old nephew, he said, had little respect for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, but idolises Hamas military spokesman Abu Obeida - ""because he protects us"". ""Palestinian youth had priorities and wish lists about owning a house, or getting a degree,"" explained West Bank political scientist Amjad Bushkar. ""But after 7 October, I think these priorities have totally changed. There are rising voices for full liberation of the homeland through resistance - whether that resistance is peaceful or armed."" Dr Bushkar told me that he had spent a total of nine years in Israeli jails, and had been a member of Hamas's student wing in the past. Seven members of his family had been arrested since the 7 October attacks, he added. Hamas members in the West Bank have regularly been targeted by Palestinian security forces - not just Israeli ones - since the group took control of Gaza by force in 2007, a year after it won parliamentary elections. But now, Dr Bushkar said, something had changed. ""Both Fatah and Hamas are well aware that they are complementary to each other, and I think we'll see real integration between the two movements."" ""The Palestinian Authority realised that targeting Hamas would not eradicate it because it's an ideological movement rooted within the Palestinian people; and Hamas is fully aware that it cannot establish an independent [Palestinian] state without the help of Fatah."" Some senior figures in the Palestinian administration - though not President Abbas - are now openly talking about the benefits of a united political front. Earlier this month, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said in an interview with Bloomberg that the Palestinian Authority's preferred outcome of the war in Gaza would be for Hamas to join a unity government led by the PA. Qossay Hamed, an expert in Hamas at Al-Quds Open University in Ramallah, says the crisis in Gaza could end up strengthening the movement's political wing, at the expense of its military one. ""In any revolutionary movement, there should be a political harvest to [military] actions,"" he said. ""There are so many trends within Hamas. And there are internal clashes. I think there will be more room for the political trend within Hamas, especially after this war, when the whole world will not be tolerant towards them."" Israel says its goal in Gaza is to destroy Hamas, and has ruled out a role for either it or Fatah in Gaza's future government. ""I will not allow the entry into Gaza of those who teach terrorism, support terrorism and finance terrorism,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. ""Gaza will be neither Hamas-stan nor Fatah-stan."" Some Palestinians privately say the price paid by Gaza for the Hamas attacks is too high. But others say the group's brutal tactics worked in forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners - and contrast its impact sharply with that of the Palestinian Authority, set up 30 years ago after the Oslo Accords to work with Israel on a future Palestinian State. An opinion poll carried out between 22 November and 2 December by a respected Palestinian think-tank, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), found that support for Hamas had more than tripled in the West Bank compared to three months ago. Supporters of Hamas were still in a minority, but 70% of the respondents said armed struggle was the best means of ending the Israeli occupation. By contrast, support for President Abbas had dropped sharply following the Hamas attacks, the survey found, with more than 90% of Palestinians in the West Bank calling for his resignation. Since the Hamas attacks, said Amjad Bushkar, ""the world and the international community have put the Palestinian cause on its list of priorities."" Widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, the PA has also been unable to pay its civil servants or police since the Hamas attacks, because the war in Gaza caused a rift over the tax revenues transferred by Israel each month. While Hamas flags and slogans multiplied here in the wake of each busload of Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the PA's president and security forces were conspicuously absent. Israel may be determined to deny Hamas power in Gaza, but here in the West Bank its influence is already spreading.",2023-12-13T16:07:47.000Z

Martin Lewis: 'I have dark days mental health wise'Published13 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing,"Martin Lewis has opened up about the ""horrendous"" pressure he feels giving advice on personal finance. The financial journalist and ""Money Saving Expert"" told BBC Radio 4's the Media Show he finds the stress ""very difficult to manage"". ""If somebody applies for this [benefit] and it stops another benefit, I wouldn't sleep at night,"" he revealed. Mr Lewis's MoneySavingExpert website was sold for £87m in 2012 and he hosts ""The Martin Lewis Money Show"" on ITV. The personal finance expert, who received a CBE last year for services to broadcasting and consumer rights, said being seen as a trusted voice was ""an incredible compliment"". But speaking about that pressure and the toll it had taken on his mental health, Mr Lewis said he had ""dark days"". ""One of the greatest difficulties is you think, 'Have I got it right? Have I got it right?"" he explained. ""People think I'm incredibly robust because of the way I talk and I come across. Actually, I'm quite a brittle person,"" he said. ""I'm tired."" Speaking about managing the stress of his job, Mr Lewis said he takes regular breaks and does breathing exercises and ""huge amounts of exercise"". But despite this, the 51-year-old said he was not a good example of how to deal with stress, and mentioned ""periods where I find it very, very difficult to deal with"". The financial journalist, who also hosts the ""The Martin Lewis Podcast"" on BBC Radio 5 Live, opened up about the pressure he felt to speak publicly about the war in Gaza. Mr Lewis, who is Jewish, said calls for him to do so were ""bordering anti-Semitic"". ""I have never been asked about political situations in China, or Saudi Arabia, or South America,"" he explained. ""I'm British. I'm a British Jew. My parents were born in Britain. All my grandparents were born in Britain. All my great grandparents were born in Britain. ""And yet people somehow felt they could demand that, as a British Jew, I should be talking on a conflict in the Middle East, when I never talk about international affairs."" In the end Mr Lewis did speak publicly about the conflict, saying he felt obliged to do so ""to stop people asking"". Addressing his silence on the issue on X, formerly Twitter, in early October he said: ""Frankly I've struggled to process it, and felt the combined guttural fear for relations in Israel, anxiety about possible anti-Semitic backlash here, and grief over the loss of life of beautiful children both Israeli and Palestinian were things I didn't want to be public about."" He said that Israel had the right to defend itself, but his heart went out to ""innocent civilians in Gaza who will bear a brunt for the actions of Hamas"".

Israel Gaza: UN General Assembly demands immediate ceasefirePublished13 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The UN General Assembly has overwhelmingly adopted a non-binding resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. On Tuesday, 153 member states in the 193-strong assembly voted in favour and 10 including the US and Israel against, with 23 abstentions. Palestinian representative Riyad Mansour said it was a ""historic day"". Israel's envoy Gilad Erdan said before the vote that a ""ceasefire only serves to prolong Hamas's reign of terror"". Senior Hamas official Bassem Naeem told the BBC that the passing of the resolution confirmed that ""the prevailing international will is in favour of stopping the aggression against the Palestinian people"". Although the US voted against the resolution, US President Joe Biden had earlier warned that Israel was losing international support because of ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Palestinians. He also expressed disagreement over plans for the future of the Gaza Strip, saying the Israeli government appeared opposed a two-state solution with the Palestinians. Tuesday's vote was the second attempt by the General Assembly to stop hostilities. In October, it had called for ""a humanitarian truce"" in a resolution adopted with 121 votes in favour, 14 against and 44 abstentions. Although non-binding, such resolutions are seen as a powerful measure of international opinion, analysts say. UN Secretary General António Guterres has long been pushing for a humanitarian ceasefire to prevent a ""complete breakdown of public order"" in Gaza. Last Friday, the UN Security Council - the body tasked with global peace and security issues - failed to adopt a draft resolution calling for a truce in Gaza. The US - one of the council's five veto-wielding council members - blocked the move. Israel has been carrying out air strikes and a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip after a Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October in which Israeli officials say 1,200 were killed and another 240 taken hostage. Some of the abductees were later released during a brief truce. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says Israel has killed more than 18,200 people and injured at least 50,000, including many women and children, during its ongoing military operation.",2023-12-13T03:32:50.000Z

"Israel losing global support over Gaza bombing, Biden saysPublished12 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","US President Joe Biden has said Israel is starting to lose global support over its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza. His comments, made to donors at a fundraising event on Tuesday, marked his strongest criticism yet of Israel's leadership. Mr Biden has offered unwavering public support to the country since Hamas launched its attacks on 7 October. And while he reiterated that Israel could count on US backing, he issued a direct warning to its government. ""Israel's security can rest on the United States, but right now it has more than the United States. It has the European Union, it has Europe, it has most of the world,"" he told donors to his 2024 re-election campaign in Washington. ""But they're starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place,"" he said. Mr Biden, however, added that there was ""no question about the need to take on Hamas"" and Israel had ""every right"" to do so. The US leader has faced growing pressure, including from within his own Democratic Party, to rein in Israel's military campaign. His remarks align with his administration's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to ""put a premium on human life"" and give clearer instructions to allow people to avoid the conflict. Senior US officials have also displayed increasing discontent at Israel's military response. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 18,400 people have been killed by Israeli bombing since 7 October, when Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter and killed 1,200 people. In a statement later on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had received the ""full backing"" of the US for its ground war as well as its goal of destroying Hamas and recovering hostages. He added that Washington had blocked ""international pressure to stop the war"". ""Yes, there is disagreement about 'the day after Hamas' and I hope that we will reach [an] agreement here as well,"" he said. Mr Biden alluded to the pair's disagreement in his comments on Tuesday and said Mr Netanyahu had to ""change"" his government as well as his stance on a two-state solution, which top US officials have been promoting as the post-war path. That proposal is favoured by the international community to end the decades-long conflict, and would lead to the creation of an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank existing alongside Israel. ""This is the most conservative government in Israel's history,"" Mr Biden said. ""This government in Israel is making it very difficult for him. They don't want a two-state solution."" His comments reflect the emerging disagreements about what direction to take after the war. Mr Netanyahu has said he opposes US calls to have the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, take over control of Gaza. While Mr Biden's words were his bluntest yet, senior American officials have increasingly expressed discontent with Israel's military campaign. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said just days ago that there was a ""gap"" between pledges by Israeli authorities to spare civilians in Gaza and the reality on the ground.",2023-12-12T23:51:58.000Z

Israel determined to finish Gaza operation despite civilian sufferingPublished12 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel is on holiday. Schools are out, and away from the frontline areas the shopping centres are full. Cake shops are bursting with the doughnuts that Jews like to eat during Hanukkah, the current religious festival. It is different the closer you get to the fighting. Along the Gaza border, the area known by Israelis as the ""envelope"", tanks and troops are moving, civilians are mostly elsewhere and it looks like a war zone. In the north, along the border with Lebanon, communities have also been evacuated and the military continues to exchange fire with Iran's strongest ally, Hezbollah. But casual visitors might be able to deceive themselves that life has somehow returned to ""normal"" in central Israel, the broad swathe of land between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. A sharp reminder of how wrong that impression would be came as I drove down to Tel Aviv. The air raid sirens started, and the red alert app Israelis have on their phones sent out warnings as cars swerved onto the hard shoulder so the people inside could stop to take cover. Other drivers accelerated to speed out of the area. In the confusion, three cars managed to crash into each other. We pulled over as a group of women left their car and held each other in a tight, terrified embrace. Overhead, vapour trails from the Iron Dome anti-missile system arched towards the rockets coming from Gaza, loud explosions cracking across a deep blue sky as they downed most of the projectiles. One man was injured, in Holon, just off the highway. The fact that Hamas can still attack Israel is more proof that it is not beaten. The response of the motorists shows the depth of the trauma Hamas has inflicted on Israel, which is without doubt good news for the leaders of Hamas. Israel believes they are somewhere under Gaza, in some part of the tunnel system. ""First of all, forget everything you thought you knew about Israel before 7 October. It's all changed,"" Amos Yadlin, a retired major-general said as we set up for an interview in his office in Tel Aviv, overlooking Israel's defence ministry. Mr Yadlin was a veteran fighter pilot who retired as head of Israeli military intelligence. We decided to interview him to get an idea of Israel's war strategy. In the end everything he said was just as interesting for what it said about mood in Israel. Mr Yadlin repeatedly compared Israel's fight against Hamas to World War Two. He was defending the huge number of killings by Israel of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, and making the point that eliminating Hamas was vital for Israel's future. In a reference to the destruction of Dresden in Germany by the RAF in 1945, Mr Yadlin said: ""You bombed Dresden with 120,000 people, killed women, children. We are trying to avoid this collateral damage. We ask them to leave. We ask them to go to the southern part of Gaza."" I reminded him that Israel was also bombing the areas they had told Palestinians would be safe. Mr Yadlin insisted Israel was bombing Hamas, not civilians. ""No, we didn't bomb them. We bombed the Hamas targets. Only Hamas targets and Hamas uses them as a human shield."" He dismissed criticisms by the Biden administration in the US that Israel was killing too many Palestinian civilians. He said Israel was more careful about avoiding civilian casualties than the US and UK had been when they were bombing jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq. His interpretation is not shared by former generals involved in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. A senior British officer told me he was appalled by Israel's disdain for the laws of war that mandate the protection of civilians. He said it would not be allowed in the British army. Amos Yadlin, who still advises his successors in the Israeli military, believes Israel needs more time to reach its ambitious objectives in Gaza. It wants to rescue its hostages, kill the leaders of Hamas, annihilate it as a military formation that can threaten Israelis and destroy its capacity to govern. I pointed out that even though the US had vetoed the latest ceasefire resolution it was signalling that Israel had weeks not months to finish what it wanted to do. ""It is not enough to achieve the goal,"" said Mr Yadlin. ""If there is a ceasefire without returning the rest of the hostages, there will be no ceasefire."" Israel has an immensely powerful army and the backing of the US. But it is discovering that for all its deep conviction that it has no choice other than to destroy Gaza to eradicate Hamas, allies as well as critics are appalled by the way it has killed more than 18,000 Palestinians, of which perhaps half were children. Israel has also discovered, as the Americans and others warned, that fighting a determined and prepared enemy in a built-up area is one of the hardest military jobs. As Amos Yadlin indicated, though, the Israelis look determined to push through the criticism to reach their objectives. After that comes the thorny issue about the governance and reconstruction of Gaza. Mr Yadlin said there would be no long Israeli occupation of Gaza, but if the current leadership's determination to control the strip for the foreseeable future does not change, occupation looks certain.",2023-12-12T13:04:01.000Z

MK Strinda: Yemen's rebel Houthis hit Norwegian tanker with missilePublished12 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have hit a Norwegian tanker with at least one missile, causing a fire. There were no casualties in the attack. A Houthi spokesman said the MT Strinda was delivering oil to Israel, but the ship's owners said it was headed to Italy with feedstock for biofuel. The group has vowed to block ships of any nation heading to Israel until Israel stops its offensive on Gaza, in what the Houthis say is a show of support for the Palestinians. The United States has said it will consider ""appropriate responses"" to any such attacks, which it describes as ""fully enabled by Iran"". Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said in a televised statement that the ship was targeted on Monday after its crew refused to respond to warnings. He said the group had prevented several ships from passing through Yemeni waters in recent days. The MT Strinda was attacked in the Bab El Mandeb strait at the entrance to the Red Sea. The missile caused a fire on board the ship but it was extinguished and the ship was able to make its way on to a safe port, ship owners J Ludwig Mowinckels Rederi said in a statement. They added that the 30-member crew, who are all Indian citizens, were unharmed. A US Navy destroyer provided assistance to the MT Strinda after receiving a mayday call, US officials said. The Bab El Mandeb Strait is a 20-mile wide channel that separates Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side from Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal to or from the Indian Ocean has to come this way. The Houthis - who are fighting Yemen's Saudi-backed government - have declared themselves part of an ""axis of resistance"" of Iran-affiliated groups opposing Israel, the US, and the wider West. They have already attacked several commercial ships this month, prompting a US destroyer to intervene, and in Novemberthey seized the cargo ship Galaxy Leader.",2023-12-12T11:39:07.000Z

Son's 'sheer happiness' at hugging mother after Hamas releasePublished12 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A British-Israeli man has told BBC London of his ""sheer happiness"" at hugging his mother after she was released by Hamas. Ada Sagi, who turned 75 when being held captive, was freed on 28 November, the fifth day of the Israel-Hamas truce. Her son Noam Sagi, who lives in north London, said: ""For 53 days I was visualising that moment. Everything came into it. ""It was just squeezing and squeezing and squeezing and pinching myself."" Mr Sagi said waiting to discover whether his mother was on the daily list of captives Hamas planned to free was ""the most difficult part"" of the ordeal. ""We knew how many people are there - and everybody's doing the maths. Chances are getting slimmer and slimmer, but I kept myself going. ""I knew that it will come and it doesn't matter if it's day one or day five. She will be out. I'm absolutely convinced. So when it happened it was just sheer happiness."" Mr Sagi said his mother was recovering well from her experience: ""Of course she went through a huge, huge ordeal. Physically, she is generally OK. ""I always said if she's physically fine, her brain and her positive mindset will always be her strength. ""She will have to go through a lot.

Eyal Waldman: Israeli tech billionaire hopes for peace despite daughter's killingPublished12 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Danielle Waldman danced the last dance of her young life some time before dawn on 7 October. Soon afterwards she and her friends had to run for their lives, but they never made it home. There is a record of her final moments - a brief video, recorded on a phone. It gives only a hint of the horrors to come. The 24-year-old sits in the back seat of a car with two friends - strands of her long curly hair escaping from her grey hoodie. All three are casually dressed. There are fleeting smiles and overlapping voices, and a glimpse of blue wrist bands from the Supernova trance music festival they have just attended. They are trying to remain calm, but they are being hunted. Danielle's boyfriend Noam Shai is in front, behind the wheel. ""Want me to drive very, very fast?"" he asks. ""I know how to do that."" ""Correct,"" replies a female passenger. A bearded young man sitting beside Danielle tries to provide reassurance. ""We will be all right,"" he says. ""Everything is ok, right?"" Next, from the front, an urgent demand - ""left, or right?"" Then the video ends. Minutes later Hamas gunmen riddled the car with bullets. Noam, Danielle, and their friends in the back seat were killed - as were nearly 360 other Israelis who went to dance at the festival in the Negev desert near the Gaza border. The front seat passenger was taken hostage. When the sun set on that day, 1,200 Israelis had been slaughtered - either at the festival or in their homes in kibbutzim close to the border. It was the worst loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust. The vast majority were civilians. Since then, Israel has gone to war in Gaza ""to eradicate Hamas"", and Palestinians in turn have been slaughtered. Almost 18,000 people have been killed at last count - according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza - 7,300 of them children. In Gaza now, as in Israel after 7 October, parents are burying their children. And for every parent, Palestinian or Israeli, the loss is incomparable. We meet Danielle's father Eyal in his art-filled office, high above Tel Aviv. He has long been a tech giant - who founded the Israeli chip maker Mellanox Technologies, and sold it for $6.8bn in 2019. But now he is simply a father, raw with grief, robbed of his youngest daughter. ""She was an amazing girl,"" he says in a voice laden with love and grief. ""She loved to dance. She loved animals. She loved people. She had many, many friends. She loved to snowboard, to scuba dive, to go on a motorcycle with Noam."" When he got word that Danielle was missing, he raced back from a trip to Indonesia - getting permission to land in Israel, even though the airspace was closed. Three hours later he went looking for her, tracking her apple watch. It was a journey into a battlefield. ""We were close to an engagement with seven terrorists, creatures, call them what you want,"" he says. ""They had killed three or four soldiers. After that we took three officers in a jeep and went down south."" He found the bullet-riddled car, but there was no sign of Danielle. ""There was a lot of blood inside the car,"" he says. ""I was hoping she wasn't in the car, or that she was wounded but was able to escape, or was taken hostage."" Two days later her body was found. ""Everything she touched was with a smile. She never did anything wrong to anyone,"" he says, choking back tears. ""She just loved doing good things. And they [Hamas] just murdered her for no reason."" Despite the brutal killing of his youngest daughter, Eyal Waldman still believes that the Palestinians should have a state - and soon. ""We need to change leadership on both sides. And then I hope in two to four years we'll be able to do peace and build two states for the two people and be able to live together next to each other,"" he says. But before that, he wants something else. ""Anyone that was responsible, anyone that was associated with what happened on 7 October 2023, will be eliminated. And we will take care of that,"" he says firmly. ""We know exactly who came, who raped, who butchered.  We have videos, we have their cell phone numbers. We know who they are. We can eliminate them. And I think we can eliminate Hamas."" The former Israeli army officer knows about waging war. He served in an elite unit - the Golani Brigade. He also knows about building bridges. In the past he opened a design centre in Gaza, donated $360,000 (£286,200) to a hospital there, and created jobs for Palestinians both in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank. Does he regret that now? ""No, I don't,"" he replies without hesitation. ""I think we need to do everything we can to make this place the best place to live in. ""And we need to stop killing each other and find a way to live together. I have been working for two-and-half decades trying to make peace."" Just 10 days before Danielle was killed, she was chatting with her father about the future. ""She said 'you know Dad, I decided I am going to marry Noam,'"" he recalls. ""They were together for six years, and it was an amazing friendship and partnership. They were going to live in the country, raising kids. She wanted many kids and a lot of dogs and horses."" The devoted young couple - who never got the chance to marry - were buried together instead.",2023-12-12T06:00:34.000Z

Israel Gaza: 'Where is mum? Where is grandma? Where did they go?'Published12 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"""When he asks me about his family I can't answer. Instead, I take a deep breath and try to avoid the question in a childlike way by changing the subject."" Moein Abu Rezk is the only surviving relative of his four-year-old nephew, Omar, who is in a critical condition at Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip. Omar had to have his left hand amputated and was left with a large, open wound on his right leg, smaller wounds on his chest and face, and a dislocated jaw following an Israeli air strike that Moein says killed 35 members of his family, including his mother, father and grandmother. So far, Moein has decided to not tell Omar about their deaths, in case it causes his condition to deteriorate before he can be medically evacuated from Gaza via Egypt, hopefully as part of an initiative by the United Arab Emirates government and the Emirates Red Crescent. ""He needs to be told the information in a specific way so that he doesn't go into shock or go into a state that I can't control,"" Moein told BBC Arabic in a series of voice notes on Sunday night. ""He knows that he hasn't seen any of them, and yet he feels the need to ask: 'Where is mum? Where is grandma? Where did they go?'"" However, it is not guaranteed that an ambulance will transport Omar to the Egyptian border because of the intense fighting and heavy bombardment around what is known as Gaza's Middle Area. Israeli ground forces have already divided Gaza in two, fully encircling Gaza City in the first two months of the war with Hamas - which Israel, the UK and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation. Tanks and troops are now pushing deep into the southern city of Khan Younis. The main highway from Deir al-Balah has been declared a ""battlefield"", leaving people in the Middle Area with only one supposedly safe evacuation route along the Mediterranean coast. Many Palestinians living in the north of Gaza sought refuge in the Middle Area after the Israeli military ordered them to evacuate their homes and move south of the Wadi Gaza river two months ago. That order came at the start of the war triggered by a cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others were taken hostage. Since then, more than18,200 people have been killed in Gaza according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Omar is among the more than 49,000 other people so far reported injured. The Israeli military says its forces are operating to eliminate terrorists, locate weaponry and destroy terrorist infrastructure, and that more than 22,000 targets have been struck since the start of the war. Moein told BBC Arabic that Omar and his family had been visiting his grandmother's house in Nuseirat camp, just to the north of Deir al-Balah, when it was bombed without any prior warning from the Israeli military. ""We have never seen missiles like that before. The missile falls and destroys the whole residential area around it,"" he recalled. ""Luckily, the house had an opening through which [Omar] fell. But his left arm was [so badly] injured that it had to be amputated immediately. ""[On Saturday], he lost about three units of blood and his haemoglobin [concentration] fell from 9.5 to 7.4, so he had to be transferred to surgery for a blood transfer."" Moein said the situation at the hospital was so bad that doctors could not find a bed for Omar despite the severity of his injuries, forcing him to wait in a corridor while doctors and nurses treated him as best as they could. ""All medical equipment and tools are so limited to the extent that the we have to deal with the situation in a more practical rather than a healthy way. ""There are no painkillers so we have to joke around and try to make him laugh in order to calm him."" Moein conceded that this method only worked some of the time but added: ""We don't have any other option."" He said he hoped that Omar would be transported next Thursday to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and then taken to a hospital for specialist treatment. Lena Shakora, her husband and three young sons have so far survived the Israeli bombardment, but she said they were still living a ""nightmare"". They fled their home in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City and are currently sheltering in a house in an agricultural area outside Deir al-Balah with their relatives. ""I wake up every day remembering that we are at war [and] people are starving. Its torture to be displaced from your house and find no food,"" Lena told BBC Arabic on Sunday night. ""My family and I are sitting with 40 individuals in one room and all the windows are [blown out] because of the bombing. We are basically sitting outdoors... and it is very cold and people are humiliated."" Lena said her sons had hurt their backs because they were having to carry containers of water. And to make matters worse, the water is not clean because treatment plants and pumps are not working because of a lack of fuel. The family was also being forced to eat contaminated food because shops were empty and they had not received any aid, she added. ""Our greatest hope is to have flour so that we can bake, and even that we can bake it on [clean] wood."" ""People go around collecting whatever wood they can find. But the bread comes out contaminated because it is cooked on wood from the scene of a bombing,"" she explained. The UN said on Sunday that it had been unable to distribute outside the southern city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, in recent days because of the intensity of hostilities and restrictions on movement.

Claudine Gay: Pressure mounts on Harvard president to step downPublished11 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Harvard University President Claudine Gay is facing mounting pressure to resign over her congressional testimony on antisemitism on campus. Dr Gay, 53, was forced to apologise after she failed to say whether students calling for the genocide of Jewish people would be disciplined. Hundreds of Harvard faculty rallied behind her over the weekend, urging the university not to fire her. Her fate may be decided at a meeting of the Harvard Corporation on Monday. Dr Gay's comments, which were widely criticised, were made at a House of Representatives hearing last week alongside Elizabeth Magill and Sally Kornbluth, her counterparts from the University of Pennsylvania and MIT. During tense questioning from Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Dr Gay said she found calls for the genocide of Jews personally abhorrent but whether it would constitute a violation of Harvard's code of conduct regarding bullying and harassment depended on the context. ""I am sorry,"" Dr Gay said in a subsequent interview with the Crimson, Harvard's campus newspaper. ""When words amplify distress and pain, I don't know how you could feel anything but regret."" The 13-member Harvard Corporation - one of the institution's two governing bodies - is scheduled to meet later on Monday and will reportedly discuss Dr Gay's fate and the school's potential courses of action. Over the weekend, more than 500 faculty members signed a petition calling on Harvard to ""resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard's commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of President Claudine Gay"". By mid-morning on Monday, the number of faculty members who signed the letter had risen to nearly 700. Alison Frank Johnson, one of the petition's co-authors,told Reutersthat staff ""don't want to lose her because of a political stunt"". ""I get the impression that many people don't know how much support she has as a scholar, colleague, and administrator within the university, including from people who sometimes disagree with her,"" she said. In July, Dr Gay became Harvard's first black president in its 368-year history. More than 70 members of Congress have called for her resignation alongside Ms Magill's and Dr Kornbluth's, In a letter, the mostly Republican lawmakers referred to the college presidents' answers as ""abhorrent"" and standing ""in stark contrast to the principles we expect leaders of top academic institutions to uphold"". ""It is hard to imagine any Jewish or Israeli student, faculty or staff feeling safe when presidents of your member institutions could not say that calls for the genocide of Jews would have clear consequences on your campus,"" the letter added. On Saturday, President Magill announced that she had ""voluntarily tendered her resignation"". It came after a major university donor withdrew a $100m (£80m) grant in protest over her comments. Following Ms Magill's announcement that she was stepping down, Ms Stefanik again took aim at Dr Gay and Dr Kornbluth. ""One down, two to go,"" she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. College campuses across the US have been the scene of frequent pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli protests, raising concerns about both Islamophobia and antisemitism.",2023-12-11T18:02:34.000Z

The Conservatives national leadership has said they are steadfastly committed to Israel's right to defend itself. Mr Rangzeb said: ""I decided to leave the party on Friday and sent my resignation.

Responding to Mr Rangzeb's resignation, a spokesperson for the party said: ""The Conservative Party is steadfastly committed to supporting Israel and its right to defend itself, whilst recognising this must be in line with international law.

Manchester scientist escapes Gaza after threat of attackPublished10 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Manchester scientist who stayed in Gaza to help his relatives has now fled after he said the Israeli Army told them to evacuate. As a British-Palestinian dual national, Mohammed Ghalayini could have escaped early after war broke out in October. ""This apartment block - it's been my family's home since the 1930s and my sister was born there. To leave it forcibly under threat of death is a horrible, horrible feeling,"" he said. He reached Egypt via Rafah on Sunday. As he travelled to Cairo, he said: ""I'm so relieved but also very sad to be leaving Gaza, to be leaving my friends, my family members behind - knowing they're at risk of death, injury, loss of their properties, loss of their livelihoods, loss of their land. ""Without a ceasefire, they're at risk of all that - we need a ceasefire now."" On Friday, the US blocked a resolution at the UN Security Council calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. The UK abstained while the remaining 13 on the 15-member group voted in favour. Mr Ghalayini said: ""I'm so grateful to the British consular staff who have done a great job in facilitating in getting me and many others out."" The 44-year-old was visiting relatives when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. The air pollution scientist remained with his family as the death toll in Gaza climbed tomore than 18,000. He previously told BBC North West Tonight aboutstruggles to get enough food and sleep, saying ""We're not eating enough and we're kind of running around the streets trying to get stuff and wondering where the next bomb will fall."" ""Leaving could mean death and injury and staying could mean death and injury, so it's basically being between a rock and a hard place.""

"Israel-Hamas war: Ceasefire in Gaza chances shrinking, Qatar saysPublished10 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Israel's bombardment of Gaza is ""narrowing the window"" for a new truce, the Qatari prime minister has said. Speaking at the Doha Forum, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar would continue its efforts to pressure both sides into a ceasefire. The Gulf state played a key role negotiating the week-long pause in violence at the end of November, which allowed the release of hostages. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday ""the war is in full swing"". He said in recent days ""dozens of Hamas terrorists"" had surrendered, and were ""laying down their weapons and handing themselves over to our heroic fighters"". ""This is the beginning of the end for Hamas,"" he said. The comments come as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen. On Sunday afternoon, the Hamas-run health agency in Gaza said almost 18,000 Palestinians had now been killed. In an audio message to Al Jazeera, Hamas's armed wing said the temporary ceasefire had ""proved its credibility"" and that no more hostages would be freed until Israel engaged in talks. In the message, spokesman Abu Ubaida also said Hamas fighters had fully or partially destroyed 180 military vehicles and killed ""a large number"" of Israeli soldiers, and that it is still inflicting blows on Israel, and ""what is coming is greater"". At the conference in Doha, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said the area had become ""hell on earth"" and was ""definitely the worst situation I have ever seen"". Also speaking at the conference, Palestinian PM Mohammad Shtayyeh said Israel ""should not be allowed to keep violating international humanitarian law"", and called for international sanctions. Mr Shtayyeh represents the Palestinian Authority, the organisation which operates in the West Bank and which is separate to the Hamas government operating in Gaza. As the meeting took place in Doha, in the south of Gaza fighting continued to rage. The city of Khan Younis, the place people were told to head to to escape the fighting in the north, is now under heavy bombardments - with Israel asking civilians to leave its centre. Speaking to BBC News, senior Israeli adviser Mark Regev said there was going to be ""difficult fighting"" in Khan Younis, and urged civilians to ""move to safe zones"" - with Israeli tanks reaching the centre of the city on Sunday evening. Civilians in the city have been pictured collecting bodies and mourning family members killed in fighting. When asked about the situation in what Israel calls safe areas, Mr Regev said his country has made a maximum effort to try to safeguard civilian lives. Civilians in Gaza have formerly been advised to make their way to a ""safe zone"" at al-Mawasi. Measuring just 8.5 sq km (3.3 sq miles), the areais smaller than London's Heathrow Airport, has few buildings and largely consists of sandy dunes and agricultural land. Meanwhile, Israel has also been engaging in international diplomacy - calling out its allies for an inconsistent approach. ""You cannot on the one hand support the elimination of Hamas and on other pressure us to end the war, which would prevent the elimination of Hamas,"" said Mr Netanyahu while briefing his cabinet. He was speaking two days after 13 members of the UN Security Council supported a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire, with the US vetoing the move and the UK abstaining. Israel also denied a claim by UNRWA chief Mr Lazzarini that it was trying to force Gazans out of the region and into Egypt - somethingpreviously reported in Israeli media. The World Health Organization has also taken the unusual step of passing a resolution calling for immediate medical access to Gaza, with its director-general earlier calling the situation in the area ""catastrophic"".",2023-12-10T18:10:50.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: Video shows Gaza detainees allegedly 'surrendering guns' - what we knowPublished10 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Images of detained and stripped Palestinians apparently surrendering some weapons to Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip have prompted speculation about the circumstances of the events and the filming. Initially, two videos of what appeared to be the same scene - a man in his underwear obeying instructions to lay down a weapon - but with slight differences, sparked speculation it may have been filmed repeatedly for separate ""takes"". BBC Verify has examined the footage and established that both clips came from a continuous sequence in which three guns in total appear to be handed over. But questions remain about the exact circumstances and the release of the videos. Two separate clips depicting the same scene but with minor discrepancies circulated on social media on Saturday 9 December. This led to accusations that different ""takes"" had been filmed. Some pointed to how the man in the video was holding the gun in a different hand in the two scenes. BBC Verify has found that in fact these videos are different sections of a continuous sequence, not separate takes, and the same man is going to and fro bringing different guns to the pavement with their detached ammunition. In the footage, dozens of other men are seen standing across the road watching, also in their underwear, many of them with their arms aloft and holding identity cards. BBC Verify has established they are in front of a UN school in Beit Lahia, north of the Jabalia refugee camp. One video, which we know was shot first because of the position of the sun, shows the man placing a gun from his right hand on top of another on the pavement. In the next video, with the sun lower, the man places a different gun on top of those from his left hand. Still images corroborate and bookend this sequence, with one showing the very first gun being placed, and another showing the resulting three guns and magazines on the pavement. There are still some questions raised by the footage. Notably, the man is being held at gunpoint and issued directions from off-screen, so it's unclear whether he is ""surrendering"" the weapons or just moving them as instructed. Given he is already in his underwear and he cannot have been concealing them on his person, it's unlikely Israeli troops did not know about these weapons, suggesting this may be performed for the camera, rather than as an act of authentic surrender. We also don't know if he, or any of the other individuals in the video, have any involvement with Hamas or the 7 October attack. In one of the videos, the end of what seems to be a DSLR zoom lens is briefly visible. There were also photographs circulating alongside the videos which were captured from a slightly different angle. This suggests the events were filmed or photographed by more than one person or camera. Over the past week, emotive images of Palestinians being detained in Gaza have provoked strong reactions - with some expressing concern over the treatment of the prisoners, and the Red Cross saying all detainees must be treated in accordance with international law. But Israel has been keen to show evidence it's making progress against Hamas in Gaza. On Sunday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""In recent days, dozens of Hamas terrorists have surrendered to our forces. They are laying down their weapons and handing themselves over to our heroic fighters. ""It will take more time, the war is in full swing, but this is the beginning of the end for Hamas."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not respond directly to questions about the circumstances of these videos but a spokesperson told the BBC that detained individuals ""are treated in accordance with international law"". ""It is often necessary for terror suspects to hand over their clothes such that their clothes can be searched and to ensure that they are not concealing explosive vests or other weaponry.""

Carl Skau, deputy director of the UN World Food Programme, said only a fraction of supplies needed have been able to enter the Strip - and nine out of 10 people cannot eat every day. Conditions in Gaza have made deliveries ""almost impossible"", Mr Skau said. Israel says it must continue air strikes on Gaza to eliminate Hamas and bring Israeli hostages home. Israel Defence Forces spokesman Lt Col Richard Hecht told the BBC on Saturday that ""any death and pain to a civilian is painful, but we don't have an alternative"". ""We are doing everything we can to get as much as possible inside the Gaza Strip,"" he said. Herzi Halevi, chief of staff of the IDF, was filmed telling soldiers the army has to ""press harder"" because ""we're seeing terrorists surrendering... a sign their network is collapsing"". Meanwhile, the Biden administration has used an emergency law to bypass Congress and authorise the sale of some 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106m (£85m) to Israel. Movement in and out of Gaza has been heavily restricted since 7 October, when Hamas fighters broke through Israel's heavily-guarded perimeter fence - killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages. In response, Israel closed its borders with Gaza and began launching air strikes on the territory, restricting aid deliveries which Gazans heavily relied on. The Hamas-run health ministry says Israel has killed more than 17,700 Gazans in its retaliatory campaign, including more than 7,000 children. Only the Rafah crossing bordering Egypt has been open, allowing limited quantities of aid to reach Gaza. This week Israel agreed to open the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel into Gaza in the next few days - but only for the inspection of aid lorries. The trucks would then go to Rafah to cross into Gaza. Mr Skau said nothing had prepared him for the ""fear, the chaos, and the despair"" he and his WFP team encountered during their trip to Gaza this week. They witnessed ""confusion at warehouses, distribution points with thousands of desperate hungry people, supermarkets with bare shelves, and overcrowded shelters with bursting bathrooms,"" he said. International pressure and a temporary seven-day ceasefire last month had allowed some badly-needed aid to enter the Gaza Strip, but the WFP insists a second border crossing is now needed to meet demand. Nine out of 10 families in some areas are spending ""a full day and night without any food at all"", according to Mr Skau. People in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, a city now surrounded on two fronts by Israeli tanks, say the situation there is dire. Dr Ahmed Moghrabi, head of the plastic surgery and burns unit in the city's only remaining health facility, Nasser hospital, fought back tears as he spoke to the BBC about the lack of food. ""I have a daughter, three years old, always she ask me (for) some sweets, some apple, some fruits. I can't provide. I feel helpless,"" he said. ""There is not enough food, there is not enough food, only rice, only rice can you believe? We eat once, once a day, only."" Khan Younis has been the focus of heavy air strikes in recent days and the boss of Nasser hospital there said his team had ""lost control"" over the numbers of dead and wounded arriving at the facility. Israel says Hamas leaders are hiding in Khan Younis, possibly in an underground network of tunnels, and that it is fighting house to house and ""shaft to shaft"" to destroy the group's military capabilities. Speaking on Saturday, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, accused the United States of being complicit in war crimes, after it vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Out of 15 of the Security Council members, 13 countries voted in favour of the resolution calling for a ceasefire. The UK abstained from the vote and the US was the only country to vote against the resolution. Mr Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, said he held Washington responsible for ""the bloodshed of Palestinian children, women, and elderly in Gaza at the hands of [Israeli] occupation forces"". The US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, defended the veto, and said the resolution was calling for an ""unsustainable ceasefire"" which ""would leave Hamas in place able to repeat what it did on October 7"". Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Saturday he appreciated the ""correct stance"" the US had taken at the security council. A seven-day temporary ceasefire ended just over a week ago. Under the truce, 78 hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for 180 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. There are still more than 100 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. On Saturday, it was confirmed that Israeli hostage Sahar Baruch, 25, had been killed, his kibbutz and a hostages' group said in a statement. It comes after the armed wing of Hamas released a video on Friday which it said showed the bloody aftermath of a failed IDF operation to free an Israeli hostage.",2023-12-10T01:56:00.000Z

Palestinian recounts being stripped and driven away by Israeli armyPublished9 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A 22-year-old Palestinian has told the BBC how he was detained with dozens of others by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in northern Gaza on Thursday. Footage verified by the BBCshows a group of men stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground and being guarded by Israeli soldiers. The man says he was forced to sit in the street for hours, handcuffed and blindfolded, before being driven away. An Israeli official said the soldiers were searching for Hamas members. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the BBC they were looking for those ""responsible for the massacre of October 7"". The detainees were taken by truck from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza to an unknown place, according to the young man - who asked to remain anonymous for his safety. Once they arrived, they were randomly selected for questioning and interrogated about their relationship with Hamas, he adds. One image - which has not yet been verified by the BBC - shows men blindfolded, kneeling in what appears to be a large pit of bulldozed sand. The 22-year-old says the place that he, his father, brother and five cousins were taken to was sandy - and they were left there almost naked but given a blanket at night. After questioning, he says he was taken to another location before being told to go home, arriving at around 01:40 in the morning. ""They released all of us, except my father and eldest cousin. My father works for UNRWA. I don't know why they took him,"" he said. ""We walked barefoot down the street in the dark, with the roads full of rocks and glass."" UNRWA is the UN agency that supports Palestinian refugees. Mr Regev said IDF troops had been gathering people to find out who was responsible for the Hamas attacks in Israel. They were trying to determine ""whose name and face fits with the photographs of people beheading people, or raping women and so forth"", he said. Mr Regev claimed it was possible that some were UN workers, but suggested that did not ""automatically"" mean they were not also Hamas members. He said Hamas controlled the workers' union of UNRWA and that the group had ""activists in all sorts of organisations, that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone"". Juliette Touma, UNRWA director of communications, told the BBC that the agency ""has a scrutiny and screening process for all its staff"" which it shares ""with the host governments where we work"". ""For Gaza and the West Bank, UNRWA also shares these lists with the government of Israel as the occupying power,"" she said. UNRWA has never received a response from Israel to these lists, she added. A second Palestinian, Mohammed Lubbad, who lives in Belgium, said on Instagram that his brother Ibrahim was detained along with 10 other family members. Mr Lubbad told the BBC he had video-called his brother on WhatsApp two hours before he was taken away. ""He told me that our house and the entire village in Beit Lahia were surrounded by Israeli forces,"" he said. ""Later, I saw the video posted on social media [of the truck]. I immediately recognised my brother and also identified some of our neighbours."" Mr Lubbad said all his relatives were eventually released except for two cousins - Ahmed Lubbad, 35, a teacher and father-of-four, and Ayman Lubbad, a human rights activist and father-of-three. He said his family were ""innocent civilians with no military affiliation"". One of the detained men, Diaa al-Kahlout - who has not been released yet, according to a colleague - is a correspondent for The New Arab, or Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, a London-based pan-Arab outlet. Some of those later released told al-Kahlout's family that the journalist had been transferred to Zikim military base in Israel, according to Lamis Andoni of The New Arab. ""We have no idea about his fate,"" she told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""The photos and videos of these men are horrifying. I'm shocked."" Describing Mr al-Kahlout as very ambitious, she said he ""always had a smile on his face, but like many Gazans, felt suffocated"". Ms Andoni said her outlet was speaking to Israeli forces through the UN. She said the IDF's suggestion the men were just suspects and that forces needed to investigate them was ""not a good answer"".",2023-12-09T12:19:10.000Z

Mum surprises twins in school reunion after fleeing GazaPublished9 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A mother has told how seeing her twins in a surprise reunion at their school after fleeing the Israel Gaza war was ""the best moment in my life"". Islam Alashi, 37, left her Merseyside home to visit her sick father in Gaza just before the conflict broke out. Her husband said their five-year-old children cried for her every day as they waited for her return. They finally got their wish when she got home and surprised them at Riverside Primary School in Seacombe. ""I lost hope that I would get back to my kids,"" Ms Alashi said. She said she felt she would never see them again, adding: ""I just cuddled them in my love. ""I feel like I'm just living a new life now. This is my new beginning with them."" Ms Alashi, from Wallasey, travelled to Gaza on 16 September and was staying near the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, which became the scene of some of the heaviest fighting. Her husband Feiz Chihaoui said she had feared she may not survive as the death toll in Gaza climbed. After her aunt's house was damaged by shelling, Ms Alashi - whose mother died during the coronavirus pandemic - walked eight miles (13 km) to Khan Younis, accompanied by her 70-year-old father in a donkey cart. They stayed in a large tented refugee camp, drinking rainwater to survive. Ms Alashi said the ""bombing was everywhere"", adding: ""You can't sleep at all, not even for a minute."" She was eventually allowed to cross the border into Egypt but said she felt ""guilty"" she had to leave her relatives behind. With Yemeni passports, they were not allowed to cross. She said she faced a ""very bad choice"" even though they encouraged her to leave. Since her return to the UK, Mr Chihaoui said he is ""very happy"" to have the family reunited but it was also ""hard"" for his wife to readjust. He said ""her happiness is not complete"" until her relatives can also escape Gaza. Megan Whitehead-Thompson, who works at the school, said since Ms Alashi's return her twins had become more ""excited and happy"". ""It's just been wonderful to see them all back together again,"" she said. Headteacher Christina Lahive, who joined staff in lobbying the government for Ms Alashi's return, added: ""I just can't tell you how wonderful that moment was."" Ms Alashi, who works as an English teacher for older students, described the school staff as ""my heroes"". She added: ""They helped me a lot to escape from the war. So everything they did for me and for the kids and for my husband, I will never forget it."" Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,XandInstagram?

Israel-Gaza: The status quo is smashed. The future is messy and dangerousPublished9 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"At the end of the war that started on 7 October lies a big, unknown place called the future. The old status quo was dangerous and painful, especially for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. But it was familiar. Then after 7 October it was smashed by the Hamas attacks, and Israel's response. The shock of war can speed up change, when it sweeps away old thinking, forcing difficult choices for a better future. Or it drives leaders and their citizens deeper into their bunkers, as they prepare for the next round. For more than a century, Jews and Arabs have been confronting each other, and sometimes going to war, over control of the small, highly coveted piece of land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. Perhaps the safest, saddest bet is to assume that the conflict, reshaped, will go on. After all, that is what has happened after every other Middle East war since 1948, when Israel won its independence. But there are other options. Here are some of the arguments made by individuals at the centre of events. Israel's prime minister has not spelt out his plan for the day after, if he has one. His opponents in Israel, who blame him for security and intelligence failures that made the Hamas attacks on 7 October possible, say Netanyahu's only real plan is to stay in power and avoid conviction on the serious corruption charges he faces. Netanyahu built his career on the message he was Mr Security, the only man who could keep Israel safe. Hamas shattered his brand, which was already badly damaged by political strife inside Israel. The prime minister's broad statements about what happens after the war, assuming Israel can declare victory, all point to continued occupation of Gaza. Israeli officials have reportedly talked about setting up buffer zones along the border, without offering any details. Netanyahu has rejected a role for foreign peacekeepers, assuming they can be found. Jordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi has already said that Arab states would not ""clean the mess"" left by Israel. ""There will be no Arab troops going to Gaza. None. We are not going to be seen as the enemy."" Netanyahu has also dismissed US President Joe Biden's plan to replace Hamas with the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas. Netanyahu claims the PA cannot be trusted and supports terrorism, even though it recognises Israel and cooperates with it on security. President Biden's vision of the future is very different to Benjamin Netanyahu's. Biden continues to give considerable military, diplomatic and emotional support to Israelis. He visited, embraced the families of hostages and has ordered his diplomats at the United Nations Security Council to use the US veto to block ceasefire resolutions. Biden ordered two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region and has sent Israel vast amounts of weaponry. In return, the US president wants Israel to return to some kind of revitalised peace process. He wants the Palestinian Authority (PA) eventually to run Gaza while Israel agrees arrangements for an independent Palestine alongside Israel. The Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas agrees. He has largely been a bystander since 7 October. In a rare interview this week, with Reuters, he said there should be a peace conference after the war to work out a political solution that would lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The ""two state solution"" has been the official objective of America and its western allies since the early 1990s. Years of negotiations to make it happen failed. For almost a quarter of a century, since the peace process collapsed, the phrase has been an empty slogan. Biden wants to revive it, arguing correctly that only a political solution will end the conflict. Biden sent his vice president, Kamala Harris, to Dubai last week to make a speech laying out America's red lines for Gaza on the day after. She laid out five principles. ""No forcible displacement, no re-occupation, no siege or blockade, no reduction in territory, and no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism."" ""We want to see a unified Gaza and West Bank under the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian voices and aspirations must be at the centre of this work."" In and out of office, Benjamin Netanyahu has worked consistently hard to thwart Palestinian independence. It is safe to say he is not about to change his mind. If the two-state solution can be revived, it won't happen while he is prime minister. I went to see Simcha Rotman at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, where he is a prominent MP for the far-right Religious Zionist Party. The government of Benjamin Netanyahu depends on the support of Rotman's party and other hard-line Jewish nationalists. Their power comes from the dynamism of the movement to settle Jews on the land captured in 1967. From that moment of victory, some Israelis were set on extending the Zionist enterprise into the newly occupied Palestinian territories: the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Since 1967 they have been highly successful, despite being forced to leave Gaza when Israel pulled out in 2005. Around 700,000 Israeli Jews now live in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Settler leaders are in the cabinet, and their enterprise is at the centre of Israeli politics. Now that Israel is fighting Hamas, vowing to smash the organisation once and for all, Jewish nationalists see the biggest opportunity they have had since 1967, when Israel beat all its Arab neighbours in a war that lasted for six days. Since 7 October, armed settlers in the West Bank, backed by soldiers and police, have prevented Palestinian farmers from harvesting their olives or tending their fields. Settlers have paved illegal roads and sought to entrench themselves even deeper by consolidating outposts that are illegal under Israeli as well as international law. Posters are everywhere demanding the return of Jewish settlers to Gaza. Settlers have also killed Palestinians and invaded their homes. Men with bulldozers came at night to destroy the tiny village of Khirbet Zanuta, near Hebron. Its population of 200 Palestinians had already left, forced out by armed and aggressive settlers. International law says an occupying power should not settle its citizens in land it has captured. Israel says the law does not apply. ""Occupation is not the word,"" Simcha Rotman told me at the Knesset. ""You cannot occupy your own land. Israel is not an occupier in Israel because that's the land of Israel."" For Simcha Rotman and other Jewish nationalists, Gaza is also part of the land of Israel. ""We need to make sure that the only people that are in charge of our security in the land of Israel are the IDF [Israel Defence Forces]. We cannot have any terrorist organisation, doesn't matter what its name. Would it be Hamas? Would it be Fatah? Doesn't matter. The terrorist organisation cannot have control of our lives."" If there are Palestinian elections after the 7 October war ends, Mustafa Barghouti is likely to run for president. He is the secretary general of the Palestine National Initiative. It wants to be the third force in Palestinian politics, an alternative to the Islamist extremists in Hamas and to Fatah, the faction led by President Mahmoud Abbas, which it regards as corrupt and incompetent. Barghouthi believes resistance to occupation is legitimate and legal, though he wants it to be non-violent. In his office in Ramallah on the West Bank, Mustafa Barghouthi told me that Israel is using the war to deliver a crushing blow not just to Hamas but to the idea of Palestinian independence and freedom. Like many Palestinians, Barghouthi sees what's happening as a grim echo of the events of 1948 when Israel won its independence and more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced at gunpoint to leave their homes in what became Israel. Palestinians call it al-Naqba, ""the catastrophe"" and believe Israel wants it to happen again. ""I am 100% sure that their main goal right from the beginning was the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, complete ethnic cleansing of Gaza, trying to push people to Egypt, a terrible war crime. And if they managed to do so, I think their next goal will be to try to ethnically cleanse the West Bank and force people to join them."" ""If they fail to ethnically cleanse all Gazans, I am sure that Netanyahu's plan B is to annexe Gaza City and the north of Gaza completely to Israel and claim it as a security area."" Barghouthi warns that Israel faces dire prospects if its troops stay in Gaza long term. ""Israel did that before and it didn't work. And there will be resistance to their occupation, which they cannot tolerate. And that's why Netanyahu's goal really is to ethnically cleanse people. He wants to have military control of Gaza without people. He knows very well that Gaza with people is something that is unmanageable."" Barghouthi believes Gaza should be part of a democratic Palestinian state. ""We Palestinians are grown up people. We don't need any patronage of anybody. And no, we don't need any other country to tell us how we should rule ourselves."" This crisis looks as if it will have more chapters. The US veto of the latest ceasefire resolution at the UN Security Council gives Israel more time to wage war. But that extra time is not indefinite, and continued Biden support for Israel carries a political price in America's coming election year. Influential members of his own Democratic party oppose what he's doing, and so do younger voters whose support he needs. The Biden Administration is already deeply uncomfortable that Israel is ignoring its repeated requests to protect civilians and respect the laws of war. Israel may struggle to achieve the crushing victory Benjamin Netanyahu has promised. He set a high bar for victory; not just annihilating Hamas as a military force, but also destroying its capacity to govern. Israel's vast military power, reinforced by American resupply, has not yet destroyed the capacity of Hamas to fight. The Hamas creed of Islamist nationalism is also embedded in the minds of many Palestinians. Guns often don't kill ideas but reinforce them. The future is messy and dangerous. The war in Gaza will not end neatly.",2023-12-09T09:48:23.000Z

France's Emmanuel Macron buffeted from all sides in row over secularismPublished9 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Emmanuel Macron has been accused of betraying the French Republic after he took part in a Jewish ceremony inside his official residence, the Elysée Palace. In a country where the separation of religion is itself a religion, the lighting of a Hanukkah candle inside the historic Salle des Fêtes on Thursday was immediately denounced by politicians of both right and left. The president had invited France's Chief Rabbi Haïm Korsia to light the first of eight candles on a Hanukkiah, or candelabra, marking the start of the Jewish festival of lights. The occasion was the award to President Macron of a prize for his efforts against antisemitism. But when video of the ceremony appeared shortly afterwards on social media, there was furore. For French opinion-formers of all stripes, the president had committed an enormousfaux-pasby allowing religion into the secular hallows of the presidency. ""As far as I know this is the first time this has ever happened. It is a breach of secularism,"" said David Lisnard, a prominent right-wing opposition figure who is also mayor of Cannes. ""The Elysée is not a place of religion. You cannot compromise with secularism,"" said the Socialist president of the Occitania region, Carole Delga. ""Will Macron now do the same for other religions? Some yes, some no? It's a dangerous spiral,"" said Alexis Corbière of the far-left France Unbowed. Even some French Jews were perplexed. ""This is something that shouldn't be allowed to happen again,"" said Yonathan Arfi who heads the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (Crif). ""French Jews have always considered secularism as a law of protection and of freedom. Anything that weakens secularism weakens Jews,"" he said. The idea of ""secularism"" was put into a French law of 1905, after years of struggle between the state and the Roman Catholic Church. It enshrined freedom of belief, but ended state involvement in the Church and removed all signs of religion from public buildings. The law has since come to be regarded as a cornerstone of modern France, ensuring strict neutrality between Christianity, Islam and Judaism, and guaranteeing that citizens are seen as individuals-in-a-state and not as members-in-a-community. For Emmanuel Macron to have breached a century-old Republican doctrine will be seen by critics as confirmation of his overweening self-belief and ""Jupiterian"" entitlement. Speaking on Friday as he viewed renovation work at Notre-Dame cathedral, the president said he had no regrets, and that his invitation to the chief rabbi had been made ""in the spirit of the Republic and of concord"". ""If the president had actually carried out a religious act, or taken part in a ceremony, that would indeed have been a breach of secularism. But that is not what happened,"" he said. The gesture comes at the end of a long political sequence over Gaza in which President Macron has been under attack for improvising policy on the hoof. Critics say he has failed to present a consistent line on the war, instead zigzagging from overclose proximity to the Israeli side at one moment, to intense courting of Arab opinion at the next: always with the aim of appeasing the large Jewish and Muslim populations in France. Shortly after 7 October, Mr Macron visited Israel and proposed an international coalition against Hamas, much like the one that defeated so-called Islamic State (IS). Accused of abandoning France's traditional backing for Palestinians, he then organised an international aid conference on Gaza to which Israel was not invited. He then further angered some Jews by refusing to attend a march against antisemitism, and in a BBC interview he spoke of""babies"" being bombedby the Israeli air force. Some have detected in this latest gesture at the Elysée a new, single-handed touch to the tiller of state. In France's foreign ministry, which has been largely sidelined by President Macron, off-the-record interviews make clear the frustration among professional diplomats. ""One day Macron is on the verge of announcing that he's going to help the Israeli army wipe out Gaza. Two weeks later he's on the BBC calling Israel a baby-killer,"" one former diplomat told Libération newspaper. ""OK, we know it is all about internal politics. But here, he's alienating first the Muslims, then the Jews.""",2023-12-09T06:51:06.000Z

Hamas claims Israeli operation ended in hostage deathPublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The armed wing of Hamas has released a video which it says shows the bloody aftermath of a failed Israeli operation to free an Israeli hostage. In the footage, a man says he has been held for 40 days, suggesting the video may have been recorded in mid-November. A lot of blood is seen on a tiled floor, as well as military equipment, which Hamas claims to have captured. The video ends with gruesome images of a bloodied body that appears to be that of the same hostage seen earlier. We are withholding the man's name - he says this and his age in the video. A script in Arabic says that Israeli soldiers ""failed to reach"" the hostage, leading to his death, and that the Israeli team ""quickly fled the place"". It claims that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) used an ambulance to reach the place where the hostage was being held. The BBC has not verified the video and has no confirmation of the claims made by Hamas in it. At a briefing on Friday evening, chief IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari confirmed that two Israeli soldiers were seriously wounded during operations in Gaza to free hostages. He said ""terrorists who participated in the kidnapping and holding of hostages"" had been killed, but he said no hostages had been released. It is not clear if he was talking about the same incident described in the Hamas video or something else. The IDF launched its military operation in Gaza after a deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October. Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage in the Hamas attack. A number of hostages were later released during a short-lived ceasefire - but not those who Hamas claims to be linked to the Israeli military. Hamas says Israel has killed more than 17,177 people in its retaliatory campaign, including about 7,000 children.",2023-12-08T22:08:08.000Z

Bowen: US uses veto but pressure for Gaza ceasefire is buildingPublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"UN secretary general António Guterres has spoken about the ""serious risk to the maintenance of international peace and security"" in the Gaza conflict, citing the spillover of hostilities in ""the occupied West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen"". He triggered Article 99, prompting a UN Security Council vote on Friday, because he believes this is a very urgent matter which must be brought to the attention of the council. The Israeli government detests the UN and they detest the secretary general. The Israelis rejected his description, claiming Mr Guterres is in fact the threat to world peace because he is pandering to Hamas by trying to end the fighting now, before their mission to destroy the group has been concluded. That ill-feeling will not have improved after the secretary general also mentioned that one of the risks is that the situation in Gaza could get so bad that there would be a mass displacement of Palestinians over the border into Egypt - which is also of huge concern to the Egyptian government. There was, Mr Guterres said, a high risk of the ""total collapse of the humanitarian support system in Gaza"". And the Palestinians say that is exactly what Israel wants because it wants to get all Palestinians out of Gaza. Journalists are not permitted by Israel to enter Gaza so I can't report from there myself, but what the secretary general is saying sounds pretty accurate from the pictures and video we can see and the people we speak to. By all the measures you can think of, the situation there for civilians is absolutely catastrophic, as they are subjected to a remorseless military campaign. Israel says they are doing what they can to save civilian lives but insists Hamas holds responsibility for using them as human shields. At the UN, the Americans duly vetoed this resolution calling for a ceasefire. For those concerned about the significant loss of life, that does sound a bit hollow - the Americans claim the Israelis are saying they will stick to the rules of war and avoid unnecessary civilian deaths. But, they say, there is a gap between what Israel says and what it does. I think the strategy behind the secretary general's decision to bring a vote - which he knew would probably get vetoed - was to hurry up the inevitable moment when the Americans will say to Israel: ""Enough is enough, you've had enough time and killed enough people and it's time for a ceasefire."" Some diplomats I have spoken to have said they might give the Israelis another month - I think Mr Guterres's strategy is to try and shorten that, partly by increasing international pressure and also partly by shaming the Americans into thinking that they cannot continue to hold this position as it becomes less and less tenable. That pressure has also increased today with the publication of footage of prisoners in Gaza, held by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), stripped to their underwear and being driven away in trucks. It's a cruel image of war seeing these men, which local reports on social media suggest could be as many as 700. Those same sources, including family of some of the men, say that they were taken from a UN school where they were sheltering, and where others tried to get away and were killed. A horrendous video circulated yesterday of six people lying dead in the street - said to be from that same area and near that same school - and one of them was a bloody corpse lying on top of a white flag he had apparently been carrying. The IDF say they are trying to work out who is a suspect and who is responsible for those terrible attacks on 7 October - and that they are all the while observing the international law on conflict. But for those who have little sympathy for what Israel is doing, or have lost sympathy because of the level of killing that has been carried out in Gaza, those people are saying that this is another sign of Israeli indifference to the dignity and the health of Palestinians. The weather is chilly here now, so being forced to walk around in underwear in streets, some blindfolded as we saw in the video, and some with their hands tied behind their back, is undoubtedly unpleasant. The Israelis say they can't avoid it - others say it's pretty savage.",2023-12-08T20:54:29.000Z

Claudine Gay: Harvard president sorry for remarks on antisemitismPublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Harvard's president has apologised for controversial remarks she made at a congressional hearing about antisemitism on US college campuses. When asked whether calls for the genocide of Jews constituted harassment under university policy, Dr Claudine Gay said it depended on the context. Dr Gay, and two other university presidents who gave similar answers, have since faced fierce criticism. ""I am sorry,"" she said in an interview with The Crimson student newspaper. ""Words matter. When words amplify distress and pain, I don't know how you could feel anything but regret,"" she added. Addressing the criticism inher interview with The Crimson, Dr Gay said she had ""got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures"". It is the second time Harvard's first black president has sought to clarify comments that have drawn national condemnation, including from the White House. Some have since called for her resignation. The Ivy League school is one of several in the US accused of failing to protect its Jewish students following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war two months ago. Jewish groups have reported an alarming rise in antisemitic incidents in the US since the conflict began. At Tuesday's hearing before the Republican-led House Education and Workforce Committee, Dr Gay - along with the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - was challenged on university policies and procedures to combat antisemitism. Near the end of the nearly six-hour hearing, New York Republican Elise Stefanik asked the three women: ""Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your university's] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment? Yes or no?"" Each witness evaded a direct answer, saying ""it depends on the context"". Dr Gay further added that Harvard only takes action when the speech ""crosses into conduct that amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation"". Ms Stefanik had previously asked about contentious phrases commonly used by some members of the Pro-Palestinian movement, which Dr Gay said she found personally ""abhorrent"". Dr Gay and the other college presidents also stated their support for Israel and opposition to antisemitism, but Dr Gay said her comments during the now viral exchange with Ms Stefanik were a mistake. ""What I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged,"" she said in her interview with the Harvard Crimson. Dr Gay and the other leaders' testimony has since sparked growing backlash both on and off campus. Harvard Hillel, a Jewish campus organisation, said in a statement on Tuesday that the testimony ""calls into question [Dr Gay's] ability to protect Jewish students on Harvard's campus"". And on Thursday, Rabbi David Wolpe - who had only weeks earlier joined a Harvard advisory group to combat antisemitism - resigned citing Dr Gay's ""painfully inadequate testimony"". Rabbi Wolpe told BBC Newshour that ""an ideology of wokeism and attendant antisemitism is deeply rooted"" in the culture of Harvard and other elite institutions. He noted that these colleges had spoken out against racism in recent years but retreated to ""transparently hypocritical"" defences of free speech on more contentious issues. Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and MIT now all face official congressional investigations on their efforts to address antisemitism. University of Pennsylvania President Elizabeth Magill is also facing a call to resign by an advisory board to the university's influential Wharton business school. A top donor at the school has vowed to withdraw a $100m donation because of her comments.",2023-12-08T20:35:27.000Z

Images show major damage to Gaza's oldest mosquePublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Footage has emerged showing extensive damage to Gaza's oldest mosque, with Hamas accusing the Israeli military for bombing the site. In the video, verified by the BBC, much of the Great Omari Mosque appears to be reduced to rubble, with only its minaret still intact. Hamas officials accused Israel of committing a ""heinous, barbaric crime"". The Israeli military has not commented. The mosque opened in the 7th Century on the site of a Byzantine church. Located in Gaza City's old town, the mosque was destroyed several times in various conflicts and once by an earthquake, but was rebuilt each time. It is named after Omar, Islam's second caliph. Gaza's Hamas-run antiquities ministry has accused Israel of bombing the enclave's historical and archaeological sites, urging the UN's cultural agency Unesco to help protect such sites. Israel has accused Hamas of using mosques, schools and other civilian infrastructure to hide its fighters. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched its military operation in Gaza after a deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October. Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage in the Hamas attack. A number of hostages were later released during a short-lived ceasefire. Hamas says Israel has killed more than 17,177 people in its retaliatory campaign, including about 7,000 children.",2023-12-08T19:38:28.000Z

Refaat Alareer: Palestinians mourn writer killed in air strikePublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Palestinians are mourning the death of well-known writer and literary scholar Refaat Alareer, who was killed in an air strike in Gaza City on Wednesday. Alareer's father-in-law said he had died along with his brother and sister and four of her children. He taught English literature at Gaza's Islamic University. ""My heart is broken, my friend and colleague Refaat Alareer was killed with his family,"" Gazan poet Mosab Abu Toha wrote on social media. Alareer had declined to leave northern Gaza following the start of Israeli operations in the area. Two days before he died he posted video to social media in which a number of explosions could be heard. ""The building is shaking. The debris and shrapnel are hitting the walls and flying in the streets,"" he wrote. In an interview with the BBC in the hours after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel, Alareer caused widespread offence by calling it ""legitimate and moral"". He said it was ""exactly like the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising"". The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was a revolt that took place in German-occupied Poland in 1943 and saw Jews use weapons smuggled into the ghetto to try to resist Nazi efforts to transport people to the extermination camps. Alareer was one of the founders of ""We Are Not Numbers"", a Palestinian non-profit set up in 2015 that joined writers from around the world with young people in Gaza to ""tell the stories behind the numbers of Palestinians in the news"". He was the co-editor of the book, Gaza Unsilenced, and the editor of Gaza Writes Back: Short Stories from Young Writers in Gaza, Palestine. Paying tribute on social media, former student Jehad Abusalim described Alareer as a mentor and friend who had ""truly cared about his students beyond the classroom"". Alareer, he added, taught him English and viewed the language as a ""way to break free from Gaza's prolonged siege, a teleportation device that defied Israel's fences and the intellectual, academic, and cultural blockade of Gaza"". He was ""full of energy, life & humour. He loved Chicago Pizza, cats, history, classic music, theatre, poetry & Harry Potter,"" said Muhammad Shehada, a Gazan writer and communications chief at Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor. He was described as ""one of the kindest, most generous, committed, wonderful human beings I ever met"", by Palestinian-American author and activist Susan Abulhawa in a video posted on social media. ""Rest in peace, Refaat Alareer. We will continue to be guided by your wisdom, now and forever,"" Palestinian-American author and journalist Ramzy Baroud wrote. In a poem posted on X, formerly Twitter, on 1 November, Alareer wrote: ""If I must die, let it bring hope, let it be a tale"". The post has been shared tens of thousands of times. Israel destroyed the Islamic University at which Alareer taught on 11 October, saying it was an ""important Hamas operational, political and military centre in Gaza"". Following the outcry over Alareer's interview in October, a BBC spokesperson said: ""We reported the Hamas attacks and the response by Israel in line with the BBC's Editorial Guidelines. ""We have included contributors who have condemned the attackers as terrorists and we have reported that Hamas is designated as a terrorist group by many Western governments, including the UK. ""While an interviewee who made comments on the Warsaw Ghetto was robustly challenged on air, we agree his comments were offensive and we don't intend to use him again."" In the 7 October attack, Hamas killed around 1,200 people and took 240 hostages, some of whom were released during a short-lived truce at the end of November. Hamas officials in Gaza say Israel has killed more than 17,177 people in its retaliatory campaign, including about 7,000 children. Update: An earlier version of this article described Refaat Alareer as controversial and has been amended to make clear that it was his comments about the 7 October attacks which were controversial and caused huge offence.",2023-12-08T19:19:45.000Z

Elizabeth Magill: UPenn loses $100m donation after House antisemitism testimonyPublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A major University of Pennsylvania donor has withdrawn a $100m (£79.3m) grant after a controversial appearance in Congress by the school's president. In an email seen by the BBC, Ross Stevens said he was ""appalled"" Elizabeth Magill avoided questions about how students calling for the genocide of Jews would be punished. Ms Magill was grilled by politicians on Tuesday about antisemitism on campus. She has since apologised for her remarks, but is facing calls to resign. US media are reporting the advisory board at Wharton - the university's business school - has written a letter to Ms Magill calling for her to step down ""with immediate effect"". American college campuses have seen angry protests and rising incidents of antisemitism since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted two months ago. Ms Magill appeared in the House of Representatives alongside the presidents of Harvard and MIT, Claudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth. They were asked by Republican New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik: ""Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your university's] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment? Yes or no?"" Ms Magill and her MIT and Harvard counterparts did not reply yes or no but said - in varying ways - that it depended on the ""context"". There has been a widespread backlash since, with the White House condemning the remarks. ""The lack of moral clarity is unacceptable,"" Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, the highest-ranking Jewish member of the administration, said on Thursday at a ceremony to mark the lighting of the national menorah. In his message about the withdrawal of the donation, Mr Stevens said: ""I have clear grounds to rescind Penn's $100 million of Stone Ridge shares due to the conduct of President Magill."" The founder and CEO of Stone Ridge Asset Management, he told the university that its ""permissive approach"" to those calling for violence against Jewish people ""would violate any policies or rules that prohibit harassment and discrimination based on religion, including those of Stone Ridge"". Penn is one of the oldest universities in the US and a part of the elite Ivy League group, which also has Harvard, Columbia and Yale as members. Wharton counts former US President Donald Trump, Tesla and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk, and many other powerful names in business and finance among its graduates. The donation, in the form of limited partnership units in Stone Ridge, was gifted by Mr Stevens in 2017 to help Wharton create a finance innovation centre. Ms Magill in particular has faced mounting scrutiny as to whether she can continue in her position. She released a video on the university's website on Wednesday apologising for her response during the hearing, saying that she was focused on the ""university's long-standing policies - aligned with the US Constitution - which say that speech alone is not punishable"". She added she should have been focused on the ""irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate"", adding that it is ""evil, plain and simple"". While her apology on Wednesday was welcomed by some, Mr Stevens' letter appeared to call for her resignation. He said Stone Ridge would welcome the opportunity to review its decision ""if, and when, there is a new University President in place"". On Wednesday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - a non-voting trustee at UPenn - criticised Ms Magill for her ""absolutely shameful"" remarks and called on the university to make a ""serious decision"" on her continued leadership. ""It should not be hard to condemn genocide,"" he said. ""Leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity, and Liz Magill failed to meet that simple test."" A petition demanding Ms Magill's resignation had gathered more than 23,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon. Facing criticism over her own remarks at Tuesday's hearing, Harvard President Dr Gay apologised in an interview with the college newspaper, saying she ""got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures"". The House Committee on Education and the Workforce announced on Thursday that they will formally investigate Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology over ""rampant antisemitism"". ""Committee members have deep concerns with their leadership and their failure to take steps to provide Jewish students the safe learning environment they are due under law,"" the committee's chairwoman Virginia Foxx said in a statement. Two University of Pennsylvania students - both of whom are Jewish - filed a lawsuit against the school on Thursday, claiming it has become ""an incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred, harassment and discrimination."" The lawsuit also accuses the school of ""selectively"" enforcing rules of conduct ""to avoid protecting Jewish students"" and hiring ""rabidly antisemitic professors who call for anti-Jewish violence"". Islamophobic attacks have also been on the rise on university campuses. The Department of Education has launched an investigation into multiple schools over alleged incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia.",2023-12-08T19:09:48.000Z

Video shows stripped Palestinian men detained in GazaPublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"With fighting raging around Khan Younis and in the north of Gaza, a video has emerged on social media showing dozens of Palestinian men detained by Israel. The footage, verified by the BBC, shows them stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground and being guarded by Israeli soldiers. The men are thought to have been arrested in Beit Lahia, in the far north of the Gaza strip. The BBC has been told some of the men have since been released. One of the men identified as having been detained is a well-known Palestinian journalist, leading his employers to accuse Israel of carrying out ""invasive searches and humiliating treatment"" of civilians. Asked about the video, a spokesman for the Israeli government told the BBC the men detained were all of military age and had been ""discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago"". In the video, dozens of men are lined up on a pavement and appear to have been told to remove their shoes, which are scattered across the road. Israeli soldiers and armoured vehicles are standing guard over them. Other images show them being transported in military trucks. In the Israeli media, the captives are being described as Hamas fighters who have surrendered. Another image -  which has not yet been verified by the BBC - shows men blindfolded, kneeling in what appears to be a large pit of bulldozed sand. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not directly commented on the images, but spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Thursday that ""IDF fighters and Shin Bet officers detained and interrogated hundreds of terror suspects"". ""Many of them also turned themselves in to our forces during the past 24 hours. The intelligence coming out of their interrogations is utilised to continue the fighting."" On Friday, Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told the BBC the men had been detained in Jabalia and Shejaiya in northern Gaza, which he described as ""Hamas strongholds and centres of gravity"". ""We're talking about military age men who were discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago,"" he said. Mr Levy added that they would be questioned to ""work out who indeed was a Hamas terrorist and who is not"". He emphasised the detained men had been found in areas where Israeli forces had engaged in ""close-quarter combat"" with Hamas. They had been ""deliberately disguising themselves as civilians"" and operating from civilian buildings. The BBC has spoken to a man who says 10 of his cousins were part of the group detained by the Israeli army on Thursday in Beit Lahia. The man - who wishes to remain anonymous over safety concerns - told BBC Arabic's Ethar Shalaby that IDF soldiers entered the area and used megaphones to order the men from their homes and UN relief agency (UNRWA) schools. The IDF ordered women in the area to go to a nearby hospital and later threated to shoot them if the men did not come out of their homes, he said. The man said seven of his cousins have since been released and have returned home, but added he does not know about the fate of the three who remain in Israeli detention. In a post on social media, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK described the footage as ""savage images of Israeli occupation forces detaining and stripping civilians taken from a UN shelter"". ""This evokes some of humanity's darkest passages of history,"" Husam Zomlot said. Palestinian journalist, Diaa al-Kahlout, a correspondent for al-Araby al-Jadeed, has been identified among those who were in the video of the detainees. The Arabic language news outlet, which also publishes in English under the name the New Arab, said Mr al-Kahlout had been arrested along with his brothers, relatives and ""other civilians"" by Israeli forces in Beit Lahia. Al-Araby al-Jadeed has condemned what it describes as the ""humiliating"" detention of Mr al-Kahlout on Thursday. It added that soldiers forced the men to remove their clothes and ""subjected them to invasive searches and humiliating treatment upon their arrest, prior to transporting them to undisclosed locations"". The outlet ""urges the international community, journalists' rights defenders and watchdogs, and human rights bodies to denounce this ongoing assault"" by Israel on journalists in the territory. A colleague of Mr al-Kahlout, Palestinian journalist Lamis Andoni, told Radio 4's PM programme on Friday that a number of prisoner had been released - but not Mr al-Kahlout. Ms Andoni said those freed told Mr Kahlout's family that he had been transferred to Zikim military base in Israel. The BBC has not verified this claim. ""We have no idea about his fate. The photos and videos of these men is horrifying. I'm shocked,"" she said, adding that her media outlet was liaising with Israeli forces via the UN.

Sheffield school probes staff member's Israel-Gaza commentsPublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Sheffield school is investigating ""ill-considered"" comments from a staff member about the Palestinians' role in the Israel-Gaza war. Astrea Academy said it had been ""very clear with our staff about the need for sensitivity concerning these events"". Tensions between supporters of Israel and Palestine have risen since the war began in October. The staff member ""will not be at school"" while the incident is investigated, the school said. They declined to confirm whether the person was a teacher and if they had been suspended following the incident on Wednesday. An Astrea Academy Trust spokesperson said: ""We recognise that the conflict draws a range of strongly held views and for this reason we have been very clear with our staff about the need for sensitivity concerning these events. ""The alleged incident falls short of the guidance we have given staff, and we understand that ill-considered words can unintentionally result in offence and distress."" They added: ""We wrote to families to make them aware of what had happened, our actions and to apologise for any offence caused. ""What happened does not reflect our values or our ethos at Astrea Academy Sheffield, where we work hard to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone in our school community."" Mark Jones, Labour councillor for Burngreave, said: ""I think the relationship between the school and the community is a bit strained, this won't help. ""At all times we would expect people to act respectfully and be mindful, not to be afraid of what they say, but to be cautious about causing offence. ""That's the difficulty at the moment, certainly with more heightened sensitivities."" South Yorkshire Police said they were not investigating the incident.

"Al-Mawasi: Gaza humanitarian zone not humane, evacuees sayPublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","As Israel presses its military offensive across Gaza, the army has been repeatedly advising some two million civilians to move to a ""humanitarian zone"" smaller than London's Heathrow Airport. Al-Mawasi is a narrow strip of land by the Mediterranean Sea. It has few buildings and largely consists of sandy dunes and agricultural land. The zone designated as safe by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), is just 8.5 sq km (3.3 sq miles). Reem Abd Rabu has spent the last few weeks sleeping on the ground and sharing a tent with four other families in the area. She is one of the 1.8 million Palestinians who have been displaced since the war began on 7 October after Hamas's attack on Israel. She first travelled to Khan Younis after fleeing northern Gaza, but after nearby houses were bombed, she said she felt she had to go to the place the Israeli army identified on the map as safe. Reem told the BBC al-Mawasi was an abandoned place, ""not a place for human beings"". She thought it would be safe from the intense bombardment and fighting, but when she arrived, she found little to no basic services. ""Water comes one day and not for the next 10 days, even in the bathrooms. And it's the same thing for electricity,"" she told the BBC. The IDF has urged civilians to move to al-Mawasi on at least 15 occasions on social media, the last on 2 December. The first mention of the humanitarian zone was on 18 October, when the IDF's Arabic spokesperson posted on X: ""The IDF orders Gaza residents to move to the humanitarian zone in the area of al-Mawasi, to which international humanitarian aid will be directed if necessary."" Another post, from 21 October, stated: ""If your life and the lives of those you love are important to you, head south of Wadi Gaza. We advise you to arrive at the humanitarian area in Mawasi according to our instructions."" Little to no internet connectivity has made it difficult for people to find safe areas in other parts of Gaza. However, even the IDF instructions on al-Mawasi have changed several times. Civilians say the changing messaging has made it difficult for them to know exactly where to find safety there too. Each IDF post has been accompanied by a map pinpointing a small area within al-Mawasi that Gazans should evacuate to. But different areas in al-Mawasi have been designated as ""humanitarian zones"" by Israel on different dates. On 18 October, the IDF designated the humanitarian zone marked in purple below. But three days later, the IDF declared a different area - shown in blue. Then, on 30 October, the area changed again - to the one marked in green. Mona al-Astal, who has also fled to al-Mawasi, says she is kept awake all night by the sound of shelling. She is a doctor who says she was forced to leave Khan Younis after her neighbour's home was bombed. Mona also describes a lack of water, electricity and supplies in the humanitarian zone. She said she had been forced to buy a tent and other supplies for $300 (£238). Mona said that she had seen people breaking into a UN agency storehouse because ""they were so hungry, they have nothing to eat"". To make matters worse, diseases including lice, chicken pox and intestinal infections have become widespread among children, she says. ""With every day that passes, the danger for us here increases,"" Mona added. Mohammed Ghanem fled from an area near al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza where he said more than 25 strikes occurred next to his house. He said he came to al-Mawasi because ""the Israeli army has been directing people here"" but said the area was ""neither humane nor safe"". He described seeing Israeli tanks less than a kilometre away and said there had been strikes on an area just 500 metres (1,640ft) from the humanitarian zone. The BBC has identified at least one area of damage approximately 500m away from the designated area of al-Mawasi since the IDF began directing people there. The BBC has contacted Israeli forces, but has not received a response. The IDF does claim that on 6 December Hamas ""launched a rocket from a humanitarian zone toward Israel"", and released a map with al-Mawasi marked. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. International agencies have been voicing concernsabout the viability of humanitarian zones in Gaza when fighting and air strikes extend across so much of the territory. In mid-November the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the plan for al-Mawasi was ""a recipe for disaster"". WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Attempting to cram so many people into such a small area with such little infrastructure or services will significantly increase risks to health for people who are already on the brink."" The United Nations also has wider concerns about the plan. ""The situation in Gaza is catastrophic; no one and no place is safe,"" Andrea de Domenico, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) told the BBC. ""Safe zones declared unilaterally cannot protect civilians"", he added. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",2023-12-08T14:44:48.000Z

Israel-Gaza: Burnley Council passes motion calling for ceasefirePublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A council has passed a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Burnley Council voted for the move to ""stop the mass killing of civilians in the Israel-Gaza conflict"". Aseven-day truce, which had seen humanitarian assistance reaching the Gaza Strip, ended on 1 December. Council leader Afrasiab Anwar said: ""This is not a Muslim issue. It is a humanitarian issue. Every single one of us needs to speak out."" Eleven councillors quit Labour over Sir Keir Starmer's decision not to push for a ceasefire in Gaza andformed a coalition with the Greens and Lib Demsin November. Burnley Council's motion to call for a ceasefire was proposed by councillor Lubna Khan and seconded by Green group leader Scott Cunliffe. The Conservative group abstained, while Labour councillors had a free vote, with some, including group leader Mark Townsend abstaining. Former council executive members Sue Graham and John Harbour voted against the motion. Hamas attacked Israel in October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages, some of whom were released during a short-lived truce. Hamas officials in Gaza said Israel has killed more than 17,000 people in its retaliatory campaign, including about 7,000 children. The council motion also called for the opening of aid corridors into Gaza, the United Nations and International Criminal Court appointing arbitrators to assess evidence of war crimes and the establishment of a recognised and sovereign Palestine alongside a secure and sovereign Israel. Former councillor Bea Foster, who was on a Burnley Women for Peace pilgrimage to the Holy Land when the conflict broke out, told the meeting before the debate: ""To challenge the Israeli government on the issue of the illegal occupation is not anti-Semitic."" Councillor Shah Hussain said: ""Everyone has seen footage of what can only be described as genocide and wiping out a particular race of people. ""There are extremists on both sides. When we call out Hamas, and rightly so, we need to call out the Israeli terrorists who are killing Christians and Muslims on the West Bank,"" he added. Councillor Gordon Lishman said he believed there was an ""unspoken alliance between Hamas and [Israel's Prime Minister] Benjamin Netanyahu"" because both of them ""have an interest in maintaining conflict"". Labour member Gail Barton questioned the motion's wording asking the government to ""guarantee"" the prompt opening of aid corridors into Gaza. She said: ""As a British government we have no power to do that whatsoever. Words are important."" Ms Khan responded: ""I don't think any of these people would forgive us for being pedantic about a word. ""These are real people. Nobody will silence us on this. Every human life matters.""

Israel-Gaza: London couple traumatised after fleeing West BankPublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A couple who got trapped in the West Bank as the Israel-Gaza conflict broke out say they are traumatised and afraid for their relatives who remain there. Palestinians Imad Alqasim and Zeina Ramadan, who live in London, said it took days to leave with their child. The husband and wife say they have struggled to eat and sleep since returning to the capital. Ms Ramadan also said she was ""living in a nightmare"" and felt ""guilt for being able to leave"". Mr Alqasim and Ms Ramadan were visiting extended family in Nablus and then travelled to Ramallah in the central west Bank. The couple were looking forward to visiting Bethlehem and Jerusalem but all this changed when news reached them that Hamas had launched an attack on Israel on 7 October. Mr Alqasim said ""people started being a bit terrified"" and taxi drivers advised them not to travel because ""it was not safe"", so they cancelled their trip to Bethlehem and remained in Ramallah hoping things would improve. Instead the situation became worse. ""I didn't leave the home at all and someone came and brought food to the place we were in because we couldn't actually move."" Mr Alqasim and Ms Ramadan decided to cancel their other trips and ""leave as quick as possible"" once the border reopened. However, the couple realised Ms Ramadan could not return to London initially as she is a Palestinian citizen unlike Mr Alqasim, who has British citizenship. He said it was ""a hard decision"" to leave his wife and child behind, something he later regretted. ""I thought if I was outside I could be a little bit more helpful in trying to get her out,"" said Imad. Ms Ramadan said although she grew up in the area and was familiar with it, having her baby daughter with her made her feel more vulnerable. ""No-one knew if the road was safe, [my husband] was asking the driver if that road was safe and he was saying 'we don't know - we don't know if the road is open, we don't know if the road is safe',"" she said. Mr Alqasim managed to cross the border to Amman in Jordan, while Ms Ramadan returned to Nablus, which she said was under siege and officially announced as a closed area by the Israeli army. When she and their daughter finally made it to Amman two days later they flew back to the UK, arriving in London on 13 October but their ordeal is still continuing as they process being apart from their relatives in the West Bank. ""It was the hardest thing I've ever been through, Ms Ramadan said, adding: ""We weren't eating properly, we weren't sleeping properly."" ""Part of my brain was trying to function - what happened, how we were separated for a while as a family, how I made a decision to leave. ""I felt guilty for being able to leave... I still feel this guilt."" She continued: ""Seeing people in the streets; of course they're living their normal lives but something shifted in my head. ""It makes you feel unreal, it makes you feel like, 'I'm living in a nightmare, this is not real'. Even though almost every generation of her family have lived through periods of conflict and the trio are physically safe in London, Zeina said she doesn't ""feel safe"". ""When you start your day you need some time to try to understand that you're not there and there's nothing you can do about it except to move on with your life."" ""There is a collective grief, but we don't even have time to grieve. It doesn't stop,"" she explained. ""There are some moments where you break down with even minor things. There's a lot of talk about post-traumatic [stress] but there is no post, there is no post... because that has been my whole life,"" she said through tears. ""I just want things to be over and then we can think about grief,"" Ms Ramadan said. ""I need to be strong for [my daughter]."" Additional reporting by Alice Bhandhukravi.

'We can't stop' - the Israeli woman still helping sick PalestiniansPublished8 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Yael Noy doesn't wear military fatigues, but she describes herself as being in battle right now, after the Hamas assault on 7 October. ""I'm fighting to be good,"" she tells me. ""I'm fighting to stay moral when both sides are in such terrible pain. I'm fighting to be the same person I was before."" Yael heads a charity called Road to Recovery, a group of Israeli volunteers who drive sick Palestinians - mostly children - from checkpoints in the occupied West Bank and Gaza to hospital appointments in Israel. Or did. The 1,000 or so volunteers can no longer take patients from Gaza, which is governed by Hamas. And four of them are dead - murdered as Palestinian gunmen stormed through their kibbutzim in southern Israel. They include Vivian Silver, a renowned peace activist; Adi Dagan, who Yael describes as ""funny"" and always ready to step in and ferry patients at short notice in his big car; Tammy Suchman, a much-loved grandmother; and Eli Or-Gad, who loved talking about poetry. Four other volunteers lost close family members on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 17,177 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive which followed. Yael lives in northern Israel, but her parents are from kibbutz Alumim, one of the southern communities which was attacked - and they cowered as the assault unfolded, hour after terrifying hour. Two of her nephews have been fighting in Gaza, in Israel's military response. In the immediate aftermath of 7 October, Yael says she was so shaken that she could barely breathe. ""Something was broken in my heart and I said that I would never talk to people in Gaza again,"" she tells me. But after a few days, she decided that she couldn't allow the atrocities to change her. She and most of the Road to Recovery volunteers have continued to drive Palestinians from the West Bank to hospitals in Israel for cancer treatment, organ transplants and kidney dialysis. As soon as she can, she says she'll go and collect patients from Gaza again. Yael refuses to dehumanise them, or equate them with Hamas, which is classed as a terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries. ""Like us they are victims of Hamas, so I think we should keep on helping them, because it's not their fault,"" she tells me over the phone. ""We can't refuse to help a child with cancer. Our neighbours need help, so we need to help them."" She worries for the families she knows in Gaza, with winter approaching and so many bombed houses now uninhabitable. The parent of a 6-year-old child, who'd had an organ transplant, texted one of the Road to Recovery volunteers saying simply: ""We are okay. We are going to die here."" Yael is also desperately concerned for two Road to Recovery volunteers, Oded Lifschitz and Chaim Peri, who are still being held hostage by Hamas. Emotionally, she feels like she's being torn apart. She has uncles and cousins who are adamantly opposed to what she's doing and accuse her of helping Hamas. And it's not just family members who disapprove. ""When I'm driving with Palestinians through checkpoints in the West Bank, soldiers have asked me how I can do what I'm doing,"" she tells me. ""Other people ask the same question."" ""It's dangerous now to even talk about the suffering of the kids in Gaza - people look at me like I'm the enemy,"" she says, through sobs. ""But I'm not doing it for the Palestinians, I'm doing it because I want to be proud to be Israeli. I believe that whether you're an Israeli or a Palestinian, a Jew or an Arab, people are people."" Some Palestinian families have reached out to find out how she is. But it's harder than ever now for those few people swimming against the tide by trying to bridge the divide between Israelis and Palestinians. ""Even people on the left say that we should flatten Gaza. Both sides have become more and more radicalised,"" Yael says. ""I really don't know what will happen in the future. But I know that both of us will still live here, so we must find a solution."" Since 7 October, some Road to Recovery volunteers have dropped out of driving altogether or decided to focus on taking medicines to displaced Israelis instead, while the war lasts. But other volunteers have stepped in, to make sure that sick Palestinians from the West Bank still get to appointments that are saving their lives. Yael says the charity will need support from the outside world to keep going because donations from within Israel have virtually stopped. But she is sure that, when it becomes possible, Road to Recovery will be collecting child patients from Gaza again - hoping that they will all have survived. ""It may be hard.  But we can't stop,"" she says. ""It's my mission and I have to do it.""",2023-12-08T05:01:29.000Z

Hanukkah more pertinent than ever before - Union of Jewish StudentsPublished7 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The story of Hanukkah will be ""more pertinent than ever before"" this year, the president of the Union of Jewish Students has said. Edward Isaacs said the union was asking students to light an extra candelabra used on the festival for Jewish people still beingheld in captivity by Hamas. Hanukkah, or the Festival of Lights, runs from 7 to 15 December this year. Events will be held in London, including in Golders Green and Trafalgar Square, to mark the festival. Mr Isaacs said: ""We have facilitated a hostage campaign, themed around Hanukkah, with every other youth movement within the British Jewish community. ""We are quite literally distributing thousands of Hanukkah candles, all of which come with a picture of a hostage on them, with the slogan, 'We light for those who can't', and hashtag 'Bring them home now'. Hanukkah or Chanukah is the Jewish Festival of Lights. It dates back to two centuries before the beginning of Christianity. The festival begins on the 25th day of Kislev, a month which occurs in November and December on the Gregorian calendar, and is celebrated for eight days. In the western calendar Hanukkah is celebrated in November or December. The word Hanukkah means rededication and commemorates the Jews' struggle for religious freedom. ""While it is normally a joyous time, I think the focus on Jewish pride and resistance will still be there,"" said the 21-year-old, who is based in London. He added that Jewish students across the country were dealing with an ""unprecedented rise of antisemitism on campus"" and urged people to recognise it and call it out. Gary Mond, chairman of the National Jewish Assembly, said it was ""hard to say"" how many people would attend public events as the Gaza war continues. Mr Mond said the ""traditions of Hanukkah will continue to be observed"" but ""many Jews in this country are very fearful at the moment"". ""A lot of Jews feel very much alone in that they don't believe that they have had a lot of support from non-Jews and that they are facing higher levels of antisemitism than ever before,"" the 64-year-old said. ""I know that some of the chabads are organising celebrations and public menorah lightings,"" he said. ""It will be interesting to see how well attended they are."" Reflecting on his own plans, he said: ""I think we'll probably go to theGolders Green chabadat least once during Hanukkah, maybe twice. ""The National Jewish Assembly is organising a Hanukkah party in the House of Lords and around 150 of our members and guests are coming."" In Trafalgar Square, a giant menorah will be on display for a week from Thursday, with one of the lights lit at 16:00 GMT each day apart from on Saturday, when the lighting will be at 17:15. Speaking at the event, Rabbi Yossi Simon from Chabad Golders Green said: ""Hanukkah is all about light overpowering the darkness... one little candle can dispel a lot of darkness."" He said lighting more candles each day reminds Jews to focus on ""increasing positive energy"", for example by ""uplifting someone"" or giving a smile. He added with current world events, this year ""there is an incredible effort"" going into Hanukkah celebrations including ""giant menorahs going up throughout the United Kingdom and across the world"" because ""people around the world are getting depressed, are feeling low, and we can uplift people"".

Israel war cabinet minister's son killed in Gaza fightingPublished7 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The son of Israel's ex-army chief Gadi Eisenkot, who is currently a minister in the country's war cabinet, has been killed in Gaza, the military says. It says 25-year-old Master Sergeant Gal Eisenkot died in northern Gaza on Thursday. Israeli media say MSgt Eisenkot was badly injured after a tunnel shaft exploded and later died in hospital. PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife were ""broken-hearted"", and that Gal Eisenkot was a ""true hero"". In his statement, Mr Netanyahu added: ""Our heroes have not fallen in vain. We will continue to fight until victory."" Gadi Eisenkot, 63, is a battle-hardened retired general who served as Israel's chief of the general staff from 2015-19. A lawmaker from the National Unity party, he is also a current member of Mr Netanyahu's emergency government set up after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. Israel has responded by bombarding Gaza from the air and launching a ground invasion. Hamas officials in Gaza say it has killed more than 17,000 people, mainly civilians, with thousands more missing under rubble. Mr Eisenkot was informed about his son's injuries as he was visiting the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) Southern Command, local media reported. A number of Israeli government officials and lawmakers also sent their condolences to the Eisenkot family. Opposition leader Yair Lapid posteda photo of Gal and Gadi Eisenkotin military uniforms hugging each other. ""This photo. This hug. A father and his son. Both in uniform. Both soldiers in this country,"" Mr Lapid wrote. ""They both respond to the call and show up when they're needed, doing whatever they need to do. The fate of an entire nation in one hug."" The IDF also said that another soldier - named as Sgt Maj Jonathan David Deitch, 34 - was killed in southern Gaza on Thursday.",2023-12-07T19:16:59.000Z

Gaza protesters block BAE Systems shipyard in GlasgowPublished7 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Campaigners have staged a blockade at the BAE Systems shipyard in Glasgow in opposition to its ties to Israel. The protest at the entrances to the defence firm's site in Govan has been organised by a local group alongside Workers for a Free Palestine. The campaign group said it had also blockaded defence factories inDorset,BrightonandLancashire. It is urging BAE Systems to end ties with Israel and cease all weapons, defence and supplies trading. Protesters with Palestinian flags also said they wanted the UK Government to back a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. BAE Systems said it respects ""everyone's right to protest peacefully"". Workers for a Free Palestine said BAE Systems produces components of weapons sold to Israel - including the F35 combat aircraft and the Mk 38 Mod 2 machine gun. The activists blocked one entrance to the BAE site with a large banner stating ""Stop Arming Israel"". Police Scotland officers were in attendance at the demonstration. Protester Bint Sanna, who did not want to give her real name, told BBC Scotland News the group wanted to ""put a stop to UK government support for Israel"". She added: ""They are supporting them to commit genocide to kill thousands of innocent children, thousands of innocent women and men and destroying homes."" Another campaigner, Hex, said he travelled from Edinburgh to attend after a call to action from Palestinian trade unions. He said: ""While we can shut down this door and we can prevent the factory from running for a day, it's really the guys in there that have the real power."" Protester Oli said the group was not targeting yard workers with the action. He added: ""We're here to blame the managers who decide to produce and sell arms to Israel."" The Glasgow protest was part of co-ordinated action to blockade four arms factories around the UK. The biggest was at Eaton Mission Systems in Wimborne near Bournemouth where around 600 people took part. A BAE Systems spokesperson said: ""We're horrified by the situation in Israel and Gaza and the devastating impact it's having on civilians in the region and we hope it can be resolved as soon as possible. ""We operate under the tightest regulation and comply fully with all applicable defence export controls, which are subject to ongoing assessment."" Earlier this week BAE systems announced that it was creating 300 new jobs in Glasgow for the construction of new warships.

Ukraine aid from US in doubt after failed Senate votePublished7 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsWar in Ukraine,"Senate Republicans have blocked a move to pass an aid bill for Ukraine after failing to secure border compromises they sought in exchange. The $110bn (£87.3bn) package included $61bn for Ukraine, as well as funds for Israel and aid for Gaza. The White House has warned that US funds for Ukraine could soon run out. A Ukrainian official said that failure to secure more US aid would mean a ""very high possibility"" that the war will be lost to Russia. While Republican members are generally in favour of aid to Ukraine, some have sought to use the issue as a way to address mounting domestic concerns over the US southern border. Senators - including every single Republican - voted 51 to 49 against advancing the bill, with 60 votes needed. The vote throws uncertainty into the future of aid for Ukraine and sends lawmakers back to the negotiating table just days before Congress has scheduled its winter break. Republicans are insisting that any aid to Ukraine be tied to sweeping US immigration and asylum reforms. Earlier on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said he was ""willing to make significant compromises on the border"" in order to get the aid bill passed. ""This cannot wait,"" he said, adding that ""Republicans in Congress are willing to give Putin the greatest gift he could hope for"". Also on Wednesday, the Biden administration announced $175m in new security assistance for Ukraine from the supply of funding that has already been approved. The package includes ammunition, including missiles and artillery shells, as well as ""equipment to protect critical national infrastructure"", the US Department of Defense said in a news release. Concerns over the future of the $110bn package grew on Tuesday after a classified briefing for lawmakers aimed at shoring up support for new funds broke down spectacularly. Senators shouted at each other over border security and at least a dozen Republicans walked out. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also cancelled a virtual briefing with lawmakers over a ""last-minute matter"", Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday, without providing further detail. The package already includes provisions for border security, but Republican demands for additional changes to asylum rules has complicated negotiations with Democrats. Ahead of the failed vote to bring the package to the floor, Mr Schumer delivered an emotional plea to his colleagues on the Senate floor, telling them that the vote was an important ""moment in history"" and that they should ""rush to the defence of democracy"" in Ukraine. ""You can be sure that Vladimir Putin is watching closely,"" he said. On Tuesday, the head of Ukraine's presidential office, Andriy Yermak, told an audience at the US Institute of Peace that a failure to secure more US aid would mean a ""very high possibility"" that the war will be lost and that it will be ""impossible to continue to liberate"" Russian-held areas. In Ukraine, dimming prospects for additional aid have led to a darkening mood among some parts of the population. ""Of course we need support, we are protecting the whole of Europe,"" Tetyana, a Kyiv resident whose son is on the frontline, told the BBC this week. ""We need more weapons because our children are dying."" The Senate bill needed nine Republican votes to advance - a threshold that was ultimately too high. Some Democrats expressed frustration at their Republican colleagues. ""The Ukrainians are on the frontlines fighting for democracy,"" Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren told reporters. ""This is about freedom"". Several Senators said that while more negotiations would follow, it is unclear whether any progress can be achieved before Congress breaks for the holidays next week. Mr Schumer, for his part, said ""we'll see"" when asked whether he believed Senators could come to an agreement before the break, even though he believed Mr Biden had presented a ""good strong plan"". One of the Republicans who opposed the package, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, said he did not believe any solution would be possible in that timeframe. Mr Graham added that he believed Mr Biden would ultimately need to negotiate more, saying that ""it's going to take his leadership or we are stuck."" ""They know what we want,"" he said. ""I'm hopeful we can get the border part in a place where we can go for a bill."" Even if it had passed in the Senate, the package still would have faced an uphill battle in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Tuesday that he has told the Senate he cannot pass any Ukraine aid without the inclusion of significant border security measures. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Congress has approved over $110bn in military and economic aid to Ukraine, most of which has already been distributed. In a letter to Mr Johnson released publicly earlier this week, White House budget director Shalanda Young said that the US would be unable to get more weapons and equipment to Ukraine ""by the end of the year"" without Congressional action. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly stressed that they see US aid as vital to the ability of the country's forces to resist the Russians and re-take occupied territory. Another senator to vote against the aid bill was independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who had earlier in the day expressed reservations that the legislation included billions in military aid for Israel. ""I do not believe we should be appropriating over $10 billion for the right-wing extremist Netanyahu government to continue its current military approach,"" Mr Sanders said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ongoing campaign in the Gaza strip, which has so far killed thousands of civilians. Mr Sanders, who is a long-time critic of Mr Netanyahu, added: ""What the Netanyahu government is doing is immoral, it is in violation of international law, and the United States should not be complicit in those actions.""

Bringing broken survivors of the Israel Nova festival attack back from darknessPublished7 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"""You can cry here,"" the sign reads in pale blue lettering on a clean white background. Beyond it, comfortable sofas piled with cushions are screened off from the rest of the room. It's a safe, private corner where survivors of the Nova music festival can be with others who went through the same ordeal on 7 October, and get the mental health support many of them desperately need. More than 360 young partygoers were shot, beaten or burnt to death by Hamas attackers, who stormed the festival site near the Israel-Gaza perimeter fence early that morning. Another 40 were taken hostage. First, social media posts showed panicked crowds fleeing from rockets fired from Gaza and gunmen on the ground. Later, distressing videos from first responders began to confirm the scale of the massacre, as they filmed scores of murdered partygoers. In the following days, Dr Lia Naor realised that - unlike those who'd been evacuated from their nearby kibbutzim - the young people from the festival who lived through the ordeal didn't have a community already around them to give support. So she built one. ""I just wanted them to be held,"" Dr Naor explains. ""They were so fragmented and so frozen. Then there was the brokenness of faith that they that had felt - there'd been nobody there for them, not their parents, not the army, not the police. Nobody was there to save them. So the first thing was just getting them to feel secure and in a healing space."" The outdoor setting in Rishpon, north of Tel Aviv, is sheltered and peaceful. The early December days have been warm in Israel, and people sit on colourful beanbags scattered across the grass. A timetable is propped up showing the range of workshops that day, from mosaic making to sound baths. There's massage, group music, and singing sessions. A few placid dogs roam through the group, waiting to be stroked or begging for food. One tiny, black-haired crossbreed chihuahua has a pair of silver wings on its back, drawing coos of appreciation. It's a different scene from the early days. ""Even though their bodies were whole, we saw how broken they were and that their eyes were hollow,"" Lia remembers. ""They didn't look alive. They couldn't look at us. They would shake, they couldn't eat, they couldn't drink. The evil that these people met is incomprehensible. ""I told them early on, 'As dark the darkness is that you saw, we're going to bring the light. We're going to help you believe in yourselves and in others again.'"" This place is a huge collective effort, but it hasn't been driven by the state. Everybody here is a volunteer giving their time for free and hoping to heal themselves too. The homemade food spread out on low tables is donated by charities and businesses. Everyone wants to do something to help in the aftermath of one of Israel's darkest moments. Lior Gelbaum is a Nova survivor. I compliment her on the tiny jewels she's stuck under each eye, sparkling in the light, and she tells me they make her feel festive again. The 24-year-old from the city of Petah Tikva is coming here regularly to get support and give out handmade silver necklaces to others who were there that day. She remembers it well. ""At 06:30 in the morning, we started hearing rockets flying above our heads,"" she tells me. ""We know the drill, so we got into our car and started driving away, but there was a traffic jam. We started hearing gunshots above our heads, so we got out and just started running towards the open field. We didn't know where we were going or what was happening, we just heard automatic gunshots all around us. Two people, Yehuda and Galit, had a big car and got us inside it and away. They saved us."" Lior also talks about the importance of music to her healing process. ""Everyone that was at the Nova festival, we love to dance, we love to be together. After the massacre happened, it was important for the community to get back together and to strengthen each other, to be with each other and talk and feel our emotions."" But she says she's been struggling to enjoy something which is a huge part of her identity. ""It's been hard for me to listen to music since the Nova festival, and still I only feel comfortable listening to music at concerts with the artists that come to this place,"" Lia says. Above the seating area, a huge garden stretches up a low hill. It's framed with trees laden with citrus fruits and row after row of bushy herbs, the rosemary and sage scenting the air. The survivors often walk through it and pick the leaves to turn into herbal teas. Nature is a big part of this place. The need for space is so great that new rustic tents are being built to make room for the hundreds of people who are now coming here. Each day, professional clinical psychologists mix with the survivors who arrive. They're there to talk as much or as little as needed. Dr Itamar Cohen is one of them. He flew in from London as soon as he could after 7 October. I ask about the stories he's heard. He breathes deeply, then answers. ""People here have seen a tremendous amount of pain. Some of them were extremely close to not being here any more. Some were chased and had to run for their lives. There wasn't much time to process that, just running away from a massacre. And now they still need to function, and they still need to go and push through."" There's another element too. ""A lot of people are experiencing some sort of grief, they lost tens of their friends at one time. And there's guilt. 'Why am I the one who survived and not my friend? I should have picked up more survivors inside my car to drive them to safety.' So a lot of thoughts around, 'I am not really worthy of being saved and I could have done better.'"" Dr Cohen tells me that being around other therapists at a dark time helps them all. ""We have time to see together, to process and to speak about the challenges and our vulnerabilities, and our fears and sense of guilt. It means we have a space to work that through and to strengthen each other, and it helps me as well, tremendously.""

Putin makes rare foreign trip to Gulf statesPublished7 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsWar in Ukraine,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a rare trip abroad to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. Expected discussion topics included the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as oil production, with the UAE president. The UAE is currently hosting the COP28 UN climate summit. Mr Putin, who has barely left Russia since March when the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued him an arrest warrant, will also see Iran's leader on Thursday in Moscow. The ICC has accused him of illegally deporting Ukrainian children to Russia - a war crime - but neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia recognise the court's jurisdiction. The Russian leader has snubbed other recent international summits including Brics in South Africa in August and the G20 summit in September in India. The trips come as Russia is keen to project influence and undermine the West's attempts to isolate it. Mr Putin was greeted in the UAE with a full cavalry escort and motorcade while a national aerobatics team drew the Russian flag in the sky with smoke trails. Russia's leader told UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan that ""our relations have reached unprecedented levels"". Trade and oil will be on the agenda in the UAE, which a Kremlin statement said is ""Russia's main economic partner in the Arab world"". The Russian president later travelled to Saudi Arabia to meet the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. During a brief televised sitdown chat Mr Putin invited the crown prince to visit Moscow. ""Nothing can prevent the development of our friendly relations,"" he said, adding that it was important ""to exchange information and assessments"" on current regional events. The crown prince said bilateral co-operation had ""helped remove many tensions in the Middle East"". The controversial leader of Russia's Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, was also spotted attending the meeting between Mr Putin and the de facto ruler of the Gulf state. Ahead of the meeting the Kremlin reported that the two leaders would ""consider ways to promote de-escalation"" in the conflict between Israel and Hamas and that conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Sudan would be discussed in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Russian news agency Tass also reported that Russian government spokesman,  Dmitry Peskov, had confirmed that Mr Putin and the crown prince had discussed Opec+ cooperation. Kremlin officials have announced that Mr Putin will meet Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi on Thursday to discuss the war in Gaza.",2023-12-07T00:49:28.000Z

BBC reporter in Gaza: People here are traumatised and exhaustedPublished6 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Young men in jeans and flip-flops stand in line in front of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, as if they are watching a funeral procession. It's another night in the tense gloom outside the accident and emergency department. Medical personnel in scrubs are poised to receive more casualties. Voices are raised and men crowd around. Public order is starting to break down - people are traumatised and exhausted. A car pulls up, its horn blaring and lights flashing. A young man is pulled out and put onto a stretcher, then rushed inside. Then another car arrives, covered in dust, and a child who is only four or five is helped out. He is able to walk. Hospitals in Khan Younis - the Gaza Strip's second largest city - have been overwhelmed since the Israeli air force intensified its bombardment of the south on Friday. Israeli tanks and troops have also now entered the city, after the ground offensive was widened following the collapse of a temporary truce with Hamas. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 1,200 people have been killed across the territory since the fighting resumed. That has brought to more than 16,000 the total number killed in Gaza during the war, which was triggered by Hamas's attacks on southern Israel on 7 October. Gunmen from Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in Israel, the UK, US and EU - killed at least 1,200 people and took more than 240 back to Gaza as hostages. Many of Gaza's 2.3 million residents sought refuge in the south after the Israeli military ordered civilians to leave the north in the early days of the war. But with the fighting spreading to Khan Younis, they're running out of places to flee to. Thousands of displaced people are crammed inside the grounds and corridors of the city's European Hospital. ""When we are playing and there is bombardment, we immediately run to the tents near the walls and [pretend to be] asleep,"" says one of the children there as the sounds of explosions fill the air. ""We are afraid. The glass of windows shatters above us."" A woman at the hospital says she fled to al-Fakhari, an area east of Khan Younis, after receiving phone calls telling them that it was a ""safe zone"". But now, she says, the area is being bombarded and the situation is ""very bad"". ""I don't see any area being safe when it comes to us, nor is any area habitable."" A 75-year-old man agrees that nowhere is safe. ""The situation is indescribable. There are children and women. We, as elderly, can withstand what is happening,"" he says. ""Listen to the ongoing sounds - how could someone sit and wait for the opportunity to leave a safe zone? Where is the safety? We can't sense it. Every place we go to, they say it is safe but we can't find that."" In downtown Khan Younis, Samah Ilwan waves two empty water bottles in the air and says her six children - five girls and one boy - are thirsty. ""We have become like cats and dogs. Perhaps cats and dogs get shelters. We don't have any. We're stranded in the street."" Life is also closing in on me. Despite everything that has happened to me and my family since the start of the war, this is the first time that I feel completely lost. All willpower and control have been ripped from me. I'm used to keeping my family safe and secure, coming up with a plan. Now, I am torn by indecision. I'm originally from the north but I fled south with my family after being ordered to do so by the Israeli army, who said the south was ""safe"". Currently, I am alone in Khan Younis, while my family is in central Gaza. I was able to travel up to see them every few days. But now, the Israelis have shut one road and the second one is very dangerous. Should I go south to Rafah, keep working and hope that my family will be ok? Or should I try to get back to them, stop reporting, and if it comes to the worst, then at least we die together? I hope no-one else ever has to face this awful choice, which is not a choice at all.",2023-12-06T19:28:01.000Z

"Israel hostages in Gaza: We have evidence their health worsening, say familiesPublished6 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Families of people being held captive in Gaza say they have ""solid intelligence"" that the health of several hostages has deteriorated. Some are ""now in immediate danger"", the group of hostages' families said in a letter to Israel's war cabinet. Pressure has been growing on officials over the 138 people still being held by Hamas and other armed groups. Some of the freed hostages met Israel's leaders on Tuesday in a meeting that witnesses say turned rowdy. Israel has repeatedly pledged to do everything it can to rescue the remaining hostages. Some 110 hostageshave been released in total- but a week-long truce under which dozens were freed ended last week and since then Israel has resumed its bombing of Gaza. In a letter sent to the war cabinet, the Hostages Families HQ group said: ""We have received solid intelligence that there are abductees whose condition has deteriorated and are now in immediate danger."" They said at least one-third of the hostages were suffering from underlying illnesses and needed regular medical treatment - and going without such treatment was dangerous. Many abductees were also suffering from injuries from the 7 October attack - such as gunshot wounds or amputations - while some were tortured and abused, the group added. ""Based on this data, we demand that you act urgently, with initiative and creativity to obtain a deal for the immediate release of all the abductees - for them every additional day in captivity is a real danger to their lives,"" it said. It is thought the evidence they cite has come from the newly-released hostages, who on Tuesday evening held a meeting with Israel's prime minister and war cabinet and described what they saw during their captivity. Observers say the meeting turned tense and disorganised - with some accusing the government of putting politics before the wellbeing of their loved-ones. According to Israeli newspaper Haaretz,one former hostage - Israeli nurse Nili Margalit - told the meeting she had been looking after some of the elderly people being held captive, and that they suffered from heart disease, kidney failure and Parkinson's. ""They lie on mattresses all day long. I don't know how they manage since I left,"" she said. Another former hostage said she was scared by the bombing in Gaza, Haaretz reported. ""I see [Israeli] bombings there, and you have no idea where the captives are. I was in a house surrounded by explosions. We slept in tunnels, and we feared not Hamas, but Israel might kill us, and then it would have been said, 'Hamas killed you,'"" she said. In an audio recording from the meeting, obtainedby Israeli news site Ynet,another unnamed former hostage whose husband is still in captivity said she saw an 85-year-old Israeli man killed. ""I saw Aryeh Zalmanovich die in front of me,"" she said. ""And is that what you have to say, that you want to bring down the Hamas regime? That you want to show them who has bigger balls?"" Applause could be heard in the auditorium at the woman's outburst. In the recording, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can be heard telling the families that there was ""no possibility right now of bringing everyone home"". Haaretz also quoted Mr Netanyahu as saying:""We couldn't bring them all at once. If we could have done it, we would have."" He said that the reports of hostages' hearing Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bombings while in captivity ""pierces the heart. It not only pierces the heart, but as you'll surely understand, it also affects our operational considerations"". And he repeated Israel's pledge to rescue all hostages, saying: ""Our responsibility is to bring them all back. We'll fulfil this responsibility and bring them home."" IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari repeated the pledge, saying: ""As the IDF expands its operations to dismantle Hamas in Gaza, we have not lost sight, not for one moment, of our critical mission to rescue our hostages, to do everything in our power to bring our hostages home.""",2023-12-06T16:18:37.000Z

How missiles from Yemen could escalate Israel-Gaza warPublished6 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"It is well over 1,000 miles from the coast of Yemen to the Gaza Strip, and yet what happened last Sunday at the southern end of the Red Sea has the potential to dramatically escalate the war between Israel and Hamas. According to US Central Command, the division of the US Department of Defence that covers the Middle East, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen carried out four attacks on three commercial ships operating in international waters. The attacks involved a combination of explosive drones and anti-ship ballistic missiles. The US Navy already had a guided missile destroyer in the vicinity, the USS Carney, which managed to shoot down three of the drones. Others hit their targets, causing some damage but no casualties. ""These attacks"" said the Pentagon, ""represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security."" In a further statement it added that it believed the attacks from Yemen were ""enabled by Iran"". The location of the attacks is significant. They took place just north of the strategic chokepoint of the Bab El Mandeb Strait, a 20-mile wide channel that separates Africa from the Arabian Peninsula and through which about 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass every year. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal and heading on south to the Indian Ocean has to pass this strait, close to the coast of Yemen. So what was behind these attacks and what exactly is the link to Gaza? Most of the populated parts of Yemen, including its Red Sea coast, have been under the control of a tribal militia known as the Houthis which overthrew the legitimate, elected Yemeni government in late 2014. They are backed by Iran which has allegedly been supplying them with weapons and training, including drone and missile technology, just as it has with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Houthi coup triggered a catastrophic civil war that has dragged on for more than nine years, causing thousands of casualties and triggering a humanitarian disaster. While Iran backs the Houthis, Saudi Arabia and the UAE went to war against them in 2015, backed by the US and UK, in an unsuccessful bid to restore the internationally recognised government. During this war the Houthis have fired numerous long-range missiles and drones at targets in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and inside Yemen, hitting civil airports, towns and petrochemical infrastructure as well as military targets. Following the outbreak of the latest Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza on 7 October, the Houthis declared their support for what they called ""their brothers in Gaza"" and have fired missiles and drones towards Eilat and other targets in Israel. These were intercepted by the US Navy's USS Carney which shot them down. But the Houthis have also targeted any shipping which they suspect of having Israeli connections. In November they landed troops by helicopter on the deck of a cargo ship, the Galaxy Leader, and seized it. They have vowed to prevent any Israeli vessels from passing their coast and in a statement on Sunday their military spokesman said the vessels they fired missiles at were attacked because they were ""Israeli"". Israel's military denied any connection between its government and the ships but media reports say there are some private commercial links with wealthy Israeli businessmen. The US has said subsequently it is ""considering all appropriate responses in full coordination with its allies and partners"". In practice, Washington will be reluctant to raise tensions any further in a region already nervous about spill-over from the war in Gaza. But if the Houthis in Yemen continue to fire missiles beyond their borders, then eventually the US may decide it needs to retaliate by targeting those missile launch sites. If that happens then there follows the risk that Iran, which supports the Houthis, could also retaliate, potentially leading to the nightmare scenario of a direct conflict between Iran and the US. For now, this is something both sides wish to avoid.",2023-12-06T15:53:39.000Z

Images show tours on board Houthi hijacked shipPublished6 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Groups of men have been photographed taking selfies and tours on a cargo ship seized by Yemen's Houthi rebels last month. The Iran-backed group hijacked the Galaxy Leader in the Red Sea in November, saying it was Israeli. Houthi militia members had earlier threatened to target Israeli ships over its war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel denied the claim, while Japan's government said it was operated by Nippon Yusen. Images taken by Reuters and EPA news agencies appear to show people exploring the large vessel. Nippon Yusen, also known as NYK Line, has said the ship was carrying 25 crew members when it was seized near Hodeida in Yemen on its way to India. Those on board are believed to include Bulgarian, Mexican, Filipino and Ukrainian nationals. Japan's government said in November that its ministries and agencies were working with the relevant countries for the early release of the vessel and its crew. Galaxy Leader is owned by Galaxy Maritime Ltd, which is registered in the Isle of Man. It is owned by Ray Car Carriers, which is co-owned by Israeli businessman Abraham Ungar, according to documents from the Isle of Man government's companies registry. Images from on board have shown large groups of people entering and leaving the ship by motor boat, as well as several Yemenis armed with rifles walking the deck. At least one part of the ship also displayed graffiti with a slogan expressing support for Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",2023-12-06T12:46:31.000Z

"Claims traders profited from attack inaccurate, says IsraelPublished6 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","There is no evidence some investors profited from knowledge of Hamas's attack on Israel before it took place on 7 October, the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) has said. One academic study had suggested investors betting against the Israeli economy made large sums. It said it found significant short-selling in the run-up to the attacks. But the report has since been called ""inaccurate"" and ""irresponsible"" by the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE). The ISA said it was dropping its investigation into the matter. Short-selling is when investors try to make money on shares, bonds or other financial instruments that they think will fall in price. They arrange to sell shares they do not yet own at the current price, hoping to buy them later at a cheaper price before the shares change hands, so they can then bank the difference. ""Days before the attack, traders appeared to anticipate the events to come,"" researchers Robert Jackson Jr from New York University and Joshua Mitts of Columbia University had stated on Tuesday. The researchers said they had identified a dramatic increase in investors seeking to sell shares in Israeli companies on the TASE. But the stock exchange said the claims made in the academic paper since were inaccurate, labelling them ""irresponsible"". TASE said the authors of the report had miscalculated the sums, showing the value of the share prices in agorot, similar to pennies, instead of Israeli shekels. ""Therefore they calculate a profit of NIS 3.2bn (£680m) when in practice the profit was only NIS 32m (£6.8m),"" TASE's head of trade Yaniv Pagot told the publication Globes. He also said claims of a sudden spike in trading before the attack were ""divorced from reality"". The researchers have corrected the currency mistake in their report, but Mr Mitts on Tuesday said that he stood by the ""highly unusual"" exchange traded fund (ETF) and short-dated options activity also identified by the researchers. Correction 7 December: This article updates a previous one that included incorrect currency information provided in the report by Robert Jackson Jr from New York University and Joshua Mitts of Columbia University.",2023-12-06T10:31:04.000Z

Israeli settler violence brings destruction and fear to West Bank as war ragesPublished6 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing,"A few nights ago, the school in Khirbet Zanuta, a small Palestinian village in the hills south of Hebron, was destroyed along with most of the houses, by a bulldozer. Its tracks lay fresh and undisturbed in the sand when we arrived. The village was empty as its population of about 200 Palestinians left around a month ago, after sustained pressure and threats from armed and aggressive Jewish settlers who live in nearby outposts that are illegal under both Israeli and international law. A twisted metal sign lies in the rubble of the school in Khirbet Zanuta. In bold black letters it reads ""Humanitarian Support to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank"". The sign records the donors who gave money to the project. The European Union was the lead donor and, among a panel of European development agencies, is also the coat of arms of the British royal family over the words British Consulate-General Jerusalem. Nadav Weiman came with the BBC to the village. He is a former Israeli special forces soldier who is now an activist with Breaking the Silence, a group of former combatants who campaign against Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. Nadav believes that Jewish settlers, the most militant of whom are known by name to local Palestinians, were once again flouting the law with the police and army. ""They're demolishing Palestinian villages, beating up Palestinian farmers, stealing their olives, trying to open a third front, an eastern front against the Palestinians in the West Bank. Why? Because they want the land without Palestinians."" Two Israeli soldiers came to investigate what we were doing. One of them told an Israeli member of the BBC team that he was a traitor for visiting Palestinians. They filmed us but took much less interest in what had happened in Khirbet Zanuta, a few miles down the road. When I asked the police if they were investigating the flattening of the school and the village, they emailed back that they were waiting for a complaint. In fact, lawyers for Zanuta's Palestinians had petitioned Israel's Supreme Court. In three days of travelling through the occupied West Bank, Palestinians have said consistently that since the war in Gaza started on 7 October, Jewish settlers are better armed and much more aggressive. Violent attacks, including fatal shootings of Palestinians by armed Jewish settlers in the West Bank have risen sharply. So many attacks are happening that Israel's closest allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have condemned violence by extremist settlers and demanded that those guilty of crimes should be prosecuted. In practice, settlers rarely end up in court and if they do, they can usually expect light sentences. The settlers are armed and supported by powerful allies in the Israeli government, led by Itamar Ben Gvir, the minister for national security and Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister who also has security responsibilities in the West Bank. Controversially, Mr Smotrich just found more than $100 million for the settlers. Apparently referring to opinion polls saying Palestinians were supporting Hamas, he told The Times of Israel newspaper that ""there are two million Nazis in Judea and Samaria, who hate us exactly as do the Nazis of Hamas-ISIS in Gaza"". Judea and Samaria is a biblical term for the West Bank. The reality of settler attacks was captured in a video taken by Muntassar Mhilat, a young Palestinian man from a family of Bedouins who live in the Judean desert not far from Jericho. Their family home was invaded by about 20 violent, armed Jewish men. Muntassar filmed them yelling and pointing weapons. ""He was shooting at my uncle, so I ran down there and confronted him. We were pushing each other and screaming, head-to-head. And I was filming him. Then, around 20 settlers came."" The video shows a settler loading his M-16 assault rifle and pointing it at the family. One of the women there, Umm Omar, carrying a month old baby, thought they were about to die. ""They attacked our house, stole our sheep, threatened my kids with guns and threatened me. Then they hit me and my husband's sister. I thought they were going to slaughter us."" No-one was killed. The settlers accused them, falsely the family said, of stealing their goats. The man who pointed a loaded weapon was wearing a police jacket. A common complaint is that settlers have been drafted into the security forces as reservists since 7 October and are abusing the power and position that come with the uniform and automatic weapons issued by the state. The family recognised some of the attackers, as they came from an illegal outpost about a mile away. They know there will be a next time and feel sick with worry. The harassment of Palestinians is also economic and psychological. South of Hebron Palestinian farmers are ploughing with the donkey because local Jewish settlers have threatened to steal or break their tractor if they use it. Almost at the other end of the West Bank, in a village outside Nablus called Burin, Ahmed Tirawi, a farmer looked across the valley at his olive trees, starting to rot because he has been forbidden by the local settlers to pick them. ""If I go up there on the hillside to harvest my olives, it's taking my life in my hands. The settlers make attacks on the farmers here - one bullet and they will kill me."" The olive season is always a time of tension, but this time he said it has been ""horrible"". ""My feelings are more than anger. I feel humiliated by all of this. I am powerless to protect myself from just one settler. It's such a humiliation to be so alone and unable to protect yourself. The only solution is international law, two states and to protect people from the Israeli occupation."" I went to talk to Yehuda Simon, a prominent settler leader at his own outpost, Havat Gilad, near Nablus. He is a lawyer who has represented settlers accused of attacking Palestinians, and he nodded approvingly when I said Palestinian farmers in the area near where he lived were being stopped from harvesting their olives. ""The army came to the conclusion that the Palestinians coming to harvest olives are gathering information in order to carry out an attack like on 7 October."" He dismissed the repeated, documented reports of settlers attacking Palestinians. ""I don't hear about people who kill Palestinians. Okay. If the Palestinian just sits on his balcony and the settlers come and kill him, it's never happened. Okay. And I don't believe that the British and United States and all countries in the world, they are a friend of Israel… even Joe Biden is against Jewish people. He doesn't like Jewish people."" As for the Arabs: ""They could stay here with us, but not try to kill us in the beginning."" For more than a century, Arabs and Jews have been fighting over this small piece of land. The war in Gaza hasn't just increased violence in the West Bank. The way it ends, when it ends, will affect whether the next generation can escape this endless conflict. The sight of families forced out of their homes raises memories of 1948 for Palestinians. By the time Israel won the battle for its independence, more than 700,000 Palestinians had either fled or been expelled from their homes at gunpoint. The new state took their property and never allowed them to go home. Palestinians call the events of 1948 the ""Nakba"" or catastrophe. Settler violence and the loss of homes confirm, for Palestinians, their worst fears, that powerful forces in Israel's government and the settler movement want them out and are using the huge crisis surrounding the war in Gaza to make it happen.",2023-12-06T06:00:02.000Z

Israel says troops are in centre of Khan YounisPublished5 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israeli military says its forces have entered the centre of Khan Younis, the main city in southern Gaza. It also said fierce clashes were taking place in Jabalia and Shejaiya in northern Gaza in the heaviest day of fighting so far. Hamas said it had destroyed Israeli military vehicles and used snipers against troops. The UN says the situation in southern Gaza is getting worse and distributing food there is nearly impossible. Hundreds of people have been killed since Israel began bombing southern Gaza last week after a temporary ceasefire ended. On Tuesday officials from the Hamas-run health ministry said at least 45 people had been killed in Israeli strikes on homes in the central city of Deir al-Balah. Hamas officials say at least 16,248 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the conflict, including more than 7,000 children and nearly 5,000 women. Israel launched air strikes and a ground invasion of Gaza after Hamas attacked nearby military bases, kibbutzes and a music festival, killing about 1,200 people. The Israeli military says it is working to destroy Hamas in Gaza and rescue 138 hostages it says are being held in Gaza. However on Tuesday Israeli media reported that Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had told relatives of those still being held that there was ""no possibility right now of bringing everyone home"". Before a temporary truce collapsed last Friday, the Israeli ground operation was focused on the north of Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a blanket order to all 1.1 million people living there to move south and many went to Khan Younis. The Israeli government and military insists it is doing what it can to minimise civilian casualties in Gaza and blames Hamas for operating in densely populated areas. After several days of telling people in some parts of Khan Younis to leave, the Israeli military on Tuesday told them instead to remain in designated shelters and hospitals. ""Don't get out. Going out is dangerous. You have been warned,"" said the leaflets, addressed to residents of six city districts. It had previously told them to head towards Rafah near the border with Egypt and to an area near the coast called al-Mawasi. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said limits on the amount of aid allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt ""strangles our operations"". ""The siege might become a major source of death,"" he said. The World Food Programme said the distribution of aid was now ""almost impossible"". On Tuesday Samah Ilwan, a mother-of-six, was waving empty bottles and pleading for help in the centre of Khan Younis. Her children were thirsty, she told the BBC. ""We have become like cats and dogs... We're stranded in the street,"" she said, adding: ""I want to send a message to the world that we are innocent. We didn't do anything wrong.""",2023-12-05T23:18:13.000Z

US sanctions individuals implicated in West Bank attacksPublished5 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The US has announced a visa ban on extremists responsible for violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was taking action to target attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians. But the top diplomat said the ban would also apply to Palestinians accused of violence. Attacks have surged in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's assault on southern Israel on 7 October. US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said the ban would affect ""dozens"" of extremist Israelis and some of their family members. He said that laws forbid the US from naming those targeted. The move marks the latest expression of frustration from Washington at the Israeli government's position towards settlers. Senior far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich - both settlers themselves - have previously been accused of seeking to downplay violence in the West Bank. And in recent weeks Palestinians in the West Bankhave told BBC Newsthat Israeli settlers are using the war in Gaza as an opportunity to seize land. More than 700,000 Jewish people live in more than 250 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel and the US dispute this interpretation. The UN says it has recorded 314 settler attacks against Palestinians since 7 October, resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to Palestinian-owned property. Four Israelis, including three security forces personnel, have been killed in attacks by Palestinians in the West Bank over the same period. ""We have underscored to the Israeli government the need to do more to hold accountable extremist settlers who have committed violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank,"" Mr Blinken said in a statement on Tuesday. ""As President Biden has repeatedly said, those attacks are unacceptable."" The decision comes just over a month after Israel was accepted into the US Visa Waiver Program, which allows Israeli citizens visa-free travel to the US. Individuals targeted by Tuesday's announcement will not be eligible for the programme, according to the Associated Press news agency, and current US visa holders will have their travel passes revoked. American passport holders are not affected by the new policy. Reacting to the US decision, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters: ""There is, sadly, violence from extremists that we must condemn."" ""In a state of law, and Israel is a state of law, the right to use violence belongs only to those who are certified to do so by the government,"" he said, according to Reuters.",2023-12-05T23:12:10.000Z

US college presidents testify on campus antisemitismPublished5 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The heads of three top US colleges have pushed back against claims that they are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on their campuses. The leaders, who included Harvard president Claudine Gay, testified before the House of Representatives. The students at the universities have accused administrators of not protecting Jewish people since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Jewish students said they faced antisemitic threats, assault and more. In testimony to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Professor Gay acknowledged a rising tide of antisemitism and Islamophobia on campus since 7 October, when Hamas attacked Israel, which responded with a bombardment of Gaza and ground offensive. She said it has been a challenge to balance freedom of speech and protest on campus while also protecting students against hate. ""This is difficult work. And I know that I have not always gotten it right,"" Prof Gay said. She testified alongside two other presidents of elite American colleges: University of Pennsylvania president Liz Magill and Massachusetts Institute of Technology president Sally Kornbluth. They were called to testify before Congress by Virginia Foxx, the Republican chairwoman of the committee, after some House members accused the universities of ""mishandling antisemitic, violent"" protests on their campuses. The US Department of Education said in November it had opened an investigation into antisemitism allegations at Harvard. Similar inquiries have been opened recently at other colleges as well. Prof Gay told lawmakers her campus had taken steps to combat antisemitism recently. She noted they had beefed up security, denounced Hamas' attack and reiterated that the school will not tolerate ""speech that incites violence, threatens safety, or violates Harvard's policies"". Ms Foxx said these efforts were not enough and accused college administrators of standing by and ""allowing horrific rhetoric to fester and grow"" during the conflict in the Gaza Strip. US college students have held frequent pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeldemonstrations on college campusessince the start of the war, and some incidents at the protests have raised allegations of antisemitism. Pro-Palestinian rally organisers on college campuses have regularly denied this. They claim they are only calling for an end to violence and Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. But arecent survey by the Anti-Defamation League(ADL) and Hillel International, both Jewish advocacy groups, found that nearly 75% of Jewish college students have experienced some form of antisemitism this school year. Before the presidents' testimonies, several Jewish students appeared at a press conference hosted by House Republicans to share their own experiences of such discrimination. Eyal Yakoby, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, described incidents in which Jewish groups received threatening and antisemitic emails, and another in which a swastika was spray painted in an academic building. ""Why doesn't the university hold the perpetrators of such acts accountable?"" said Mr Yakoby, who told reporters that Jewish students felt unsafe on campus. Some Muslim and pro-Palestinian students at Harvard, meanwhile, havebeen doxxedsince the start of the war. They have had their names and photographs published under the headline ""Harvard's Leading Antisemites"". The Council on American-Islamic Relations has alsoreported a sharp rise in complaints of bias incidentsagainst Muslim people in the US since the war began. On Tuesday, the Republican-majority House also passed a resolution to condemn the ""drastic rise of antisemitism"" in the US and around the world following 7 October. The resolution also stated that ""anti-Zionism is antisemitism"". Some Jewish Democrats in the House, including New York congressmen Jerry Nadler and Dan Goldman, said the resolution was an ""unserious attempt by Republicans to weaponize Jewish pain"". It passed with every Republican vote except one. Thirteen Democrats voted against the resolution, while others voted ""present"".",2023-12-05T22:47:42.000Z

Israel's new Gaza evacuation zones leave Palestinians few places to goPublished5 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are running out of places to flee to, after the Israeli military first ordered tens of thousands to evacuate part of the main city in the south ahead of an assault by tanks and troops. A map posted on social media on Monday told people in northern and central Khan Younisto leave immediatelyto ""preserve your safety and security"". Arrows directed them to move to three already overcrowded areas to the south and west. On Tuesday however, the Israeli military said its forces had already entered the city and it was now too dangerous to leave. ""Don't get out. Going out is dangerous. You have been warned,"" new leaflets said, warning people to stay inside designated shelters and hospitals. The evacuation of specific areas marked on online maps is part of a new approach the military says it is taking to avoid civilian casualties in its eight-week war with Hamas, following heavy pressure from the United States. But there is concern that the strategy is too complicated, too dependent on technology, and too likely to cause panic to be a workable solution. BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, said he had spoken to relatives and other people in the affected areas who were not aware of the IDF's map or could not see it because of patchy internet access and no regular supply of electricity. ""This is a joke, not a map, because we don't know where to go,"" a displaced person who was sheltering in Khan Younis told him. There is also no guarantee they will be safe from bombardment if they flee. The main Palestinian telecommunications firm meanwhile said that all phone and internet services were cut once again. Before a temporary truce collapsed last Friday, the Israeli ground operation was focused on the north of Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a blanket order to all 1.1 million people living there to move south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety. Hundreds of thousands heeded the call as Israeli troops penetrated deep into Gaza City - with many of them eventually ending up in Khan Younis. The IDF alsorepeatedly urged civiliansacross Gaza to move to al-Mawasi, a thin strip of territory along the Mediterranean coast which officials described as a ""humanitarian zone"". During a visit to Israel on Thursday while the fighting was paused, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saidhe had told Israeli leadersthat they had to ""put in place humanitarian civilian protection plans that minimize further casualties of innocent Palestinians"". These included ""clearly and precisely designating areas and places in southern and central Gaza where they can be safe and out of the line of fire"", he added. The IDF's response was to publish on its Arabic-language website on Friday an""Evacuation Zone Map""that divided Gaza into more than 600 numbered blocks, ranging in size from about 0.03 to 25 sq km (0.001 to 9.6 sq miles). Jets also dropped leaflets with QR codes, allowing people with a working smartphone and an internet connection to access the map - and also asking them to share their location. Asked about this approach on Monday, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said it had ""seen improvements"". ""We have seen them evacuate specific neighbourhoods, rather than entire areas, so the number of displaced persons will hopefully be lower in southern Gaza than it was in the north,"" he added. However the IDF's order for civilians to move from Khan Younis to Rafah was condemned by the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, which runs the biggest humanitarian operation in Gaza and has 958,000 displaced people sheltering at 99 facilities in the south. ""The order created panic, fear and anxiety,"" warned Philippe Lazzarini on Monday evening. ""At least an additional 60,000 people were forced to move to already overcrowded Unrwa shelters, with more asking to be sheltered."" ""The evacuation order pushes people to concentrate into what is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip,"" he added. Mr Lazzarini also stressed that ""no place is safe in Gaza, whether in the south, or the south-west, whether in Rafah or in any unilaterally called 'safe zone'"". Unicef spokesman James Elder, who was recently in Gaza, told the BBC on Tuesday that the idea of a ""safe zone"" was a ""dangerous false narrative"". He said that under international law Israel had to ensure places of evacuation had conditions for people to survive. In an apparent reference to al-Mawasi, he added: ""These are tiny patches of barren land. They have no water, no facilities, no shelter from the cold, no sanitation."" A senior adviser to Israel's prime minister rejected such criticism in a BBC interview on Monday. ""I don't believe that nowhere is safe,"" Mark Regev said. ""We've designated safer zones for people to go to. If you believe the Hamas propaganda, we're just hitting innocent buildings, right? But if we're hitting a structure, it's because there's Hamas either in or under the structure."" Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 70% of the almost 15,900 people killed there since the start of the conflict have been women and children. Israel launched a military campaign in response to a cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people - including many women and children - were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.",2023-12-05T19:49:45.000Z

"Israel Gaza: Hamas raped and mutilated women on 7 October, BBC hearsPublished5 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The BBC has seen and heard evidence of rape, sexual violence and mutilation of women during the 7 October Hamas attacks. WARNING: CONTAINS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND RAPE Several people involved in collecting and identifying the bodies of those killed in the attack told us they had seen multiple signs of sexual assault, including broken pelvises, bruises, cuts and tears, and that the victims ranged from children and teenagers to pensioners. Video testimony of an eyewitness at the Nova music festival, shown to journalists by Israeli police, detailed the gang rape, mutilation and execution of one victim. Videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers. Few victims are thought to have survived to tell their own stories. Their last moments are being pieced together from survivors, body-collectors, morgue staff and footage from the attack sites. Police have privately shown journalists a single horrific testimony that they filmed of a woman who was at the Nova festival site during the attack. She describes seeing Hamas fighters gang rape a woman and mutilate her, before the last of her attackers shot her in the head as he continued to rape her. In the video, the woman known as Witness S mimes the attackers picking up and passing the victim from one to another. ""She was alive,"" the witness says. ""She was bleeding from her back."" She goes on to detail how the men cut off parts of the victim's body during the assault. ""They sliced her breast and threw it on the street,"" she says. ""They were playing with it."" The victim was passed to another man in uniform, she continues. ""He penetrated her, and shot her in the head before he finished. He didn't even pick up his pants; he shoots and ejaculates."" One man we spoke to from the festival site said he heard the ""noises and screams of people being murdered, raped, decapitated"". To our question about how he could be sure - without seeing it - that the screams he heard indicated sexual assault rather than other kinds of violence, he said he believed while listening at the time that it could only have been rape. A statement he made through a support organisation describes it as ""inhuman"". ""Some women were raped before they were dead, some raped while injured, and some were already dead when the terrorists raped their lifeless bodies,"" his statement says. ""I desperately wanted to help, but there was nothing I could do."" Police say they have ""multiple"" eye-witness accounts of sexual assault, but wouldn't give any more clarification on how many.  When we spoke to them, they hadn't yet interviewed any surviving victims. Hamas has rejected Israel's accusation that its men sexually assaulted women during the attacks. Israel's Women's Empowerment Minister, May Golan, told the BBC that a few victims of rape or sexual assault had survived the attacks, and that they were all currently receiving psychiatric treatment. ""But very, very few. The majority were brutally murdered,"" she said. ""They aren't able to talk - not with me, and not to anyone from the government [or] from the media."" Videos filmed by Hamas include footage of one woman, handcuffed and taken hostage with cuts to her arms and a large patch of blood staining the seat of her trousers. In others, women carried away by the fighters appear to be naked or semi-clothed. Multiple photographs from the sites after the attack show the bodies of women naked from the waist down, or with their underwear ripped to one side, legs splayed, with signs of trauma to their genitals and legs. ""It really feels like Hamas learned how to weaponise women's bodies from ISIS [the Islamic State group] in Iraq, from cases in Bosnia,"" said Dr Cochav Elkayam-Levy, a legal expert at the Davis Institute of International Relations at Hebrew University. ""It brings me chills just to know the details that they knew about what to do to women: cut their organs, mutilate their genitals, rape. It's horrifying to know this."" ""I spoke with at least three girls who are now hospitalised for a very hard psychiatric situation because of the rapes they watched,"" Minister May Golan told me. ""They pretended to be dead and they watched it, and heard everything.  And they can't deal with it."" Israel's police chief Yaacov Shabtai said that many survivors of the attacks were finding it difficult to talk and that he thought some of them would never testify about what they saw or experienced. ""Eighteen young men and women have been hospitalised in mental health hospitals because they could no longer function,"" he said. Others are reportedly suicidal. One of those working with the teams around survivors told the BBC that some had already killed themselves. Much of the evidence has come from the volunteer body-collectors deployed after the attacks, and those who handled the bodies once they arrived at the Shura army base for identification. One of the body-collectors volunteering with the religious organisation Zaka described to me signs of torture and mutilation which included, he said, a pregnant woman whose womb had been ripped open before she was killed, and her foetus stabbed while it was inside her. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this account, and Israeli media reports have questioned some testimony from volunteers working in the traumatic aftermath of the Hamas attacks. Another, Nachman Dyksztejna, provided written testimony of seeing the bodies of two women in kibbutz Be'eri with their hands and legs tied to a bed. ""One was sexually terrorised with a knife stuck in her vagina and all her internal organs removed,"" his statement says. At the festival site, he says small shelters were ""filled with piles of women. Their clothing was torn on the upper part, but their bottoms were completely naked. Piles and piles of women. […] When you took a closer look at their heads, you saw a single shot straight to the brain of each."" Hundreds of bodies were collected from the attack sites by volunteers. Investigators admit that in those first chaotic days after the attacks, with some areas still active combat zones, opportunities to carefully document the crime scenes, or take forensic evidence, were limited or missed. ""For the first five days, we still had terrorists on the ground in Israel,"" May Golan said. ""And there were hundreds, hundreds of bodies everywhere. They were burned, they were without organs, they were butchered completely."" ""This was a mass casualty event,"" police spokesman Dean Elsdunne told journalists at a briefing. ""The first thing was to work on identifying the victims, not necessarily on crime scene investigation. People were waiting to hear what happened to their loved ones."" It was staff at the army's Shura base, where bodies arrived for identification, who have provided investigators with some of the most crucial evidence. This evidence emerged from a makeshift hub of tents and refrigerated shipping containers set up at the base to identify the bodies. When we visited, hospital trolleys, their iron skeletons topped with khaki stretchers, stood neatly lined up in front of the containers that housed the dead; the white plastic overalls of those on shift translucent under the floodlights. Fighter jets roared overhead, drowning out the cicadas, as Israel's bombardment of Gaza continued. Teams here told us they'd seen clear evidence of rape and sexual violence on the bodies coming in, including broken pelvises from sustained violent abuse. ""We see women of all ages,"" one of the reservists on the forensic team, Captain Maayan, told the BBC. ""We see rape victims. We see women who have been through violation. We have pathologists and we see the bruises, we learn about the cuts and tears, and we know they have been sexually abused."" I ask her what proportion of the bodies she's handled show signs of this. ""Abundant,"" she said. ""Abundant amount of women and girls of all ages."" The number of victims is hard to define, partly because of the state of the bodies. ""It's definitely multiple,"" said another serving soldier who asked us to use only her first name, Avigayil. ""It's hard to tell. I've dealt with more than a few burned bodies and I have no idea what they went through beforehand. And bodies that are missing the bottom half - I also don't know if they were raped. But women that were clearly raped? There are enough. More than enough."" ""Sometimes we are left only with a very small part of the body,"" Dr Elkayam-Levy tells me. ""Maybe it's a finger, a foot or a hand that they're trying to identify. People were burned to ashes. Nothing was left. […] I want to say that we'll never know how many cases there were."" Privately some of those working on this talk in terms of ""dozens"" of victims but quickly caution that evidence is still being gathered and pieced together. The civil commission headed by Dr Elkayam-Levy, to collect testimony on sexual crimes, is calling for international recognition that what happened on 7 October was systematic abuse, constituting Crimes Against Humanity. ""We see definite patterns,"" she told me. ""So it wasn't incidental, it wasn't random. They came with a clear order. It was […] rape as genocide."" Avigayil agrees there were similarities in the violence visited on the bodies that arrived at the Shura base. ""There are patterns in that groups of women from the same place were treated in a similar manner,"" she said. ""There might be a set of women who were raped in one way, and we're seeing similarities in the bodies; and then a different set that were not raped but shot multiple times in the exact same pattern. So it seems that different groups of terrorists had different forms of cruelty."" ""This was a premeditative, systematic event,"" police chief Yaacov Shabtai told journalists. David Katz from Israel's cyber crime unit which is involved in the investigation, told journalists that it was too early to prove that sexual violence was planned as part of the attack, but that data extracted from the phones of the Hamas attackers suggested that ""everything was systematic"". ""It would be reckless to say we can already prove it […] but everything that was done there was done systematically,"" he said. ""Nothing happened by coincidence. Rape was systematic."" Israel's government points to documents it says were found on Hamas fighters that appear to support the idea that sexual violence was planned. It's released clips of interrogations with some captured fighters in which they appear to say that women were targeted for this purpose. Last week, UN Women put out a statement saying it ""unequivocally condemn[ed] the brutal attacks by Hamas"" and was ""alarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence during those attacks"". Dr Elkayam-Levy said before the statement that international women's rights organisations had taken far too long to respond to her call for support. ""This is the most documented atrocity humanity has known,"" she told me. ""Israel on 7 October is not the same country that woke up the following morning,"" said police chief Yaacov Shabtai. Amid the horror of what happened to women here, Captain Maayan from the Shura identification unit says the hardest moments are when she sees ""the mascara on their eyelashes, or the earrings they put on that morning"". I ask where that lands in her, as a woman. ""Terror,"" she replied. ""It terrorises us."" Additional reporting by Scarlett Barter",2023-12-05T17:15:49.000Z

Israel orders evacuations from city in south Gaza as offensive widensPublished4 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel's military has ordered the evacuation of a fifth of the main city in southern Gaza, as it expands its ground offensive against Hamas. A map showed six northern and central areas of Khan Younis where an estimated 167,000 people needed to leave. Witnesses also reported seeing tanks to the east, and a doctor said a local hospital was overwhelmed by casualties. In Gaza City, an unconfirmed report says 50 people were killed when Israeli air strikes hit two schools. According to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, they died in schools sheltering displaced people in the city's Daraj neighbourhood. Reuters news agency has said that the strikes are still to be independently verified and that the Hamas-run health ministry could not be reached for comment. The Israeli army said it was looking into the report. Many of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are sheltering in the south after being previously ordered to leave the north. The Israeli military said it would operate with ""maximum force"" in the south, as it had done in the north - where there has been widespread destruction over the past eight weeks. Israel launched a full-scale campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says almost 15,900 people have been killed in the territory since the war began, while the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding. A temporary ceasefire that lasted for seven days, which led to the release of 105 of the hostages and 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails, fell apart on Friday. BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, says about 200 Israeli air strikes were reported overnight. About 15 to 20 locations were targeted in and around Khan Younis, where the local population has swelled to as much as 1.2 million, according to local authorities. The central town of Deir al-Balah, about 8km (5 miles) to the north, was also bombed heavily. Dozens of casualties, including women and children, arrived at Khan Younis's Nasser Hospital from different areas. Many were dead or seriously injured. Mohammed Eid wiped tears from his bandaged face as he lined up among the mourners by bodies covered in white shrouds outside the hospital on Monday morning. ""We were sleeping safely, minding our own business. Suddenly, a bomb fell on us, and the whole building was destroyed,"" he told the BBC. ""My brother was torn into pieces, and so was his wife. My daughter was killed, and his daughters were killed, including his littlest. We can't find my mum, and my niece."" Later, witnesses and local journalists in Gaza reported that they had seen Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles on the eastern outskirts of Khan Younis, by Abasan and Khuzaa, which is nearest to the boundary fence with Israel. Moaz Mohammed told AFP news agency that he had seen tanks moving down the main north-south highway, Salah al-Din Road, which has been one of two Israeli-designated evacuation routes. The tanks were ""firing bullets and tank shells at cars and people trying to move through the area"" between Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, he said. At the same time, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned civilians to avoid a section of Salah al-Din Road in the same area, saying it now constituted a ""battlefield"" and was ""extremely dangerous"". The IDF also posted a mapthat ordered residents of six northern and central neighbourhoods of Khan Younis - al-Mahatta, al-Katiba, Hamad, al-Satir, Bani Suheila and Ma'in - to leave immediately to ""preserve your safety and security"". According to the UN, the marked area in Khan Younis was home to almost 117,000 people before the war. It also includes 21 shelters where 50,000 displaced people are currently living. The map tells them to move to al-Fukhari, east of Khan Younis, and Rafah's al-Shaboura and Tal al-Sultan neighbourhoods, which are already overcrowded. IDF chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that Israeli forces were continuing to operate with ""maximum force against Hamas terrorists and infrastructure, while minimising harm to the civilians that Hamas places around them as shields"". ""We are dropping leaflets with QR codes that opens a map guiding Gazans to safer areas. The map is divided into neighbourhood numbers indicating where civilians in a specific area should go to avoid being in the crossfire,"" he added. The IDF has introduced the scheme because it is under heavy pressure from the US to protect civilians. However, our Gaza correspondent says he has spoken to Palestinians in the affected areas who are not aware of the map or cannot see it because there is no internet coverage. ""This is a joke, not a map, because we don't know where to go,"" a displaced person who was sheltering in Khan Younis told him. Meanwhile, an orthopaedic surgeon at the European Hospital in Khan Younis told the BBC that it was overwhelmed by hundreds of wounded. ""It is chaotic - we can't absorb any more patients and they keep coming,"" Dr Paul Ley said. ""We have more than 360 people on the operating list, which is impossible to deal with."" Dr Ley also said the hospital's corridors and grounds were full with 6,000 to 7,000 displaced people, some of whom were medics who had fled the north. ""Anaesthetics and pain killers are a big problem - we are running out slowly so we are lowering our safety standards. We never leave the hospital and our presence here has been notified to the Israelis, but shrapnel has reached the hospital,"" he added. Médecins Sans Frontières also warned that more than 100 dead and over 400 injured people had arrived at the emergency room of Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah in the last 48 hours, and that there was no space for new patients. The UN said on Monday that four hospitals in the north were partially operating and admitting patients, with only limited services. The 12 hospitals in the south are partially functional, but bed capacity is only half what it was before the war and only one hospital can perform complex surgery.",2023-12-04T23:14:59.000Z

Teenage British-Israeli soldier Binyamin Needham killed in GazaPublished4 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A British-Israeli teenager has been killed in Gaza while serving in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Binyamin Needham, 19, reportedly moved from England to Israel with his family when he was eight-years-old. He is at least the second UK citizen to have died while serving in the Israeli military during the current conflict. Mr Needham's sister told Israeli media her brother was ""always smiling, always loving"" and had only recently completed his training.

Rushdi Abualouf: 'It's so much harder to watch Gaza from the outside'Published4 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf, who has reported from Gaza for decades, left the territory with his family on 20 November for the sake of their safety. It was six weeks after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel that has led to weeks of Israeli bombardment within Gaza. He is now in Istanbul, Turkey. Speaking on the BBC's Newshour programme, he described how it felt to leave his home and observe Gaza from the outside. My family and I grew up in Gaza, we were born in Gaza. I really feel sad that I have had to leave in this way. I have a memory from every corner of my house, and from every corner of my neighbourhood. The rest of my wife's family - her father, mother and brother - are still there, while my father, brothers and sisters also remain in Gaza. To be honest, it's more difficult for me to watch Gaza from the outside, because when I was there, inside the enclave, I was busy dealing with too many things and not thinking about the situation in the Strip. Now, when you are out, you have more time to think. And it's very hard for me to imagine that I will no longer see my house or sleep in my bed, and I will no longer see my neighbours and my neighbourhood. Since we left for Istanbul, we were told that our home was destroyed. I mean the whole building, the whole neighbourhood was destroyed. Some of my BBC Arabic colleagues are still there. I met them all one night before I left because I wasn't sure about the timing, and there was a surprise call in the night telling me to leave. I told them I would do everything I could to get them out. ""Be strong and work together, the BBC is very proud of you, the BBC will do everything possible to protect you and try to get you out,"" I told them. I've called them every morning since I left Gaza. I'm always with them, always advising them, helping them solve every problem they are facing in their location or with their family, and hopefully they will be out soon. My family had a chance to leave right at the beginning. When Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, my first call was to the BBC to tell them what happened. The second was to my wife. I said to her: ""Please prepare your bag, you have to leave Gaza now."" I was expecting a very big retaliation from Israel, and the Rafah crossing was still open for the first couple of days after the Hamas raids. At the beginning, my wife did not realise how big the situation would be and how dangerous it was. I would have to stay to work, and because she didn't want us to be apart, she refused and said: ""We will stay together, live together."" On the third day we lost this chance - the Rafah crossing was bombed and closed. And then you have to deal with so many things. You have to deal with your old father who lives far away from you. You have to learn to deal with your family and you have to deal with your job. You have to report, and all the time in the back of your mind is your father, in the back of your mind is your wife, your kids, your place - whenever they drop a bomb, you think: is it close to your house? After we were forced to leave Gaza City, we first arrived in Khan Younis and stayed with family for a couple of days. Then there was a warning that the house would be bombed. So we had to leave and found ourselves with nowhere to go. I decided to put up a tent near a workspace I'd set up in Nasr hospital in Khan Younis. My family stayed there for about a week. I found a house near the hospital so that they could be close to me, so if something happened I could rush to them. My flat in Gaza City was 170 sq m, but now everyone was squeezed into one small room. They were worried about me not being with them all the time, and also there was not enough food. My wife was injured that day when she tried to come and see me. The kids were crying that they wanted to see their dad and they decided to go from the house to the hospital. When they arrived, one of the buildings was hit - that day they almost died. Now that we are out, I know that I will definitely go back. I always say as a journalist that Gaza is the perfect place to be - because you will find a story on every corner. But for me personally, my family has been suffering for a very long time. I told my wife when we left Gaza, when we walked out of the gate: ""I will not let you go back under any circumstances. ""So you have to start establishing your life somewhere else."" Now my kids are happy to be out, to go back to a normal life, though they still miss everything. But I am a journalist, and as soon as the situation allows me to go back to Gaza I will, because I'm connected to this story and I think those 2.3 million people in the Strip deserve having somebody to tell their story.",2023-12-04T20:39:35.000Z

Tributes to former Glasgow university student killed in GazaPublished4 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Tributes have been paid to a former University of Glasgow student who has died in Gaza. Dima Alhaj was killed last month alongside her six-month-old baby, her husband and her two brothers. Roseann Maguire, who hosted Ms Alhaj in Glasgow for two months, remembered her as a ""lovely young woman"". Ms Alhaj was working for the World Health Organisation (WHO), who announced the news of her death on social media. Dozens of her family members were also killed in the explosion, believed to have been caused by an airstrike. The 29-year-old had studied in Glasgow as part of the Erasmus programme, before returning to Gaza where she worked with the WHO Trauma and Emergency Team. Ms Maguire recalled that the former student had always planned to return home to Gaza after her studies. She said: ""Dima was very concerned about the situation of people in Gaza, and she wanted to go back and help in some way. That was the kind of young woman she was."" Ms Alhaj stayed with Ms Maguire and Gerry O'Hare in their Glasgow home after her initial accommodation plans fell through. Ms Maguire recalled: ""She really enjoyed the freedom of Glasgow... She called us her second family."" The three remained in touch after Ms Alhaj returned to Gaza. Mr O'Hare became friends with her father, a doctor in the area. Ms Maguire last heard from Ms Alhaj on 13 November, just over a week before she was killed. She said: ""The messages started saying 'this is terrible', and then got shorter [as time went on]. They were just saying 'I'm alive. Pray for me.'"" The last message sent to Ms Maguire stated: ""No words to express. Please pray for us. This is Abood, my little boy. I hope he lives to see better days."" Mr O'Hare, who once visited the Alhaj family in Gaza, added: ""This was a family house, they showed me round the fruit trees. For the life of me I can't understand why a family home, detached, would be the subject of a massive bomb attack."" More than 100 University of Glasgow students and members of the public attended a candlelight vigil held in Ms Alhaj's memory last week. Officials in Gaza say more than 14,800 people including about 6,000 children have been killed since Israel began its military campaign against Hamas there, with thousands more believed to be dead under rubble. It follows Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October during which it killed about 1,200 people and kidnapped 240 others. Israel's bombardment of Gaza has now resumed after a temporary ceasefire ended on Friday.",2023-12-04T18:42:09.000Z

Hamas planned sexual violence as weapon of war - Israeli campaignerPublished4 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hamas had a premeditated plan to use sexual violence as a weapon of war, an Israeli women's rights campaigner and lawyer has said. Prof Ruth Halperin-Kaddari said she saw footage of women in several locations whose condition left her in ""no doubt"" that they had been raped. There has been anger over the delay of some UN bodies to acknowledge claims of Hamas's sexual atrocities on 7 October. Israel has been exploring evidence of sexual crimes during the attacks. Warning: This article contains graphic details which some readers may find upsetting Israeli police say they have so far gathered more than 1,500 testimonies from witnesses and medics. Hamas has denied the group carried out sexual violence during the 7 October attacks. Pictures and live footage streamed by the militants pointed to the gruesome nature of the attacks atthe Supernova festival. A range of violence from gang rape to the sexual mutilation of murdered victims are being investigated by police. ""I saw a number of first-hand, eyewitness accounts, for example of one survivor who hid in the bushes and saw a woman next to her being raped by several men,"" Prof Halperin-Kaddari told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said she also spoke to a paramedic who treated a woman who lost a life-threatening amount of blood after reporting being raped by four men. ""I saw footage and pictures from numerous locations of bodies whose condition were all exhibiting the same pattern of mutilation and leaving no doubt that rape was performed on these women before they were executed,"" she said. Prof Halperin-Kaddari added that the the concentration of cases, all in one day but in several locations left her in ""no doubt"" that there was a ""premeditation to use sexual violence as a weapon of war."" Hamas said it ""rejected and strongly denounced"" the reports of abuses. In a post on the messaging app Telegram, it said that such claims were ""lies"" by Israel that sought to distort the ""humane"" way Hamas has treated Israeli hostages. Hamas took some 240 people hostage on 7 October - 110 were released last week as part of a truce with Israel. Israeli women's rights and legal activists had been calling on key international organisations to publicly acknowledge reports of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, in the wake of Hamas's attacks. On Monday, dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the UN headquarters in New York, protesting over what they said was its inaction over the rape, abduction and mistreatment of Israeli women. Prof Halperin-Kaddari, who spent 12 years as a member of a UN convention on discrimination against women, said she and others have been calling on UN bodies to acknowledge these ""crimes against humanity"". ""Regrettably, until a week ago, none of them said the explicit word 'sexual violence'. It took them more than seven weeks,"" she said. The UN has yet to respond to accusations of a delay, but Prof Halperin-Kaddari visited the UN in Geneva just a week ago to draw attention to the violence. UN Women issued a statement - eight weeks after the attacks - acknowledging accounts of gender-based atrocities. ""This took them too long, much too long,"" Prof Halperin-Kaddari added. Yael Sherer from the Lobby to Combat Sexual Violence advocacy group told Today that men were also victims of sexual violence on 7 October. She said evidence is being gathered from some survivors of the attacks, as well as eyewitnesses and first responders, who have been detailing the violence. ""Hamas terrorists made sure to disgrace these people and dishonour them in many ways,"" she said. This included violence carried out on the victims' bodies after they had died, Ms Sherer added. ""We also saw people who were bleeding... [and] people who were tied down to furniture with zip-ties, and were not clothed, of many ages."" An ongoing UN commission of inquiry investigating alleged war crimes on both sides of the Israel-Hamas conflict will include a focus on sexual violence carried out during the attacks on 7 October. However, Israel has not so far co-operated with the commission, viewing it as biased. Navi Pillay, who chairs the inquiry, said if Tel Aviv did not want to co-operate, her team could still take evidence from survivors and witnesses outside the country. ""All they [Israel] have to do is let us in,"" she told the BBC, adding that survivors of the attacks should be able to get a UN hearing. Ms Pillay also rejected claims that the UN delayed acknowledging that sexual violence had taken place during Hamas's attacks and said ""every effort"" was being made as part of her team's investigations. The Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October killed 1,200 people. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 15,500 people have been killed in Israel's military campaign which it launched in response.",2023-12-04T17:43:46.000Z

"'Wounded child, no surviving family': The pain of Gaza’s orphansPublished4 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Medics working in the Gaza Strip are using a specific phrase to describe a particular kind of war victim. ""There's an acronym that's unique to the Gaza Strip, it's WCNSF - wounded child, no surviving family - and it's not used infrequently,"" Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan who works with Doctors Without Borders told BBC News. The expression captures the horror of the situation for many Gazan children. Their lives change in a second - their parents, siblings and grandparents are killed, and nothing is the same ever again. The war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October killing 1,200 people and taking around 240 others hostage, and Israel launched its military campaign. More than 15,500 people have been killed in the conflict, including about 6,000 children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Ahmed Shabat is one of those children who was described as a wounded child, with no surviving family, when he arrived injured and crying at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza. The three-year-old survived an air strike on his home in Beit Hanoun, in mid-November. But his father, mother and older brother were killed. Miraculously, at the time he had only minor injuries. Later it was revealed his younger brother Omar, aged two, had also survived the strike and they were reunited after an adult member of the wider family was located. ""After the bombing, we learned there was a child in the Indonesian hospital with no-one accompanying him, so we went there immediately,"" Ahmed's uncle Ibrahim Abu Amsha explained. ""Ahmed was with a stranger. He said Ahmed had been blown into the air and was found injured about 20m (65ft) from the house."" Ahmed and Omar were now orphans, homeless, with no shelter to protect them from continuous shelling, so Ibrahim decided to look after them, along with his own family. He initially took them to Sheikh Radwan city but said they left after ""Ahmed was hit by glass fragments"" from an explosion. They then went to Nuseirat camp to stay in a UN-affiliated school. But even in their new location, they were hit again, with devastating consequences for Ahmed. ""I ran out of the school's door and saw Ahmed in front of me on the ground, both legs gone. He was crawling towards me, opening his arms, seeking help."" A family member, who was with Ahmed at the time of the blast, was killed. Ibrahim, who is still displaced with his own family as well as his sister's children, says he dreams of being able to send Ahmed for treatment outside Gaza. ""He wanted to be many things,"" his uncle said sadly. ""When we went out together to attend football matches, he said he wished to become a famous football player."" Like Ahmed, Muna Alwan is also a war orphan and was described as WCNSF when she arrived at the Indonesian Hospital. The two-year-old constantly cries ""Mama"", but her mum is dead. Muna was pulled from under the rubble after an air strike hit a neighbour's house in the Jabal al-Rais area of northern Gaza. Muna's parents, brother and grandfather were killed. Muna's eye was badly injured and her jaw fractured. Muna was transferred to another hospital where she was tracked down by her aunt Hanaa. ""We knew through the internet that Muna was at Nasser Hospital. We came, and we recognised her,"" Hanaa explains. But she says her niece is suffering terribly. ""She just wants to scream, always afraid, especially if someone approaches her,"" Hanaa adds. Muna does have older sisters who are alive but they are in Gaza City. ""They are stuck and there is no way to bring them to the south,"" Hanaa says, adding: ""I constantly ask myself, what will we do? How do we compensate for her mother?"" On a metal bed in the corner of a room at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, 11-year-old Dunya Abu Mehsen looks at what remains of her right leg wrapped in white bandages. The girl, with long curly hair, sits at the edge of the bed, wearing a velvety red dress, silent most of the time, appearing deeply sad. Dunya survived an air strike with her brother, Yusuf, and her younger sister that hit when they were all sleeping at their home in the al-Amal neighbourhood in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza. But her parents, brother and sister were killed. She also lost her right leg. ""When I saw my dad, I was scared because he was covered in blood and stones. People were standing around us, and my sister was screaming,"" Dunya recounts. ""I looked at myself and I didn't have a leg. I felt pain and my only thought was: 'How did I lose my leg?'"" ""Dunya doesn't recall how and when she arrived at the hospital, but she remembers being there alone, and the medical staff repeatedly asking her questions in an attempt to identify her family,"" explains her aunt Fadwa Abu Mehsen. ""She told me: 'I heard the nurse say, 'may God have mercy on them'. I knew she meant my mum and dad.'"" Her aunt, sitting beside her in the hospital room with the wheelchair that has become the only means for the little girl to go outside and breathe fresh air, says: ""She used to be playful, strong and very active before her injury."" Dunya says: ""Today, I lost my leg and my family but I still have dreams. I want to get a prosthetic leg, travel, become a doctor, and for this war to end and our children to live in peace.'"" Determining the precise number of orphaned children in the Gaza Strip is challenging given the ""intensity of hostilities and rapidly evolving situation on the ground"", according to Ricardo Pires, the communication manager at the UN children's fund Unicef. Mr Pires adds that the organisation attempted to reach hospitals and health staff in Gaza to identify and register children, but ""these efforts are proceeding very slowly due to the extremely challenging conditions"". He explained not only was it ""almost impossible"" to identify safe, temporary care arrangements due to ""chaotic and overcrowded"" shelters and hospitals, but ""the normal system to identify document, trace and reunite children with relatives is barely functional"".",2023-12-04T16:19:23.000Z

US warship shoots down drones fired from Houthi-held Yemen in Red SeaPublished4 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A US warship shot down three drones after three commercial vessels came under attack in the Red Sea, the US military has said. It said the USS Carney assisted the ships - which had links to 14 nations including the UK - on Sunday after they were targeted from areas of Yemen held by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Two of the ships were hit by missiles but there were no casualties, it added. A Houthi spokesman said the group's navy had attacked two Israeli ships. The Israeli military said the vessels had no connection to Israel. The Iranian-backed Houthis have controlled parts of Yemen since the movement toppled the country's government in 2014, sparking an ongoing civil war. It has recently begun targeting Israel-linked vessels in the Red Sea over Israel's war with Iranian-backed Hamas in Gaza. US Central Command (Centcom), part of the US military which oversees operations in the Middle East, said that on Sunday morning, the USS Carney detected an anti-ship ballistic missile exploding near the Unity Explorer, a Bahamian-flagged, UK-owned and operated cargo ship. It later shot down a drone that was heading towards the Carney itself, although Centcom said it was not clear whether the drone was targeting the Carney. That afternoon, the Unity Explorer suffered minor damage after being struck by a missile fired from Houthi-controlled area. While responding to a distress call from the ship, the US vessel detected and shot down another incoming drone. Later, two more ships - one of them part UK-owned, both of them flagged in Panama - reported being struck by missiles. While on its way to assist the second ship, the USS Carney shot down a third drone. Centcom said the attacks had ""jeopardised the lives"" of the ships' multinational crews and represented a ""direct threat to international commerce and maritime security"". ""We also have every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran,"" it said. ""The United States will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination with its international allies and partners."" Earlier this week, the US said its warship captured armed men who had earlier seized an Israeli-linked tanker off Yemen's coast. Centcom reported that two missiles were then fired towards the warship from rebel Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen. The Houthis have declared themselves part of an ""axis of resistance"" of Iran-affiliated groups, which works in opposition to Israel, the US, and the wider West.",2023-12-04T02:14:42.000Z

Israeli forces pushing into south GazaPublished3 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli ground forces are pushing into southern Gaza, after three days of heavy bombardment. Initial reports from Israeli army radio effectively confirmed Israel has launched a ground operation to the north of Khan Younis. The BBC has also verified images of an Israeli tank operating near the city. The head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later told troops the IDF was also fighting ""strongly and thoroughly"" in south Gaza. Lt General Herzi Halevi was speaking to reservists from the Gaza division about military objectives and the IDF's killing of Hamas commanders. He told the soldiers: ""We fought strongly and thoroughly in the northern Gaza Strip, and we are also doing it now in the southern Gaza Strip"". An IDF spokesman later confirmed Israel ""continues to expand the ground incursion"" across all of Gaza, including troops ""conducting face to face battles with terrorists"". Since a week-long ceasefire ended on Friday, Israel has resumed a large-scale bombing campaign on Gaza, which residents of Khan Younis have described as the heaviest wave of attacks so far. The seven-day truce saw Hamas release 110 hostages being held in Gaza in return for 240 Palestinians being released from Israeli prisons. On Sunday morning, the Israeli army issued evacuation orders for several districts of Khan Younis, urging people to leave immediately. Israeli authorities believe members of the Hamas leadership are hiding in the city, where hundreds of thousands of people have been sheltering after fleeing fighting in the north in the early stages of the war. A UN official has described a ""degree of panic"" he has not seen before in a Gaza hospital, after the Israeli military shifted the focus of its offensive to the south. James Elder, from the children's agency Unicef, described Nasser Medical Hospital in Khan Younis as a ""warzone"". An adviser to Israel's prime minister said Israel is making ""maximum effort"" to avoid killing civilians. Mr Elder told the BBC he could hear constant large explosions close to the Nasser hospital and children were arriving with head injuries, terrible burns, and shrapnel from recent blasts. ""It's a hospital I've gone to regularly and the children know me now, the families know me now. Those same people are grabbing my hand, or grabbing my shirt saying 'please take us somewhere safe. Where is safe?'"" ""They are unfortunately asking a question to which the only answer is there is nowhere safe. And that includes for them, as they know, that hospital,"" he said. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 500 people have been killed since the bombing resumed. More than 15,500 people have been killed in the strip since the war began, the ministry also said. Mohammed Ghalayini, a British-Palestinian who has stayed in Gaza, said the situation in the city was ""beyond catastrophic"". ""People have been, for 50 days or more, withstanding brutal Israeli onslaught and are very low on all resources - food, water, power and the sanitation and the waste services,"" he told the BBC by phone, before the connection cut off. The air pollution expert, who normally lives in Manchester, arrived in Gaza for a three-month visit to see his mother shortly before the 7 October attacks. Israel began its retaliatory bombing of Gaza following Hamas's attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, which saw around 1,200 people killed and 240 taken hostage. Rockets have also been regularly fired at Israel from Gaza since fighting resumed on Friday. A 22-year-old man in the city of Holon, near Tel Aviv, was treated for minor shrapnel injuries on Saturday. Hundreds of thousands of people have already fled the fighting to take shelter in Khan Younis, after Israel told them to leave the north of the strip. The latest UN update says around 1.8 million people are internally displaced in Gaza. Speaking to the BBC, the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees chief, Filippo Grandi, said Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are being ""pushed more and more towards a narrow corner of what is already a very narrow territory"". The IDF has begun posting maps of areas set to be attacked online. It says these maps, along with other measures like phone calls and leaflets being dropped on Gaza by plane, will warn people to evacuate. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser Mark Regev said civilians are not targets and protecting them is made more difficult by Hamas ""embedding its military terror machine"" in civilian neighbourhoods. He says the IDF are trying to be ""as surgical as we can in a very difficult combat situation"", and has given advance warning of attacks. Separately, the IDF say they have destroyed 500 ""terror tunnel"" shafts used by Hamas in Gaza, out of the 800 they say have been found so far. It also said around 10,000 air strikes on ""terror targets"" have been carried out by the air force ""under the guidance of IDF soldiers on the ground"" since the war began.",2023-12-03T20:45:25.000Z

Israel-Gaza: UK launches surveillance flights to find Hamas hostagesPublished2 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The UK will carry out unarmed surveillance flights over the Middle East to search for Hamas hostage locations, the Ministry of Defence says. The flights will help gather intelligence on potential hostage whereabouts. Five British nationals are missing and the UK government has not said how many could be held by Hamas. ""The safety of British nationals is our utmost priority,"" the MoD said. ""In support of the ongoing hostage rescue activity, the Ministry of Defence will conduct surveillance flights over the eastern Mediterranean, including operating in air space over Israel and Gaza."" It added that the aircraft will be unarmed and will be tasked solely to locate hostages. ""Only information relating to hostage rescue will be passed to the relevant authorities responsible for hostage rescue."" The aircraft will includeShadow R1s, which the Royal Air Force use for intelligence gathering, ministry officials said. Information on the potential locations of hostages will be shared with Israel. More than 130 captives are thought to be in Gaza. The Pentagon saidunarmed UAV droneshad been deployed over Gaza in ""support of hostage recovery efforts"", earlier this month. ""The US is conducting unarmed UAV flights over Gaza, as well as providing advice and assistance to support our Israeli partner as they work on their hostage recovery efforts,"" the Pentagon said. Fighting resumed on Friday after a week-long truce in Gaza. The IDF said it had hit more than 400 Hamas targets on the first day. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 193 people have been killed in the latest wave of Israeli attacks.

Israel-Gaza war: Residents of Khan Younis say Israeli strikes heaviest since start of warPublished2 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel has carried out intense air strikes on Khan Younis in southern Gaza, with residents describing it as the heaviest bombing of the war. People in eastern areas of the city have been told by the Israeli military to evacuate further to the south. Israel believes some Hamas leaders are in the city, where many civilians are sheltering after fleeing the north. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 193 people have been killed in the latest wave of Israeli attacks. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) resumed its offensive against Hamas in Gaza, launched in response to the 7 October attacks in Israel which killed around 1,200 people. The Hamas-run health ministry says the number of people killed in Gaza has now exceeded 15,200 people. Israel's bombardment of Gaza resumed after a temporary ceasefire ended on Friday. The IDF said it had hit more than 400 Hamas ""terror targets"" on the first day of the renewed operation. Rockets have also been regularly fired at Israel from Gaza since fighting resumed, including a barrage aimed at Tel Aviv and the surrounding area of central Israel on Saturday evening. Following this attack, Israel's ambulance service said it treated a 22-year-old man for ""minor shrapnel injuries"" to the head in Holon - a city just south of Tel Aviv. At a briefing on Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to continue with the Israeli military operation until ""we achieve all the goals"" in eliminating Hamas and securing the release of the hostages. He acknowledged that ""a tough war is ahead of us"". Khan Younis and the city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, were some of the places hit with heavy air strikes, with the next phase of the offensive likely to focus on southern Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter in the area, after being told to flee the north of the territory, which was Israel's main target in the early stages of the war. The IDF's Arabic-language spokesman posted maps on social media indicating which areas civilians should leave, directing people in areas east of Khan Younis to evacuate further south to shelters in Rafah, an indication that a ground offensive could be imminent. Hospitals, operating with limited resources after weeks of fighting, were overwhelmed with casualties, and at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, some patients were treated on the floor. ""A night of horror,"" Samira, a mother of four, told the Reuters news agency. ""It was one of the worst nights we spent in Khan Younis in the past six weeks since we arrived here... We are so afraid they will enter Khan Younis."" Unicef spokesman James Elder, who was in Khan Younis on Saturday, told the BBC that hospitals were already ""saturated"" with casualties before the strikes resumed. ""There is literally blood in the corridors, there are mothers yet again holding babies who look like they've been killed"", he said. The Palestinian Red Crescent charity confirmed 100 lorries with aid were allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt on Saturday. On Friday, no humanitarian supplies were delivered to the territory. Talks to reach a deal for another temporary ceasefire and to secure the release of the people kidnapped on 7 October who remain in Gaza collapsed on Saturday. A Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that the negotiations were completely stalled, with no contacts or attempts to reach a fresh truce. On Saturday, Israel announced it was pulling its negotiators from the Mossad intelligence service out of talks in Qatar, which has been acting as a mediator, following an ""impasse in the negotiations"". Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas's political bureau, told Al Jazeera on Saturday that ""there are no negotiations now"" and there would be no more prisoners exchanged with Israel until the war is over. US Vice President Kamala Harris, in a meeting with the president of Egypt, said ""under no circumstances [would] the United States permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, the besiegement of Gaza, or the redrawing of the borders of Gaza"". She also reiterated the US position that Israel had the right to defend itself. During their meeting in Dubai on the sidelines of the UN's COP28 climate conference, she told Abdul Fattah al-Sisi that peace efforts could only succeed if ""pursued in the context of a clear political horizon for the Palestinian people towards a state of their own led by a revitalized Palestinian Authority"". At Saturday's briefing, Mr Netanyahu praised the release of 110 Israeli hostages - women and children - as well as some foreigners. ""Welcome back from hell,"" Mr Netanyahu said. The hostages were released in exchange for the freeing of 240 Palestinian prisoners - women and teenagers. Most of the about 140 captives remaining in Gaza are men and military personnel.",2023-12-02T20:42:26.000Z

"Protester sets themself on fire outside Israel consulate in Atlanta, GeorgiaPublished2 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","A protester is in a critical condition after lighting themself on fire at the Israeli consulate in the US state of Georgia in what police called an ""extreme act of political protest"". Police said the demonstrator used petrol, and a Palestinian flag was found at the scene, outside the mission in Atlanta. The person's gender and age remain unclear. A security guard who attempted to intervene was also injured. According to police, the protester arrived at the facility at 12:17 local time (17:17 GMT). ""We believe this building remains safe and we do not see any threat here,"" Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said. ""We believe this was an act of political protest."" The guard suffered burns to the wrist and leg, Atlanta Fire Chief Roderick Smith told reporters. Both the protester and the guard were taken to a local hospital. In a statement, the consul general of Israel to the south-east US, Anat Sultan-Dadon, said that the diplomatic mission is ""saddened to learn of the self-immolation at the entrance to the office building"". ""It is tragic to see the hate and incitement toward Israel expressed in such a horrific way,"" she added. ""The sanctity of life is our highest value. Our prayers are with the security officer who was injured while trying to prevent this tragic act"". Fighting resumed between Israel and Hamas on Friday morning after a seven-day ceasefire between the two sides. The Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October killed 1,200 people, with about 240 others taken hostage. Nearly 15,000 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory operation in Gaza, according to its Hamas-run health ministry. The war has prompted hundreds of protests - in support of both Palestinians and Israelis - across the US. US officials have warned of a rise in both antisemitic and Islamophobic hate speech since the conflict began. On 16 November, police arrested a suspect in the death of a Jewish man in California following a clash between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protesters. The victim, 69-year-old  Paul Kessler, fell during a dispute at the rally and died the following day.

Bowen: US sets clearer red lines for Israel as ceasefire endsPublished2 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"In the end it was a diplomatic achievement that the ceasefire lasted as long as it did. Now, after a seven-day pause, Israel and Hamas are facing their greatest military and political challenges. For Hamas, it is the fight to survive. As long as a Hamas gunman can pull a trigger or launch a rocket into Israel it will claim to be undefeated. For all its overwhelming military power, Israel's task is more complicated. Its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swore ""mighty vengeance"" after Hamas breached the border and killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, on 7 October. In the first hours after the Israeli military went back on the offensive, the government recommitted itself to its war aims in a WhatsApp post: ""Releasing the hostages, eliminating Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to the residents of Israel."" How it does that and what happens next are now the number one preoccupations of Mr Netanyahu, his political allies and enemies in Israel and Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state who has made four trips to Israel and the region since the war started. Perhaps Mr Blinken knew that his attempt to prolong what he called the ""humanitarian pause"" would fail. On the evening before the fighting resumed, he repeated America's support for Israel's right to defend itself, and once again condemned Hamas. Mr Blinken repeated his insistence ""that Israel act in accordance with international humanitarian law and the laws of war, even when confronting a terrorist group that respects neither"". Then Mr Blinken made his starkest public statement yet about how Israel should fight the war. It is worth quoting at length, because it is a checklist of what the US expects from its closest ally. Mr Blinken said that it meant ""taking more effective steps to protect the lives of civilians, including by clearly and precisely designating areas and places in southern and central Gaza where they can be safe and out of the line of fire"". ""It means avoiding further significant displacement of civilians inside of Gaza.  It means avoiding damage to life-critical infrastructure, like hospitals, like power stations, like water facilities."" ""And it means giving civilians who've been displaced to southern Gaza the choice to return to the north as soon as conditions permit.  There must be no enduring internal displacement."" At the beginning of the war Joe Biden, the US president, came here. While trying to wrap Israel in a warm and powerful embrace he also warned his allies not to be blinded by rage as they sought justice, as America had been after the al-Qaeda attacks of 11 September, 2001. Mr Blinken's remarks suggest Joe Biden believes that Mr Netanyahu, with whom he has had a difficult relationship, did not listen. Israel's war aims require that the next phase of its offensive is aimed at Hamas in southern Gaza. When it invaded northern Gaza, it ordered Palestinian civilians to head to the south for their own safety. While not as lethal as the north, much of which Israel has turned into a wasteland, nowhere in Gaza is safe. A few hours after hostilities resumed, Palestinians in Rafah, in the far south of Gaza on the border with Egypt, were being killed in Israeli air strikes. Israel cannot claim to have eliminated Hamas without destroying its infrastructure in the south, where it believes Yahya Sinwar and the other leaders are lying low in tunnels under the civilian population, along with an unspecified number of fighting men. If Israel is going to use the same tactics as it did in northern Gaza, thousands more civilians will be killed. Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, already calls the plight of the people of Gaza ""an epic humanitarian catastrophe"". Egypt, and others, fear that extreme military pressure on approaching two million civilians in the south could mean thousands of desperate people forcing their way over the border into the Sinai Desert. A new Palestinian refugee crisis would be another dangerous and desperate moment for the Middle East. Let us assume that Israel has promised the US that Palestinian civilians will be told to move to specific areas where they will be safe. In a high-intensity war of the kind that Israel has been waging, with tanks, air strikes and heavy artillery, it is far easier to see how that plan might go wrong, rather than how it might succeed. If Israel shifts to lighter counter-insurgency tactics, with troops moving without a blanket of heavy protection, it will most likely suffer many more battle casualties than it has so far. Israel's next moves are also a significant moment for Joe Biden, who is facing strident criticism of his support for Israel from the progressive wing of his own Democratic party. Biden's chief diplomat, Antony Blinken, has spoken clearly, in public, about the way the US wants Israel to fight Hamas. If Israel kills anything like as many Palestinian civilians as it did in the north, in defiance of the stated will of Joe Biden, the US president will have to decide whether he can continue to give Israel so much support, not just on the battlefield but also in the United Nations Security Council, where the US has used its veto many times to protect Israel. Hamas is not beaten. Its remaining hostages give it a powerful lever that it can use to disrupt Israel's military campaign, and to inflict more psychological pressure on the home front. The Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his men will also try to exploit opportunities that open up if and when Israel's generals follow American instructions to use less firepower. This war is in a new phase. So is the whole region. Many Palestinians and Israelis, including those far from the battles in Gaza, seem beaten down by the weight of a dangerous and uncertain future.",2023-12-02T00:59:38.000Z

'I’m not ready to lose hope': The hostages still in GazaPublished1 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"""She doesn't deserve to wait for the next deal, just because she's not somebody's mother or grandmother,"" writes Or Neko Maymon on Facebook in Hebrew. Or is talking about 27-year-old street artist and art student Inbar Haiman, who is his partner's sister. Inbar was kidnapped by Hamas from the Supernova music festival in Israel on 7 October, and was seen days later in a hostage video circulated on social media, with blood on her face. She is one of 16 women BBC Verify has identified as still being captive in Gaza, following a seven-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. This pause in fighting saw Hamas agree to release 110 hostages (including 78 women and children), in return for 240 Palestinian prisoners being freed from Israeli jails. Israel's focus on securing the release of female hostages has raised and dashed hopes for the families of the women who are still left behind. Since her kidnap, Inbar's friends and family have been campaigning for her release, and using the hashtag #FreePink, a reference to her street artist name. ""I'm really not ready for you to take away my hope to see Inbar come back,"" Or wrote in another post three days ago. In November, Inbar's boyfriend, 24-year-old Noam Alon, camped for 10 days in front of the central military headquarters in Tel Aviv, calling for the Israeli government to do more to secure Inbar's release. Of the 237 people taken hostage by Hamas and five other armed Palestinian groups during the 7 October attacks, BBC News has verified that 115 are left in Gaza. An Israeli government spokesman says 135 people remain captive. There is no official published list of hostages, so the BBC has had to confirm names itself. Among the remaining hostages are at least 16 women and 95 men. This number includes French-Mexican Orión Hernández Radoux, the boyfriend of 22-year-old Shani Louk, who waskilled after being kidnappedfrom the Supernova musical festival. Soon after the festival was attacked, a video began circulating widely on social media showing the body of a young woman being paraded through the streets. Shani's family was able to identify her in the footage from her dreadlocks and distinctive tattoos. At the end of October, Shani's mother Ricarda said she had been told by the Israeli military that a piece of skull bone belonging to her daughter had been found. Shani's body has not yet been recovered. In November, her boyfriend Orión turned 31 in captivity. ""Today is Orión's birthday,"" wrote family friend Gabriel De la Fuente on Facebook in Spanish, ""already a month since his kidnapping, may God return you well."" Orión is believed to have been snatched at the festival, and the Sun newspaper says it has seen threatening messages written in Arabic sent from his phone. His friends and family join together in prayer each night at 7pm, in a WhatsApp group created to help them support each other. ""Only by uniting together in prayer will we provide the spiritual strength and support that your soul needs right now, wherever it may be,"" writes Gabriel. Families waiting for loved ones to come home have become a great source of support to each other, says Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat has been captive since 7 October. ""We became like a real large family of families,"" he told the BBC News channel. ""It feels as though, when their relatives are getting released, so are mine."" Carmel, a 39-year-old occupational therapist from Tel Aviv, had been visiting parents in Be'eri on 7 October. Her sister in law, Yarden Roman-Gat, wasreleased by Hamason Wednesday, and reunited with her husband and three-year-old daughter. ""I wasn't even sure that she was alive until I saw her,"" Gil says of Yarden. When the 36-year-old German-Israeli, her husband and daughter were captured, they managed to break out of the gunmen's car near the Gaza-Israel barrier, Gil explains. The family then began to run away while being shot at. Realising she couldn't run fast enough, Yarden gave her daughter to her husband and surrendered so that the others could make their escape. ""We were very, very happy to see her,"" says Gil. But now the ceasefire is over, Gil grows more and more scared for his cousin Carmel, who has not yet come home. ""We were very, very worried by the fact that the truce is ended,"" Gil says. ""I'm personally very worried for her."" Many people whose loved ones remain hostages in Gaza have been using social media to campaign for their release, share feelings and support each other in grief. The mother of dual US-Israeli hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin has been posting videos of herself talking about her son on his family's Bring Hersh Home Facebook page. ""I wanted to share with you what happened last night when I woke up at 2:13 in the morning,"" Rachel told the Facebook page's 17,000 followers on Wednesday. ""I started to think about how much pain Hersh must be in."" According to eye witnesses Rachel spoke with, Hersh lost half of his arm in a grenade explosion before he was kidnapped from the Supernova festival. Eyewitness accounts say the 23-year-old was seen being forced onto a white pick-up truck. The last-known signal from his phone came from just inside Gaza. ""It is really important that we get him home so that he can start the process of learning how to live his life in a very different way than he ever lived it before,"" says Rachel in one of her latest videos. ""It's just another reason why we are tenaciously and tirelessly fighting for him to come home."" Additional reporting by Emma Pengelly.",2023-12-01T21:35:04.000Z

Gaza's fear and anger as ceasefire ends and fighting eruptsPublished1 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The resumption of fighting between Israel and Hamas has been met with a mixture of fear and anger in Gaza, with the UN calling it a ""nightmare"". A temporary ceasefire expired at 07:00 (05:00 GMT) with both warring sides blaming each other. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 178 people have been killed in Israeli attacks. A UN official said much-needed aid had stopped coming through the Rafah crossing since the ceasefire ended. On Friday morning, the sound of heavy gunfire could be heard in areas of northern Gaza infiltrated by the Israeli military, with clashes breaking out between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters. There seemed to be no let up in the pace of fighting after the ceasefire, with jet fighters and reconnaissance planes deployed. Areas targeted by air strikes included north-western Gaza and Khan Younis in the south - where hundreds of thousands of people fled earlier in the war to escape fighting in the north. Houses in the city were targeted - including one house in close proximity to Nasser hospital, where the BBC Arabic team was based. ""Around 06:30 the drones started flying,"" Mohammad Ghalaiyini, a Briton who is currently in Khan Younis with his family, said in a voice message sent to the BBC. ""Around 07:30, I think, the bombings started and there's been like non-stop bombing every 10, 15, 20 minutes."" Leaflets dropped by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned that areas east of Khan Younis and Salah al-Din were ""dangerous"" combat zones and urged people in some parts to head to shelters further south in Rafah, close to the Egyptian border. Meanwhile, Hamas and other groups fired rockets at Israel, which deployed its Iron Dome defence system to intercept them. The renewed clashes were ""catastrophic for the people of Gaza,"" James Elder, a spokesman for the UN children's agency, Unicef, told the BBC. Mr Elder said Nasser hospital - which he said was now Gaza's biggest functioning medical facility - was ""wildly overflowing with children and people with wounds of war recovering from the last attack"". He said many families had been sleeping on mattresses at the hospital for weeks. ""This hospital cannot possibly cope with a surge in wounds from the battlefield with more children with burns, with those horrendous shrapnel injuries,"" he said. Other UN aid agencies have described similar conditions at other hospitals. The situation at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was ""like a horror movie"" even before the bombing started again, World Health Organization (WHO) senior emergency officer Rob Holden said. His team - who visited the site earlier in the week - reported patients with ""the most horrific injuries"" lying on floors ""running with blood"", while the bodies of those who had been killed were lined up in the car park outside. The WHO says only 18 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are ""minimally to partially functional"". ""Gaza's health system has been crippled by the ongoing hostilities,"" Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories, said. ""We are extremely concerned about the resumption of violence."" There is also major concern over the wider humanitarian situation in Gaza, which is likely to worsen as fighting resumes. As supplies of cooking gas, food and water are dangerously low, shops are empty and there is not enough aid to distribute to displaced people. Many are sleeping in tents and have told the BBC they are struggling to cope with the cold weather conditions. They are desperately urging for more aid including warm clothing to be delivered. They also say very little water, food and medicine is reaching hospitals. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN's relief agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said he wasbeyond mere concernthat ""no humanitarian aid has been allowed into Gaza today including fuel"". Hundreds of trucks carrying aid were able to enter Gaza during the seven-day ceasefire but they were still fewer in number than the roughly 500 trucks that entered Gaza every day before the war. On Friday Mark Regev, senior adviser to the Israeli prime minister, said Hamas could have ensured the pause in fighting was extended if they had freed more hostages. ""They have close to 20 women [eligible for release] in the framework of the existing agreement, yet they chose not to do so,"" Mr Regev told the BBC. Asked whether those women were civilians or Israeli soldiers, Mr Regev said some of the women were in their 20s and had finished their military service. For its part, Hamas says it did make several offers regarding further hostage releases - all of which were rejected by Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its military strikes on Friday had hit Hamas command centres, underground sites and groups of Hamas fighters. Officials in Gaza say more than 14,800 people including about 6,000 children have been killed since Israel began its military campaign against Hamas there, with thousands more believed to be dead under rubble. It follows Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October during which it killed about 1,200 people and kidnapped 240 others.",2023-12-01T19:07:37.000Z

Manchester scientist in Gaza 'terrified' after breakdown of ceasefirePublished1 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A scientist sheltering in a city in Gaza has said he is ""terrified"" for his family's safety after the breakdown of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Mohammed Ghalayini, who lives in Manchester, chose to stay in Khan Yunis to be with his mother and sister. Fighting has resumed in Gaza after the seven-day temporaryceasefire between Israel and Hamas expired. Mr Ghalayini said warning leaflets telling people to leave Khan Yunis were ""very ominous and scary"". The British-Palestinian dual national was visiting his relatives when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,300 people, and hasremained with familythrough repeated air strikes. He said he was devastated by the end of the ceasefire. ""Today, immediately around seven, the bombing returned and there was like repeated bombing for three hours, artillery and airstrikes and naval artillery as well,"" the 44-year-old said. During the pause in fighting, he said he had an ""idyllic"" time and cycled to a nearby beach, picked olives, visited friends and collected a large water container to help ensure his family's water supply. Mr Ghalayini said he had hoped the ceasefire would lead to greater de-escalation, but was terrified after leaflets dropped over Khan Yunis told residents they must leave to go to Rafah as the city was a ""dangerous combat zone"". The scientist said he feared Israel was planning to ""corral as many Gazans as possible into as smaller area as possible close to the border"" and move them permanently into nearby Egypt. About 25 people are currently staying in Mr Ghalayini's aunt's house in Khan Yunis, with more expected to join them. He said: ""People are just being pushed further and further, bit by bit, by this relentless Israeli military campaign."" The Israeli Defence Force said its only purpose in dropping leaflets telling people to head for Rafah was to minimise civilian casualties. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,XandInstagram?

Israel-Gaza: Londoner loses 42 family membersPublished1 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Palestinian woman who lost 42 relatives in a Gaza bomb strike has said she wants to bring her surviving loved ones to safety in London. Khitam Attaallah Elian, from west London, was told more than half of her relatives had been killed in the middle of the night when her sister's home was destroyed. Her sister-in-law, two nieces and nephew survived. Mrs Attaallah Elian has now flown to Egypt to help as much as she can. Recalling the night she was told of their deaths in the bombing on 21 November, Mrs Attaallah Elian told the BBC: ""My daughter came to my room and turned on the light. She said, 'Mama, Aunt Ayah's house has been bombed'. ""I couldn't understand the news and started screaming. My daughter and husband tried to calm me down and I was asking, 'All of them? All of them?'"" Her family were among the first to leave their homes in Gaza since the outbreak of the most recent Israel-Gaza conflict. They moved to her sister's house in the Al- Nuseirat area of central Gaza.

Why has the Gaza ceasefire come to an end?Published1 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Fighting resumed between Israel and Hamas on Friday morning, ending a seven-day ceasefire between the two sides that had seen hostages and prisoners released and much-needed humanitarian assistance reaching the Gaza Strip. Here's a look at some of the key questions around the latest developments. An hour before the ceasefire was due to end at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT), the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that sirens were sounding for communities close to the Gaza Strip - it then said it had intercepted a rocket fired from the enclave. An hour later, Israel's military said fighting had resumed, accusing Hamas of violating the terms of the agreement. The IDF then said its fighter jets were striking Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip. Shortly after, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas had not ""met its obligation to release all of the women hostages today and has launched rockets at Israeli citizens"". However, Hamas blamed Israel for the resumption in fighting, saying it refused ""to accept all offers to release other hostages"". ""The occupation had a prior decision to resume the criminal aggression,"" it said in a statement, blaming US President Joe Biden for ""the continuation of Zionist war crimes in the Gaza Strip"" and ""giving the green light to Israel"". Throughout the week-long ceasefire, Mr Netanyahu has come under pressure, particularly from right-wing elements in his government, to re-start the war - something Israel has continually made clear it intended to do once the agreement had come to an end. Despite this, there are still hopes that a new agreement could be reached. Qatar, which has played a crucial role so far in negotiations over a ceasefire, confirmed on Friday that talks were continuing ""with the aim of returning to a pause"". Within seven hours of the fighting resuming, the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 60 people had been killed, adding to the nearly 15,000 Palestinians it said were killed before the ceasefire. James Elder from Unicef, the UN children's agency, spoke to the BBC from a hospital in southern Gaza after the bombing started, describing the situation as ""terrifying"". He said it was ""horrendous for people"" and that ""you see the fear on their faces"", adding that a strike had hit close to the facility he was in. He described the end of the ceasefire as ""the nightmare that everyone utterly feared"". Before the ceasefire, the Gaza Strip had undergone widespread destruction as Israel conducted its retaliatory campaign in response to Hamas's deadly 7 October attacks. Israel claimed to have used more than 10,000 bombs and missiles, andBBC analysis found that almost 98,000 buildingsin Gaza may have suffered damage, with most concentrated in the north. The strikes also brought humanitarian aid to a halt. Aid agencies were able to use the pause in fighting to get crucial assistance in, but reported finding devastation in many of the areas they reached. Although negotiations continue in the hope of a new deal being reached, for now it's clear that the war has resumed. After weeks of intense fighting in the north of the Gaza Strip - particularly around Gaza City - Israel's military now appears to be focussing much of its attention on the south, where renewed air strikes have been reported. The IDF has alsocreated a map of Gazadivided into more than 2,000 zones, which it said will be used to help people in Gaza escape future fighting. It said the map is split into areas to enable people to ""evacuate from specific places for their safety if required"". On Friday, Israeli jets dropped leaflets over areas east and north of Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, linking to the map. The flyers did not refer to any of the numbered blocks, but a message in Arabic told residents in four named - but not numbered - areas to ""evacuate immediately and go to shelters in Rafah"". The renewed fighting comes after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli officials, where he insisted the next stage of the war must ensure civilians are protected. Mr Blinken said hehad told the Israeli government that it must avoid further mass displacement of Palestinians and damage to critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, power stations and water facilities. During the seven-day ceasefire, Hamasagreed to release 110 people from Gaza, including 78 Israeli women and children. As part of the deal, 240 Palestinians were also released from Israeli jails. They had been accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to incitement and attempted murder. Many of the Palestinians released had not been convicted of crimes, and were being held on remand while awaiting trial. Somesaid they had been subjected to abuseand collective punishment after the 7 October attacks. Israel says all its prisoners are detained according to the law. It is estimated that about 140 Israeli hostages remain in captivity in Gaza.",2023-12-01T12:40:25.000Z

"Nearly 100,000 Gaza buildings may be damaged, satellite images showPublished1 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Satellite images commissioned by the BBC reveal the extent of destruction across Gaza, showing that nearly 98,000 buildings may have suffered damage. The satellite images were taken last Thursday - before the start of a seven-day suspension of hostilities, which has now ended. Drone footage and verified video also show buildings and entire neighbourhoods reduced to rubble after Israeli air strikes and on-the-ground fighting. While northern Gaza has been the focus of the Israeli offensive and has borne the brunt of the destruction, widespread damage extends across the entire strip. Israel says northern Gaza, which includes the major urban centre of Gaza City, was a ""centre of gravity of Hamas"", the group behind the deadly 7 October attacks on Israel.The Israeli military says its bombing campaign has successfully targeted Hamas commanders and fighters and accuses the group of embedding itself in civilian areas. Satellite data analysis suggests that almost 98,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip may have suffered damage, mostly in the north - as shown in the above map. Analysis of the data was carried out by Corey Scher of City University of New York Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University. It is based on comparisons of two separate images, revealing changes in the height or structure of buildings which suggests damage. We have analysed satellite imagery from several areas with extensive damage. The cities of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun in the north and north-east of the Gaza Strip were among the first to be targeted by air strikes after the 7 October attacks by Hamas. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the area was a hideout for Hamas. Parts of Beit Lahia, which overlooked olive groves and sand dunes stretching towards the border with Israel, were flattened. The satellite image below shows an area in the north-east of Beit Lahia, where a significant block of buildings was destroyed. Bulldozers appear to have cleared roads through the rubble and the Israeli military cleared land and set up defensive positions in surrounding fields. The IDF also struck the small nearby city of Beit Hanoun, less than 1.6km (1 mile) from the border. It said 120 targets were hit in the area on the first day of air strikes. As the images above show, a skyline of multi-storey buildings and a mosquewas gradually reduced to rubble between 14 October and 22 November. After weeks of air strikes on Gaza, Israel moved in on the ground - tanks and bulldozers going through areas which had been heavily bombarded. The IDF worked its way southwards along the coast towards Shati (Beach) refugee camp, in the Gaza City area. As the image below shows, a whole series of craters are visible in what was once a residential area. Some of the buildings on the beach front, which boasted Gaza's first five-star hotel, the Al-Mashtal, as well as huts and restaurants, appear to have been partially destroyed. About a week after the air strikes began, the IDF warned Palestinians in northern Gaza to move south of a river known as Wadi Gaza for their own safety. Despite the warning and hundreds of thousands of people fleeing Gaza City, areas in the south continued to be targeted. Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza was hit several times before the temporary pause in hostilities began. The camp was said to be home to about 85,000 people, according to the UN. In this verified video, which emergedonline, people are seen picking through the rubble of collapsed and damaged buildings. The distinctive black chimney stacks of the Gaza Power Plant, situated just north of the camp, are visible in the background. The BBC has approached the IDF for comment. In Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, thousands of people are living in tents or the rubble of bombed-out buildings. Although the damage was not as widespread as in the north, up to 15% of buildings across the city may have been damaged, according to Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek's analysis. As well as pushing down from the north, Israeli forces also cut across the Gaza Strip westwards, isolating Gaza City from the south. In this image below, taken to the south of Gaza City, we can see that a previously populated residential area was cleared by the IDF with heavy machinery and a road bulldozed towards the western Mediterranean shoreline. You can also see dozens of military vehicles, including tanks, grouped behind fortifications made from earth. Satellite images also show an open square of land with a Star of David carved into the earth by vehicle tracks in Gaza City, near al-Azhar University. Images online from before the war showed children playing there and suggested it was a park, but IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the ground was used by Hamas as a parade square near a base. The area was taken over by the IDF's Golani Brigade. A Star of David - which is used as a Jewish and Israeli symbol - was made by armoured vehicles in a ceremony in memory of Israeli soldiers who had been killed since the war began, according to a post by Rear Adm Hagari on X.

Palestinian man criticises Israeli prison as 30 more freedPublished1 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Palestinian man has described his time inside an Israeli prison as ""not normal"", after 30 more prisoners were released under the truce with Hamas. Younis Hawamdeh told Reuters news agency the unnamed facility had been a ""tragedy"" but did not elaborate. Israelhas saidall its prisoners are detained according to the law. Its prison service said on Thursday that it had freed more Palestinians, hours after Hamas let eight more hostages go. The releases brought the totals freed to 105 hostages and 240 Palestinian prisoners. A Red Cross bus carrying the 30 Palestinians arrived in Ramallah, in the West Bank, late on Thursday, as has been customary for each of the seven exchanges. It was there that Reuters spoke to a handful of newly freed prisoners. One, Ali Askara, said detainees had been ""tortured ...  psychologically, physically, everything"". ""They beat us, there were people with bleeding eyes,"" he was quoted as saying. Another man, Abdallah Al Bao, said he hoped the remaining prisoners would be released soon. A full list of those freed is yet to be shared by Israeli prison authorities, who havespoken to the BBC's Lucy Williamsonabout abuse claims made by other freed Palestinians. Images from Thursday showed emotional reunions between Palestinians and their friends and family. In one, a mother cries as she hugs her returned son, while the crowd around them applaud. Another shows people, who have climbed on top of the bus, waving Hamas flags.",2023-12-01T04:49:02.000Z

Released Palestinians allege abuse in Israeli jailsPublished1 December 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails say that guards carried out abuse and collective punishment in the weeks after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October. They have described being hit with sticks, having muzzled dogs set on them, and their clothes, food and blankets taken away. One female prisoner has said she was threatened with rape, and that guards twice tear-gassed inmates inside the cells. The BBC spoke to six people in total, all of whom said they were beaten before leaving jail. The Palestinian Prisoners Society says some guards are alleged to have urinated on handcuffed prisoners. And that six prisoners have died in Israeli custody in the past seven weeks. Israel says all its prisoners are detained according to the law. Eighteen-year-old Mohammed Nazzal was one of those released by Israel this week, in exchange for Israeli women and children held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. He had been held in custody in Nafha Prison without charge since August, and says he does not know why he was arrested. Mohammed invited me to his home, down a winding alley in the village of Qabatiya near Jenin, in the north of the occupied West Bank. The family reception room at the top of the old house was fogged by the smoke of a dozen cigarettes - a cousin circled the visitors with a flask of coffee and a tall tower of tiny paper cups. Mohammed sat flanked by rows of male relatives, both his hands heavily bandaged, held up in front of him stiffly like a boxer, the tip of his thumbs peeking out. Ten days ago, he says, Israeli prison guards came into his cell with a microphone and speaker, and tried to provoke the prisoners by clapping and screaming their names. ""When they saw we weren't reacting,"" he says, ""they started to beat us."" ""They arranged us so that the elderly prisoners were put in the back and the young in front. They took me and started beating me. I was trying to protect my head, and they were trying to break my legs and my hands."" The family showed us medical reports and X-rays from Palestinian doctors in Ramallah who examined Mohammed after he was released on Monday. We showed the X-ray pictures to two doctors in the UK, who confirmed that they showed fractures in both hands. It was no surprise to Mohammed. ""In the beginning, I was in a lot of pain,"" he tells me. ""Then after a while, I knew that they were broken, so I stopped using them. I only used them when I went to the toilet."" He says the other prisoners helped him eat, drink and use the bathroom, and that he did not ask the guards for medical help out of fear that he would be beaten again. The Israel Prison Service has disputed Mohammed's story, saying that he had been examined by a medic before leaving prison, with no medical problem diagnosed. The prison service also released a video of the teenager leaving prison and boarding a Red Cross bus before his release, which it says proves that his claims are false. In the footage, the teenager's hands are unbandaged, and appear to be hanging by his sides - including as he climbs onto the bus - but are out of shot for most of the video. Mohammed told us that the first medical treatment he received was on that Red Cross bus. A medical report from a hospital in Ramallah the day he arrived back home advised that a plate might have to be fitted, if his fractures did not heal by themselves. We asked the Red Cross to confirm Mohammed's story. They said in a statement: ""We speak directly with the detaining authorities if we have any concerns about the medical condition of detainees. Due to this dialogue, we do not speak publicly about individual cases."" Mohammed says the behaviour of guards inside Israeli jails changed after the Hamas attacks on 7 October. He says guards kicked them, and used sticks to hit them, and describes one guard stepping on his face. ""They came in with their dogs,"" he continues. ""They let the dogs attack us and then they started beating us."" ""They took out mattresses, our clothes, our pillows, and they threw our food on the floor. People were terrified."" He shows me the marks on his back and shoulder that he says were the result of these beatings. ""The dog attacking me wore a muzzle with very sharp edges - his muzzle and claws left marks all over my body,"" he tells me. Beatings like this happened twice at Megiddo Prison, he says, and more times than he could count at Nafha Prison. Other Palestinian prisoners we have spoken to have described a similar shift inside Israel's jails after the Hamas attacks, saying they understood it as ""revenge"" against Palestinian prisoners for the actions of Hamas. The head of the Palestinian Prisoners Society, Abdullah al-Zaghary, told us that many prisoners had witnessed cellmates being violently beaten on their faces and bodies, and that he had heard allegations of guards urinating on handcuffed prisoners. We asked the Israel Prison Service for a response to these allegations. They said all prisoners were detained according to the law and had all the basic rights legally required. ""We are not aware of the claims you described,"" the statement said. ""Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined by official authorities."" Lama Khater, released from prison earlier this week, published a video on social media alleging that an intelligence officer had ""explicitly threatened her with rape"" immediately after her arrest in late October. ""I was handcuffed and blindfolded,"" she told an interviewer in the video. ""They threatened to rape me... It was clear the goal was to intimidate me."" Israel said these claims were made by her lawyer and had been denied by the prisoner herself. The prison service had filed a complaint for incitement, it said. But Lama Khater told us by telephone that women prisoners - including herself - had indeed been threatened with rape, and that tear gas had been used against prisoners in their dormitory at Damon Prison. The Palestinian Prisoners Society says there has been a sharp rise in the number of Palestinian deaths in custody since the 7 October attacks, with six people dying in jail since that date. Israel did not address our question about this directly, but said that four prisoners had died on four different dates over the past weeks, and that the prison service had no knowledge of the causes of death. In Qabatiya village, Mohammed Nazzal says his hands still give him pain, especially at night. His brother Mutaz told me the teenager he knew before had not returned from jail. ""This is not the Mohammed we know,"" he said. ""He was brave, courageous. Now his heart is broken and filled with terror."" The previous night, he said, the Israeli army had carried out an operation in the city of Jenin, 4km (2.5 miles) away: ""You could see how scared he was.""

Three Israelis killed by Palestinian gunmen at Jerusalem bus stopPublished30 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Three Israelis were killed and several others injured when two Palestinian gunmen opened fire at a bus stop in West Jerusalem, Israeli police say. Video showed the gunmen getting out of a car on a highway and shooting at people - in an attack claimed by Hamas. Off-duty soldiers and a civilian at the scene killed the attackers, who police said were from occupied East Jerusalem. Local media said a fourth civilian who had mistaken for an attacker and shot by the troops died later died. In its statement saying that two assailants were its members, Hamas said Thursday morning's attack was a response to Israeli ""crimes"" in Gaza and elsewhere. Israel launched a major military campaign in Gaza after an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen almost eight weeks ago, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 15,000 people have been killed in the territory since the war began. A deal mediated by Qatar has led to a pause in the fighting in Gaza since last Friday. The Jerusalem attack came hours after the Palestinian armed group - which Israel, the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - agreed with Israel to extend a truce in Gaza for a seventh day, and to allow another exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Eight hostages were released from Gaza on Thursday. Two women -Mia Schem and Amit Soussana- were initially released, followed by a group of six others. Qatar - a key mediator in the deal - said two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday had been included in the following day's tally, meaning the expected number of 10 was reached. It reiterated that a further 30 Palestinians were due to be released from Israeli jails in return. Talks have continued in an effort to further prolong the pause in the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on his third trip to the Middle East since fighting broke out with Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October. In a press conference in Tel Aviv on Thursday evening, Mr Blinken called on Israel to put in place ""safe"" zones for Palestinian civilians in central and southern Gaza before resuming any military operations. The point, he said, was to ""minimise further casualties of innocent Palestinians"". Mr Blinken earlier commented on the attack in West Jerusalem, calling it a reminder ""of the threat from terrorism that Israel and Israelis face every single day"". Israeli President Isaac Herzog told his American visitor that the incident was another example of an ""endless war"" Israel was fighting in ""very complicated and challenging times"". In their account of the attack, Israeli police said they received reports of gunfire at Givat Shaul junction, on the main highway from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, at about 07:40 on Thursday (05:40 GMT). ""A car approached with two armed terrorists - one with an M16 rifle and the other with a handgun,"" Jerusalem District Commander Doron Turgeman told reporters at the scene. ""At a bus stop they opened fire at people who were waiting there,"" he said. ""The quick response of two soldiers and a civilian, who were close to the stop, neutralised the attackers."" A large amount of ammunition was later found by officers who searched the gunmen's vehicle. Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service paramedic Moshe Hemed rushed to the scene. ""I saw a number of casualties... Some were lying and some were walking. Along with large numbers of MDA teams we assessed and treated them,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, we had to pronounce a 24-year-old female deceased, and evacuated a further eight casualties in varying conditions to hospitals across the city."" Later, police announced that two other victims of the attack had died and that three more were in a serious condition in hospital. Israel media identified the 24-year-old woman as Livia Dickman, and the two others killed as Rabbi Elimelech Wasserman, 73, and Hana Ifergan, who was in her 60s. Late on Thursday evening, reports said a fourth civilian had died - after being fired on by soldiers who mistook him for an attacker himself. Haaretz reported that the unnamed civilian, in his 40s, was seen in security footage telling soldiers not to shoot, before he was shot. Israeli officials have not yet commented. Police said the attackers were two brothers in their 30s from the Sur Baher area of East Jerusalem. The Shin Bet security service named them as Murad and Ibrahim Namer, and said they were affiliated to Hamas and had previously served prison sentences for involvement in terrorist activities - according to Israeli media. Visiting the site of the attack, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said: ""Hamas is speaking with two voices here. ""This event proves again how we must not show weakness, that we must speak to Hamas only through the [rifle] scopes, only through the war."" Mr Ben-Gvir also said the Israeli government would continue to ease regulations for issuing gun licences to citizens. Hamas later confirmed that two members of its military wing had carried out the attack, calling it a ""natural response to unprecedented crimes conducted by the (Israeli) occupation"". It cited the killing of Palestinians in the Gaza war and during Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank, as well as the treatment of Palestinian prisoners. During Qatar-mediated truce,Hamas has freed dozens of Israeli women and children among its hostages, while Israel has released 210 Palestinian women and youths from its jails. Twenty-three Thai hostages and one Filipino have also been released as part of a separate deal between Hamas and the Egyptian government. Before the truce, four Israeli hostages had been released - and Israeli forces in Gaza had rescued one hostage and recovered the bodies of two others.",2023-11-30T22:45:08.000Z

Mia Schem: Wounded festival-goer in Hamas hostage video freedPublished30 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A wounded festival-goer is among the latest hostages released from Gaza - having appeared in a video by Hamas after its 7 October attack on Israel. Israeli-French tattoo artist Mia Schem, 21, was freed with another woman, followed later by six others. The seven-day truce has so far seen105 people released from Gaza. Israel is expected to release another 30 Palestinians prisoners on Thursday. Hamas took about 240 hostages, with many taken from the Supernova festival. Ms Schem was among them, and became the first person to appear in a Hamas hostage video on 16 October. Images on Thursday showed Schem being handed to humanitarian organisation the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) - along with Amit Soussana, a 40-year-old lawyer. Six others were released later the same day, including a pair of teenage siblings. Qatar - a key mediator in the deal - said two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday had been included in the following day's tally, meaning Thursday's expected number of 10 was reached. It reiterated that 30 more Palestinian prisoners were also set for release on Thursday under the deal. Advocacy group the Palestinian Prisoners Club earlier said they comprised 22 children and eight women. Meanwhile, mediators are continuing with efforts to further extend the pause in fighting - to allow more hostages to leave Gaza and more aid to enter. Speaking on his third visit to the Middle East since the war broke out last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he wanted to see the truce extended. But, he warned, if Israel was to restart its military campaign, it had to take effective steps to ensure the protection of civilians in Gaza. The images of Schem published on Thursday represented the first glimpse of her since the emergence of the Hamas footage last month - which showed her with an injured arm being treated while she was in captivity. That video was condemned by the French government, and prompted Schem's mother Keren to hold a news conference in Tel Aviv calling for her daughter's immediate release. Family video - published in Israeli media on Thursday - showed Keren weeping with joy at the news of her daughter's release, exclaiming: ""Mia's coming back!"" Schem's father David gave his own reaction to Israel's Channel 12 TV: ""It's the happiest day in the world; she's an amazing girl. I'm not going to leave her for a long period."" French President Emmanuel Macron described Schem's release as a source of ""great joy"". The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Schem's friend Elia Toledano remained in captivity, having also been abducted fromthe Supernova musical festivalon 7 October. The organisation described Schem as being ""full of joy for life, and with a huge heart"". It also saluted her ""fighting spirit"". It also gave details about the other woman released on Thursday, lawyer Amit Soussana. Ms Soussana lives by herself in Kfar Aza kibbutz, and was kidnapped while hiding in her shelter. She is said to be a fan of rock music and tennis, and has three cats. The six others later released from Gaza included siblings Bilal, 18, and Aisha Alziadana, 17. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said their father and brother were also take hostage, and remain captives of Hamas. It also said Mexican-born Ilana Gritzewsky, 30, had also been freed, as had Saphir Cohen, 29 - but the two women's partners were also still being held as hostages in Gaza. Twenty-nine-year old Shani Goren - said to have been kidnapped with her dog - was also returned to Israel, along with Nili Margalit, 41, who works as a paediatric nurse. Before Thursday's expected release, a total of 210 Palestinian prisoners had been released from Israeli jails. Among the latest wereprominent activist Ahed Tamimi, 22, who became a symbol of resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank while she was a teenager. She was arrested earlier this month over an Instagram post, which her family say she did not write. Those freed from Israeli prisons have been chosen from an original list of 300 Palestinians compiled by Israel. They had been accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to incitement to attempted murder. Fewer than a quarter of those on the list had been convicted; the vast majority were being held on remand while awaiting trial.",2023-11-30T22:14:30.000Z

Israel recalls ambassador in war spat with Spain PM Pedro SánchezPublished30 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has deepened a diplomatic row with Israel after he said he had ""serious doubts that Israel is complying with international humanitarian law"". His comments came days after he accused Israel of ""indiscriminate killing of Palestinians"" during its military operation in the Gaza Strip. Israel has condemned his latest remarks as outrageous. Israel says it aims to eliminate Hamas following its deadly attack on Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage as militants broke through the border fence between Israel and Gaza on 7 October. Since then, more than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's retaliation, the Hamas-run health ministry says. For the second time in a week, Spain's ambassador to Israel was summoned for a rebuke. ""Israel is acting, and will continue to act, according to international law, and will continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is eliminated from Gaza,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen posted on X. In response to what he called the latest ""baseless accusations"" by the Spanish leader, Mr Cohen said he had decided to recall Israel's ambassador to Madrid, Rodica Radian-Gordon, for consultations. Mr Sánchez won a new term as prime minister only two weeks ago but he has become one of the most outspoken critics among EU leaders of Israel's response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October. His left-wing government is made up of his Socialist party, the left-wing Sumar alliance and pro-independence Catalans. Ahead of last week's visit to Israel and the West Bank, he told parliament that his new government would work both in Europe and Spain to recognise a Palestinian state. Spain currently holds the EU presidency. He then travelled to Israel with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, telling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that while he defended Israel's right to defend itself, the number of Palestinian casualties was ""truly unbearable"". Israel accused the two prime ministers of failing to place ""full responsibility for the crimes against humanity committed by Hamas"", adding that their ""false claims... give support to terrorism"". Both countries' ambassadors were summoned for a reprimand. Spain's foreign minister rejected the Israeli accusations and in turn summoned Israel's ambassador. On his return to Spain, Mr Sánchez was criticised by domestic political opponents for giving ""classes in morality"". Madrid's centre-right regional leader Isabel Díaz Ayuso said that his ""embarrassing"" position was creating a wall separating Spain from Israel, US and the West. His latest intervention, during an interview with Spanish public broadcaster TVE, was derided by the Israeli prime minister's office for coming hours after Hamas gunmen shot dead three Israelis at a crowded bus stop on the outskirts of Jerusalem. The attackers got out of a car on a highway and opened fire with a rifle and a pistol. The Spanish prime minister said the footage from Gaza of people dying, especially boys and girls, was ""not acceptable"" and he repeated his belief that a solution to the crisis required ""recognition of the Palestinian state"". He said it was in Europe's interest to address ""out of moral conviction"". ""Friendly countries also have to tell each other the truth,"" he insisted.",2023-11-30T20:21:14.000Z

Liat Beinin Atzili: US citizen among 16 Hamas hostages releasedPublished30 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A dual US-Israeli citizen held hostage in Gaza has been released as part of a temporary ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. The hostage, Liat Beinin Atzili, was taken from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel on 7 October. She was among 12 Israeli and four Thai hostages released by Hamas on Wednesday. Eight other US citizens are believed still to be in captivity. Ms Atzili's release was confirmed by the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum and US President Joe Biden. ""I talked with her mother and father. They're very appreciative, and things are moving well,"" Mr Biden said. ""She'll soon be home with her three children."" It was believed Ms Atzili's husband Aviv was being held hostage as well after her release, Kibbutz Nir Oz announced on Friday that he had been killed on 7 October. His death has yet to be confirmed by US or Israeli officials. ""May his soul rest in peace,"" Kibbutz Nir Oz said in aFacebook postannouncing Aviv's death. They said he was the ""backbone of the Nir Oz community"", a ""painter, cyclist, lover of people and land"". Thirty Palestinians held by Israel were also released on Wednesday as part of the Qatari-mediated ceasefire deal. About 1,200 people were killed and some 240 hostages taken when Hamas raided Israel on 7 October. Mrs Atzili, 49, is a teacher at a school near Gaza and youth guide at Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to victims of the Holocaust. Dani Dayan, chairman of Yad Vashem, called for the release of more than 100 hostages still in captivity as well as Mrs Atzili's Yad Vashem colleague Alex Dancyg, a historian and Holocaust educator. In a Novemberinterview with Politico, Ms Atzili's father, Yehuda Beinin, said she reported that the situation on 7 October was ""crazy"" and that one of her friends recorded a conversation with her shortly before she was abducted. ""You can hear the desperation in her voice as to the situation around her house,"" he said. ""I've never heard her speak like this. It was very, very desperate, very low tone of voice. She may very well have been trying to be quiet, not to make noise."" ""That was basically the last anybody heard from her,"" Mr Beinin added. A statement from the Israeli security forces says the released hostages arrived back in Israeli territory via Egypt - accompanied by special forces troops. The statement says the group will undergo medical tests, before being taken to hospitals - where they will be reunited with their families. The group included three women with German-Israeli nationality and a minor with Dutch-Israeli nationality. Earlier, two Russian-Israeli citizens were released. Another US hostage, four-year-old Abigail Edan, was released earlier this week. Two other US hostages, Judith and Natalie Raanan, were released by Hamas ""for humanitarian reasons"" in late October. Eight other Americans are believed to be in captivity, the White House said earlier this week. In a statement on Wednesday, President Biden said the US is ""determined to secure the release of every person taken hostage by Hamas during its brutal terrorist assault on Israel on October 7"". Wednesday marked the sixth day of a truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Talks are ongoing in an effort to extend the ceasefire before it expires. ""The deal has delivered meaningful results,"" Mr Biden said. ""Nearly 100 hostages have been returned to their loved ones. And the United States has led the international community to use this pause to accelerate the delivery of additional humanitarian assistance into Gaza.""",2023-11-30T18:20:01.000Z

Bedouin family desperate for news on teenagers held hostage in GazaPublished30 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Each evening, Naeema Zyadna waits for the phone to ring. Since the Israel-Hamas temporary truce deal began last week, she's been expecting word that her children who were taken hostage by Hamas - 16-year-old Aisha and 18-year-old Bilal - are coming home. But they haven't yet. There are only a handful of child hostages left inside Gaza. Under the agreement struck between Israel and Hamas, under-19s were supposed to be released from captivity. On the sixth day, five more were freed, and almost 40 have now been returned home in total. But so far, Aisha and Bilal haven't been among them. Naeema told me she desperately hopes to feel that happiness herself, and can't understand why it hasn't happened yet. With just minutes until the ceasefire was due to end on Thursday morning the deal was extended again, for a seventh day. The publication of each additional hostage list brings fresh hope that her children's names will be on it. On the morning of 7 October, Aisha and Bilal had gone with their father - Naeema's husband, Yousef  - to work in a cowshed near the Israel-Gaza perimeter. Another son joined them, 22-year-old Hamza. Aisha was only there to have a picnic with her father. All four were kidnapped. The Zyadna family live in a modest Bedouin village in the southern Negev desert, near the city of Rahat. Arabs make up around a fifth of Israel's population, with many of them preferring to be called Palestinian citizens of Israel. Fewer than 10 of the hostages taken by Hamas and other factions in Gaza during the brutal attacks were from the Bedouin community, and double that number are believed to have been killed. A private, nomadic community, their stories of that day have been heard far less than others. Arabic-speaking and Muslim, the Bedouin are fiercely proud of their heritage, and the Zyadnas talk of the difficulties they've faced in trying to protect their culture and their land. Naeema says her faith gives her strength, and describes her belief that the fate of her husband and children is in the hands of Allah. Naeema's eyes fill with tears as we sit and talk outside her home, with the sound of her grandchildren playing nearby. ""Why during these 54 days has neither my daughter nor my son been released? Their father wasn't either. Why does Hamas not set them free? Why does Israel not call for their release like it did with others?"" she asks. ""They are young, in their teens and early 20s. Their father is diabetic and suffers from hypertension. He takes injections. Why were they not released?"" Bilal's car sits close to his mother's house. Locked and empty, the family have left it in exactly the same place as he last parked it. They don't want to move it - they're waiting for him to be freed to come back and drive it again himself. Above the small village is a piece of flat land, where a few coloured flags flutter in the wind. It's where marriage ceremonies are normally held, and where the community are hoping to hold a huge party to celebrate the return of their loved ones when they come back home. A short walk away, past a pen filled with curious, chattering white geese, Ali Zyadna sits drinking tiny cups of dark coffee. He is Yousef's brother, and holds up a poster covered with photos of his relatives' faces. The family shared a photo with us - a dark and distressing contrast to the smiling images from the placard. Taken from Hamas media channels and widely circulated, it shows Bilal and Hamza lying on their stomachs on the ground, the clothing removed from their upper bodies. Two Thai hostages lie close by, and two armed men loom over the group. One points his rifle at the ground with his finger close to the trigger. Extra ammunition is tucked into the green body armour he's wearing, and a Palestinian flag is visible on the front. The other man trains his weapons directly on the captives. Ali's message is clear: ""I'm speaking these words so Hamas will hear. I want to ask them to regard this as humanitarian and bring back our kids. They have returned two more Russians without any connection to the agreement. They brought back the Thais without anything in return. What's the problem for them to return the Muslims? We're asking, we're begging, give us back our kids safe and well."" Naeema too wants the world to focus on her family, and her Bedouin community, during their ordeal. She knows that telling people stories about her children, of Aisha's love of tea and cake, and Bilal's devotion to his pet horse and dog, is necessary to bring attention to their plight. ""I'm asking Hamas to bring back my children, enough is enough,"" she cries, her voice loud and loaded with emotion. ""Every night I feel bad, I can't take this any more, I'm losing my mind."" Ali wants Israel's leaders to increase their efforts too. ""The government always give us the answer that it's all in the hands of Hamas. But no, you are the state. Insist. You should insist. We're not jealous of anyone, we're happy that they've been returned, may they all come back. But it can't be right that there are adults in the groups who are being returned while a girl is left behind in captivity."" ""It's very hard for us. It's two months already. We thought they would have come back already. But everyone returned and they didn't. The wives, the women of the family, are crying, they want them home with us.""",2023-11-30T14:22:18.000Z

Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi freed by IsraelPublished30 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Activist Ahed Tamimi was one of 30 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel on Wednesday, as part of the truce deal with Hamas. Israel's prison service said a mixture of men and women had been freed ""from a number of [its] facilities"". Ms Tamimi, 22, was arrested earlier this month over an Instagram post, which her family say she did not write. As of Wednesday night, 102 hostages have been freed, while 210 Palestinian prisoners have been released. Images showed Ms Tamimi, who had been held in Damon Prison, near the Israeli city of Haifa, returned to the West Bank late on Wednesday. The prominent activist was pictured having an emotional reunion with her mother. Other prisoners, whose names have not yet been shared, were also seen reuniting with family members. The social media post Ms Tamimi was detained over is no longer visible online, nor is the account it came from, which carried her name and photo. Israeli media reported that she had threatened to ""slaughter"" Jewish settlers, but her mother said the account did not belong to her daughter. ""There are dozens of [online] pages in Ahed's name with her photo, with which she has no connection,"" she told AFP news agency at the time of her arrest. Israel's military told AFP she was arrested on suspicion of ""inciting violence and terrorist activities"". As a teenager, Ms Tamimi became a symbol of resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank. When she was 14 years old she was photographed biting an Israeli soldier who was trying to detain her younger brother. Two years later, she wasfilmed slapping and kicking an Israeli soldierin an altercation outside her home and was subsequently arrested and sentenced to eight months in prison. Her father, Bassem Tamimi, is an activist who used to regularly organise protests against the Israeli occupation and has been repeatedly jailed. Ms Tamimi is one of hundreds of Palestinians who have been arrested in the West Bank since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen from Gaza attacked southern Israel. Israel says the arrests have been made to limit violence during a time when unrest has surged in the West Bank. On Thursday,three Israelis were killedwhen two Hamas gunmen opened fire at a crowded bus stop in West Jerusalem during morning rush hour. The two attackers had come from occupied East Jerusalem. Sixteen Israelis were injured and the attackers were killed by police and an armed civilian. Earlier on Wednesday,two Palestinian boys, aged eight and 14,were shot and killed during a raid by the Israeli army in the West Bank city of Jenin. The Israeli military said explosive devices were thrown at its soldiers and that they responded with live fire.",2023-11-30T13:50:56.000Z

Hamas hostages: Joy and relief as 17 Thai workers return homePublished30 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Joyous scenes unfolded outside Bangkok international airport as 17 Thai hostages freed by Hamas returned home. Thirty-year-old Pornsawan Pinakalo, who was held in captivity for nearly 50 days, fell to his knees and cried when he saw his father. A beaming Khongpana Sudlamai rushed to his son and hugged him, before his smile turned into tears of relief. ""I am still having goosebumps,"" Mr Khongpana said. ""It felt like he had left us. But he has returned to us."" The release of the Thais is separate to an agreement that has so far seen Hamas free 70 Israeli women and children. Six Thai nationals who Hamas released in the last two days are still in Israel undergoing medical examinations. Nine remain in Hamas' custody. Nearly all of the abducted foreign workers were Thais. Israel employs some 30,000 of them as farm labour, making them one of the largest migrant groups in the country. A negotiated pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel, which has now lasted six days, has seen Hamas release 102 of the 240 hostages it seized last month in exchange for 210 Palestinian prisoners, many of them woman and teenagers, held in Israeli jails. Thirty-nine Thai nationals were among the 1,200 people Hamas killed in its attack on Israel on 7 October. More than 14,500 people have been killed in Gaza in Israel's retaliatory bombing since 7 October, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The last message Mr Khongpana received from his son was on that day soon after the attack began: ""I love you very much, dad and mom."" Mr Khongpana said he had begun to lose hope because Mr Pornsawan was not listed as a hostage initially. Then on the fifth day after the attack, authorities sent him photos of three workers who were killed in the kibbutz where Mr Pornsawan had been working. ""When the DNA I sent didn't match, then I had hope,"" says Mr Khongpana, who had been waiting for hours for the flight carrying his son home from Israel to arrive. He was not the only one. Chanapa and Sirirat Bupasiri left their village in the middle of the night so they could reach Bangkok in time for their brother Buddee Saengbun's arrival. ""We haven't had any sleep,"" Chanapa told the BBC. She smiled tearfully when asked what she would do when she finally met her brother again. ""Hugs. Hugs and tears,"" she said. ""One month and 18 days. We've been counting each day."" Most of the workers are from north-east Thailand, a poor, rice-growing region which sees much of its working-age population leave in search of better opportunities. Elderly parents who can't make the journey to Bangkok, or families that cannot afford the long trip, are waiting back home. ""I'm overjoyed. I can't wait for her to come home,"" says Bunyarin Srichan, whose daughter Nattawaree ""Yo"" Mulkan was the only Thai woman taken hostage by Hamas. She says they will celebrate with an indulgent meal - fried pork with garlic and ""the best sticky rice we've got"". She also plans to hold a small homecoming ceremony, widely believed by Thais to be a way to bring back a soul that has been spooked during a traumatic experience. Bunyarin, who has been caring for Yo's two children, said her daughter sent home half her salary every month - 25,000 Thai baht ($715; £560). Many of the workers borrow money to go to Israel and send home savings to support their families and pay off debt. Around 8,500 Thai nationals have been repatriated from Israel since the 7 October attack. But the BBC understands that some have since returned, likely driven by debt and joblessness back home. Many have previously told BBC Thai about their harrowing work conditions in Israel, such as unsanitary living quarters, as well as being overworked and underpaid. The temporary truce was scheduled to end on Thursday, but has now been extended by at least one day. That has given Narissara Chanthasang fresh hope - her husband, Nattapong Pinta, is still a Hamas hostage. ""I felt like my heart was being squeezed when I learned that he hadn't been freed yet,"" she said. ""I will definitely go to the airport [when he returns]. Nothing will stop me."" Mr Pornsawan says he ""would have been happier if all of our friends could return"". He says he had lived ""day by day"" in captivity, and tried not to think of the possibility that he might never go home. How does he feel now he's back? ""I can't put it into words. This is the happiest day of my life."" Mr Khongpana was eager to take him home. His son loves cooking, but this time, his father said, they had cooked something ""I know he will love"".",2023-11-30T12:28:21.000Z

Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza extended as more hostages freedPublished30 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend their truce for another day, minutes before it was due to expire. The temporary ceasefire was extended for a seventh day, shortly before 05:00 GMT, following mediation with Qatar. The deal has led to the release of dozens of hostages kidnapped by Hamas in exchange for Palestinians held in prisons and aid deliveries into Gaza. On Wednesday night, 16 more hostages taken captive by Hamas were released, as were 30 Palestinians. So far, some 102 Israeli hostages have been freed, while 210 Palestinians prisoners have been released. About 140 Israelis remain in captivity. Israel's military said the temporary ceasefire was being extended ""in light of the mediators' efforts to continue the process of releasing the hostages and subject to the terms of the framework"". The prime minister's office subsequently confirmed the extension, saying it had received a new list of women and children hostages, though it did not specify how many names were on the list.Hamas said there was an agreement to ""extend the truce for a seventh day,"" without giving further details. The initial truce was due to last four days but has been extended twice. When the agreement was negotiated, Israel said the pause in fighting would be extended by one day for every 10 further hostages released. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the truce was ""producing results"" and should continue. ""We have seen over the last week the very positive development of hostages coming home, being reunited with their families,"" he said at a meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv on Thursday. ""It's also enabled an increase in humanitarian assistance to go to innocent civilians in Gaza who need it desperately."" But on Wednesday Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, repeated earlier pledges to resume the war once the truce ends. ""There is no way we are not going back to fighting until the end. This is my policy, the entire cabinet stands behind it, the entire government stands behind it, the soldiers stand behind it, the people stand behind it - this is exactly what we will do,"" he said in a statement on Wednesday. Before the extension was agreed, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the Gaza Strip was in the midst of an ""epic humanitarian catastrophe"". He welcomed the negotiations to prolong the truce but added that a ""true humanitarian ceasefire"" was needed. The UN estimates that more than 1.8 million people in Gaza have fled their homes over the past seven weeks. About 60% of them are sheltering in 156 facilities belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa. Earlier this week, World Health Organization spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris said an assessment of those shelters had found outbreaks of infectious diseases, with cases of diarrhoea among children aged five and older more than 100 times normal levels. The truce has allowed a temporary halt to Israeli air strikes that began after 7 October when Hamas launched a major cross-border attack in southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage. Since then, Israel's air and ground operation into Gaza has killed about 15,000 people, 40% of which are children, according to health ministry officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Large parts in the north of the Strip have been demolished or seriously damaged.",2023-11-30T10:37:21.000Z

Royal Navy sends second warship to GulfPublished30 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The UK is to send a second warship to the Gulf, in response to rising tensions in the Middle East. HMS Diamond - a Type 45 destroyer - is en route to join the frigate HMS Lancaster. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said it was ""critical that the UK bolsters our presence in the region"". In addition, a UK-led task force is to soon begin patrols from the English Channel to the Baltic Sea, to protect Europe's critical undersea cables. HMS Lancaster has been stationed in the Gulf since last year. It is there alongside three Royal Navy minehunters. Mr Shapps said the addition of a destroyer would bolster deterrence in the region at a dangerous time. ""It is critical that the UK bolsters our presence in the region to keep Britain and our interests safe from a more volatile and contested world."" Specifically, he said, it would send a clear message to Iran and its proxies. Israel's war in Gaza has already prompted a response from Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as Houthi rebels in Yemen - although not yet on the scale first feared. The US boosted its naval footprint in the region soon after the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October. It has sent a US carrier strike group east of Suez, as well as placing a second aircraft carrier in the eastern Mediterranean. A US destroyer in the Red Sea has already intercepted missiles and drones - reported to have been launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen. Houthis have also been harassing commercial shipping in the region - seizing the cargo vessel MV Galaxy Leader and attempting to hijack a second. The Ministry of Defence says the addition of HMS Diamond will ensure the freedom of navigation, reassure merchant vessels and allow the safe flow of trade. Around 50 large merchant ships pass through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait daily while double that number pass through the Strait of Hormuz. The defence secretary also announced a second major naval deployment, closer to home, to protect undersea cables and critical national infrastructure. The task force of seven ships will set sail early next month, alongside allies, and will mount patrols from the English Channel all the way to the Baltic Sea. Royal Navy vessels will work alongside members of the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), which includes Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Though they've conducted exercises together in the past this will be the first time the JEF has conducted a joint operation. Mr Shapps described the deployment as historic - with allies from across northern Europe working together ""to defend our shared critical infrastructure against potential threats"". He did not mention a specific threat. But the UK and other nations involved in the JEF have highlighted concerns about the activities of Russian surveillance ships nearcritical national infrastructure, including wind farms and undersea cables,in recent years.

Two Palestinian boys killed during Israeli raid in West BankPublished29 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Four Palestinians, including two children, have been killed by Israeli forces during a raid in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials say. CCTV videos appeared to show eight-year-old Adam al-Ghoul and Basel Abu al-Wafa, 14, being shot during the same incident in the city of Jenin. The Israeli military said suspects threw explosive devices at its soldiers and that they responded with live fire. It also said troops killed ""two high-ranking terrorists"" during the raid. There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's attack on southern Israel on 7 October. Footage shows a small figure on a security camera video turning and starting to run, before falling sharply to the ground. His eight-year-old body is easily dragged from the road by a friend. The life of Adam al-Ghoul ended in Jenin on Wednesday with a shot to the head, as Israeli forces withdrew from a military operation in the refugee camp there. Nearby, his 14-year-old friend, Basel Abu al-Wafa was fighting for his life after being shot in the chest, with gunfire hitting the ground around him. At Jenin Hospital, both boys were declared dead. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that during ""activity in the Jenin camp, a number of suspects hurled explosive devices toward IDF soldiers"". ""The soldiers responded with live fire toward the suspects and hits were identified."" As Basel's body was prepared for burial in the crowded hospital morgue, a relative watched as the teenager was wrapped in the green flag of Hamas. It wasn't what Basel would have wanted, he told the BBC. ""He's innocent, not from the militias,"" he said, teetering between anger and grief. ""He's perfect in school, a good boy, kind."" The hospital director, Dr Wissam Bakr, said the boys' wounds - from shots to the head and chest - showed that they were intentionally killed. ""There's no safe place in Jenin now,"" he said. The war in Gaza has increased tensions here in the West Bank, where there are near-nightly raids by Israel's forces. In its operations in Jenin overnight, the IDF said it had killed a senior commander for Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Mohammed Zubeidi, and another called Wissam Hanoun who had been inside a building with him. It accused Zubeidi of involvement in two shootings in May in which an Israeli civilian was killed and several soldiers were wounded. Palestinian Islamic Jihad - which like Hamas is classed as a terrorist group by Israel, the UK and other Western powers - confirmed that two of its local commanders were killed. The IDF also said it had arrested 17 wanted individuals during the raid. Israeli missiles, grenades and explosives have left a broad scar of destruction in Jenin's camp - several houses gutted or collapsed, and large chunks of masonry hanging over mounds of rubble. Diggers were helping search for a body still believed to be buried there. Militant leaders were the target here, killed along with boys of eight and 14. Before the Jenin raid, the UN said that at least 225 Palestinians, including more than 50 children, had been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since 7 October. Adam and Basel are the latest casualties of a conflict that keeps getting older, even as children die.",2023-11-29T21:54:14.000Z

Fears for displaced Gazans as winter approaches and diseases spreadPublished29 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"In the cramped conditions of a makeshift tent near the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, Nariman cradles her baby daughter. The 23-day-old girl is younger than the war itself and Nariman's whole family is sick. ""I don't have enough money to buy my daughter medicine even though she needs medical support to help her breathe"", says the young mother, wrapped up against the cold of the encroaching winter. ""My husband is seriously ill and my young son also needed hospital treatment yesterday."" The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, has said that Gaza is in the midst of an ""epic humanitarian catastrophe"", and that ""the world must not look away"". Even if the current pause in hostilities is extended by a few days, Israel has made it clear the military offensive will soon resume, targeting what remains of Hamas' capabilities across Gaza. That, say aid agencies, will exacerbate what is already a dire humanitarian situation, particularly around Khan Younis where thousands of people have sought refuge from the fighting in the north. The fragile truce of the past six days has allowed the UN and others to assess what damage seven weeks of bombing has done and what pressing needs the population now has. ""We cannot get enough aid in through the Rafah crossing right now as winter approaches,"" says Thomas White, the director of affairs in Gaza for the United Nations Palestinian Refugee Agency. White, who toured parts of the heavily-bombed Gaza City and the destroyed infrastructure, added: ""There's poor sanitation and we're very concerned about an outbreak of infectious diseases such as watery diarrhoea as people are forced to live in very cramped conditions with poor sanitation."" The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that, given living conditions and the lack of health care, ""more people in Gaza could die from disease than bombings"". Over 100,000 people have acute respiratory infections and 80,000 are suffering with diarrhoea, the WHO says. Half of those are said to be under the age of five. Israel has often denied there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza and points to the 200 or so trucks currently being allowed into the territory each day during this truce, bringing in much-need food, medicines and limited fuel supplies. Distributed throughout Gaza, via UN warehouses and collection points, the badly-needed food, medicines and limited fuel is quickly snapped up. It is thought that more than one million Gazans are now living in temporary shelters, having been forced from their homes elsewhere in the besieged Palestinian territory. If and when the bombing resumes, the aid will again be reduced to a trickle and thousands of internally displaced people will face the prospect of having to move on again, to areas with much less aid and even fewer resources.",2023-11-29T21:11:14.000Z

A middle-aged woman rails at the world in a queue for cooking gas in Deir al-Balah, a town in the centre of the Gaza Strip. She shouts angrily in the air, desperation and frustration visible in her face, despair lurking in the background. ""We've been waiting in line to fill one gas cylinder since early morning. I performed my morning prayers while standing."" She tells me that she had to flee her home in Beit Hanoun in the north, just 2km (1.2 miles) from the border with Israel. ""I can't describe the destruction. Entire families have been erased from civil records. They were killed under their houses. ""Gaza has been completely destroyed. Have mercy on us."" She is now living with her family at a UN-run school in Deir al-Balah. After Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostage, Israel started air strikes and then launched a ground invasion. At least 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Gaza Strip is home to 2.3 million people and the UN says 80% have been displaced by the conflict, with Israel ordering everyone living in the north to evacuate south of the Wadi Gaza river. On Friday, a four-day pause in the fighting began under a deal between Israel and Hamas, which saw 50 of the hostages held in Gaza freed in return for the release of 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The two sides later extended the truce for two days from Tuesday to allow an additional 20 hostages and 60 prisoners to be released. The agreement also allowed more aid to be sent to Gaza. Up to 200 aid lorries have been crossing from Egypt each day. But that is still less than half of the number of lorries that entered daily before the war. UN agencies have said they have been able to deliver some of that aid to the north, which has been the focus of the Israeli ground offensive, but there are huge shortages everywhere. There are hundreds in the queue for cooking gas in Deir al-Balah, about 6km south of Wadi Gaza. Young men sit on gas cylinders as they wait. The air is tense. People are exhausted. ""You can't find a cup of tea or one pack of biscuits. Yesterday, people were sharing bread while sleeping on the street,"" says another man in the queue. ""The rain that we witnessed yesterday and the cold we went through. People spent the night here. May God help us."" Israel cut off electricity and most water, and stopped deliveries of food, fuel and other goods to Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's attack. Limited aid deliveries resumed on 21 October, but Israel halted all fuel shipments until 15 November and then allowed in only a limited amount. A US official says 140,000 litres of fuel is currently being delivered every two days. The Israeli government says the fuel could be used by Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in Israel, the EU, UK and US. Mohammed al-Qidrah is waiting patiently in the cooking gas queue. ""We've been here for three days. We came here two nights ago and from 03:00 until now, we haven't been able to fill up,"" he says. ""We can't find fuel, flour or anything. You need to stand in line for everything and you struggle to find it."" The World Health Organization is warning that more people will die from disease than in bombings in Gaza if the health infrastructure is not restored. Meanwhile, a UN-led aid consortium says 60% of the buildings in the territory are damaged or destroyed. As the truce holds, there are signs some life is returning to Gaza, with people trying to harvest the remainder of this year's olive crop. ""We have to take advantage of this opportunity, there's no time,"" farmer Fathy Abu Salah told the Reuters news agency at his olive grove near the southern city of Khan Younis. ""This war destroyed us, there's hardly any production. The majority of the harvest was wasted."" A lack of electricity has also left the local olive press reliant on fuel to power its machinery. ""Finding fuel is a crisis that everyone is facing,"" says olive farmer and press worker Mohamed Wafy. ""As soon as we secured access to fuel, we were able to open the olive press, even if it's working at minimum capacity.""",2023-11-29T12:59:42.000Z

Gaza hospital doctor speaks of moment missile hitPublished29 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A British-Palestinian surgeon who has been working to save lives in Gaza has returned to the UK after 43 days. BBC London previously interviewed Prof Ghassan Abu-Sittah, from Médecins Sans Frontières, who has been helping to treat people wounded in the war, at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital. As the interview concluded, on 17 October, the hospital was hit by a missile. Now back in London, he has spoken of the moment the hospital was struck. Pictures that emerged of the hospital show scenes of chaos, with bloodied and maimed casualties being rushed out on stretchers in the darkness. Bodies and wrecked vehicles can be seen in the rubble-strewn street outside. Another doctor told the BBC that 80% of the hospital was taken out of service and estimated that as many as 1,000 people had been injured and many killed in the blast. Hamas said the blast was caused by an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military, however, said it was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad - an accusation the militant group rejected. On 23 October, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the Commons that the UK had judged that the blast at the hospitalwas likely to have been caused by ""a missile, or part of one"" fired from ""within Gaza"". Prof Abu-Sittah described how parts of the hospital were on fire and the roof of an operating theatre fell in. He told BBC London: ""There was lots of dust, people were screaming and rushing past me. That's when I called your colleague back, not just to tell him - but I needed to my family to know - I was alive. ""It was just carnage in the emergency department; there was a man that had shrapnel in his neck. There were bodies and parts of bodies everywhere including that of the forearm of a young child on the floor."" Prof Abu-Sittah said across Gaza there were more than 7,000 wounded children who would need reconstructive surgery. He said that of the 36 hospitals in Gaza, only nine were currently functioning and that ""unless there is a real humanitarian corridor which allows lots of medical teams to increase the capacity, patients will die from wound infections"". ""My biggest worry is that those who were fortunate enough to survive the initial attack will die from untreated wounds,"" he added. Asked about leaving Gaza, he said: ""It's taken its toll on me physically and emotionally. I am also filled with this overwhelming sense of guilt towards the patients that still need my help and the kind of surgeries that I'm able to provide and that they might not otherwise get as there are not any other resources. ""I feel guilt for leaving my colleagues who I have left behind who are working in these extremely difficult circumstances."" The Al Ahli Arab Hospital is funded by the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, which says the facility is independent of any political factions in Gaza. Israeli warplanes and artillery have been bombarding Gaza in response to the 7 October Hamas attack in which 1,400 people were killed and more than 200 others were kidnapped.

"Freed Hamas captives tell of fear, squalor and hungerPublished28 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Bare benches for beds in ""suffocating"", airless rooms. Little to no food. A child captive forced by Hamas to watch the carnage of 7 October on video. Stories emerging from those freed from Gaza - mostly through their relatives - paint a picture of weeks spent in squalor, uncertainty and fear. One hostage, Ruti Munder, 78, said she learned her son had been killed in Israel by listening to a radio used by guards. Deborah Cohen claimed her 12-year-old nephew was made to watch videos of the Hamas rampage through southern Israel. More than 60 of the estimated 240 people taken hostage by Hamas have now been freed under the Israel-Hamas truce deal. Few have spoken directly about their experiences, but those who have - either themselves or through their families - relay a captivity that has left a host of emotional and physical scars. In an interview with French television channel BFM, Ms Cohen described the conditions that her nephew Eitan Yahalomi, 12, endured throughout his 52 days as a hostage. ""When he arrived in Gaza, all of the residents, all of them, beat him up. He's a 12-year-old child,"" she said, adding that any child who cried was ""threatened with rifles"". Ms Cohen said that Eitan had told her that ""Hamas forced him to watch horror videos"" of the 7 October attacks, when at least 1,200 people were killed. ""Yesterday (when Eitan was released) we were so happy,"" Deborah Cohen told BFMTV, ""but now that I know this I worry. It's unimaginable. I don't know who could do such a thing."" ""I wanted to believe that Eitan would be well treated. Apparently not. Those people are monsters."" The Times of Israel reported that Eitan's father, Ohad, was shot and wounded in a gun battle and remains in captivity in Gaza. Other hostages have told relatives of being kept in crowded underground hallways and rooms with little electricity. They were strictly controlled by their guards - denied pens in case they tried to communicate covertly among themselves. Ruti Munder, 78, was freed on Friday along with her daughter Keren, 54, and nine-year-old grandson Ohad Munder-Zichri. She said her captors had forced her group to sleep on benches without mattresses, in a ""suffocating"" room with little fresh air. She was fortunate to be given a sheet - many others including young girls and boys were not. ""We covered ourselves with a sheet. The boys slept under the benches, on the ground, because we wanted them next to us,"" she told Israel's Channel 13. It also appears that Hamas split families up - with many left in the dark about what had happened to their relatives on 7 October. In video footage released by Mrs Munder's family, a relative is heard saying that her husband Avraham, also aged 78, was still being held hostage. Keren Munder replies: ""So he wasn't murdered."" Mrs Munder then describes how she had learned from listening to the radio in captivity that her son, Roy, had been killed by Hamas in Nir Oz kibbutz. Food varied. The 78-year-old said she received chicken and rice at first, with tea twice a day. ""We were OK,"" she said, but added that what they were given soon changed when ""the economic situation was not good, and people were hungry"". Another relative, Merav Raviv, described how Mrs Munder and her daughter had each lost around 7kg (15lb). Others have spoken of a meagre, dwindling diet of canned hummus, pitta bread and salty cheese - towards the end some hostages said they received just two slices of bread a day. Those involved in looking after freed children say that many are suffering effects of psychological strain. A resident of Kibbutz Be'eri said two released girls were still speaking in whispers, after weeks of being told to keep their voices down by their captors. Thomas Hand, the father of nine-year-old Irish-Israeli Emily Hand, who was released on Sunday, said that his daughter now cries herself to sleep at night. ""She's coming out slowly, little by little,"" he told US media. ""The most shocking, disturbing part of meeting her was that she was just whispering, you couldn't hear her. I had to put my ear on her lips,"" he said. ""She'd been conditioned not to make any noise."" Elma Avraham, 84, was released on Sunday and transferred immediately by helicopter to a hospital in Beersheba in a ""serious and life-threatening"" condition. Her daughter Tali Amano said that Hamas had held her mother, who already suffered several serious medical conditions, in terrible conditions. Vital daily medications were denied for some 50 days, she said, adding: ""My mother arrived hours before we would have lost her."" Hagai Levine, the head of medical affairs from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, said that Mrs Avraham had been held ""for 52 days ... in conditions that no human being should be kept in... without human dignity"". Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old hostage who was released weeks ago on 23 October, said at the timeshe had been through hell. The grandmother and peace activist was kidnapped by Hamas on motorbikes, beaten with sticks and taken into a ""spider's web"" of tunnels under Gaza. But she also describes hostages as being ""treated well"", with clean conditions and mattresses on the floor for them to sleep on. ""They made sure we wouldn't get sick, and we had a doctor with us every two or three days,"" she said.",2023-11-28T22:44:29.000Z

"Boy, 14, and freelance reporter among Palestinians freedPublished28 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Thirty Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel on Tuesday night as part of the truce deal with Hamas. They include ""15 minors and 15 women"", a spokesman for Qatar's foreign ministry said. Among those released are Marwat al-Azza, a freelance journalist who had previously worked with US broadcaster NBC, and a 14-year-old boy. They were freed as 10 Israeli and two foreign hostages were released by Hamas in Gaza. The Israeli prison service said the prisoners had been released from Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank and the Jerusalem Detention Center. Tuesday was the fifth day of the truce between Israel and Hamas, after a 48-hour extension was agreed yesterday. Ms al-Azza, 45, was arrested earlier this month in East Jerusalem on suspicion of inciting terrorism and identifying with a terrorist organisation in relation to social media posts she made about Hamas's attack on 7 October, which killed about 1,200 Israelis. NBC cut ties with her following her arrest. Another prisoner released by Israel was named by Al Jazeera as Ahmed Salayme, 14. Last May, UK-based website Middle East Eye reported that the teenager was arrested on charges of throwing stones in East Jerusalem. In an interview upon his release, he told Al Jazeera that Israeli prison officers carried out ""a number of beatings"" including on female inmates, on the day the war started on 7 October. He added that he was told not to celebrate his release: ""I'm not allowed to leave my house, raise any signs or banners, use a megaphone. And if I break any of these rules I will be taken back,"" he said. His mother told Al Jazeera Israeli authorities had searched the family home several times ahead of her son's release and said she was afraid her son could be rearrested at any moment. Reuters news agency showed images of Palestinians cheering just outside Ofer prison at the Beitunia checkpoint as the new batch of prisoners were driven past on buses marked with the the International Red Cross sign. Israel's national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir has banned Palestinians from celebrating the prisoners' release, according to Israeli media. ""My instructions are clear: there are to be no expressions of joy. Expressions of joy are equivalent to backing terrorism,"" Mr Ben Gvir was quoted as saying. Since Friday, a total of 180 Palestinians - mostly women and teenage boys - have been released from Israeli jails as part of the truce. They were chosen from an original list of 300 Palestinians compiled by Israel and had been accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to incitement to attempted murder. Fewer than a quarter of those on the list had been convicted - the vast majority were being held on remand while awaiting trial. Under the terms of the truce, three Palestinians are being freed in exchange for each Israeli hostage returned from Gaza.",2023-11-28T22:36:04.000Z

"'We fought to get her back,' son says as more hostages releasedPublished28 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The son of 75-year-old hostage Ada Sagi has told BBC News he plans to give her the biggest hug and tell her ""how hard we fought"" for her release. Ada Sagi was among 10 Israelis - nine women and a girl - and two Thais released on the fifth day of the truce. We spoke to British-Israeli Noam Sagi just after his mother and the others were handed over to the Red Cross on Tuesday evening. ""It really is a beautiful, amazing moment,"" he said. Ada was released alongside: Tamar Metzger, 78; Ditza Hayman, 84; Norlin Babdila, 60; Ophelia Edith Roitman, 77; Rimon Kirsht, 36; and Merav Tal, 53. Three members of one family were also freed: Clara Marman, 63; Gabriela Leimberg, 59; and Mia Leimberg, 17. ""It's such a huge relief,"" said Noam Sagi. ""I've just finished a video call with her. She's sharp, she's funny, she's witty. She's her own self. I'm over the moon. ""I just want to feel her and hug her and I want her to know how hard we fought to get to this day and she will know forever how loved she is."" He said she ""looks good, she was very happy"" But he says there's a lot she doesn't know. ""She doesn't know she doesn't have a home to go back to, she doesn't know so many of her friends were murdered."" ""We will have to pick up the puzzle and put everything in place... but for now, today, it's really just about the joy,"" he added. I first met Noam at his home in north London two days after his mum was taken from her home in the kibbutz of Nir Oz, near Israel's border with Gaza. He played us a video filmed by Hamas that showed gunmen on the grass outside his mum's house and her car on fire. He has since met the UK prime minister, MPs, talked at rallies and spoken to diplomats and the Red Cross to try and get his mum released. Before she was kidnapped, Ada, an Arabic speaker, had taught others Arabic so they could communicate with their Palestinian neighbours. She was, her son said, a peace activist and part of a community who ""fought all their lives for good neighbouring relationships"". Ada had been due to visit London for her 75th birthday the week after she was kidnapped. Speaking earlier, he told the BBC that waiting to see if she would be among those released amounted to ""psychological terror"". ""Every night waiting like a leaf for a list.. Are we in? Are we out? It's been excruciatingly painful,"" he said, describing it as ""Russian roulette to the heart"". While some people tore down posters showing those kidnapped from walls in the UK, Noam was talking to the lampposts that had pictures of his mum on. The other hostages released on Tuesday included 84-year-old Ditza Heiman, one of the founders of kibbutz Nir Oz, which Hamas attacked on 7 October. Also kidnapped from Nir Oz was Ofelia Roitman, 77, who moved to Israel from Argentina in the 1980s. She sent a message pleading for help as Hamas attacked. Her daughter said in a video that a search of her house afterwards had found other bodies, but she was missing. Clara Merman, Gabriela Leimberg and her daughter Mia were among a group of five Argentinian-Israelis who had been hiding in their safe room, according to one of the group's daughter who was texting with her father. Noralin ""Nataly"" Babadilla, 60, was visiting Kibbutz Nirim, to celebrate the community's 70th anniversary. Her husband was murdered. Her younger brother, Exo, told the Bring Them Home website that her last words to him were: ""I'm shaking; maybe I won't come home."" Meanwhile Meirav Tal, 53, had been visiting her partner Yair in Nir Oz. The couple were kidnapped along with Yair's children Yagil and Or,who were released on Monday. Yair remains in Hamas captivity in Gaza.",2023-11-28T21:46:57.000Z

"Untreated diseases could kill more than bombings in Gaza, WHO warnsPublished28 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Untreated diseases could eventually kill more people in Gaza than bombings if the health system is not restored, the World Health Organization says. Diarrhoea and respiratory infections are widespread among children in overcrowded UN facilities where almost 1.1 million people are sheltering. Patients with chronic illnesses like cancer are also receiving no treatment. The warning comes as a truce between Israel and Hamas entered a fifth day, after a 48-hour extension was agreed. The deal mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States should see an additional 20 Israeli women and children held hostage in Gaza being released in exchange for 60 Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli prisons. On Monday, 11 hostages and 33 prisoners were freed on the fourth and final day of the initial agreement, bringing the totals to 50 hostages and 150 prisoners released. Nineteen foreign nationals, one of whom has Israeli citizenship, have also been handed over by Hamas under separate agreements. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza and imposed a siege in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since the war began. The UN estimates that more than 1.8 million people in Gaza have fled their homes over the past seven weeks. About 60% of them are sheltering in 156 facilities belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa. WHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told a news conference in Geneva that an assessment of those shelters had found outbreaks of infectious diseases, with cases of diarrhoea among children aged five and older more than 100 times normal levels by early November. No treatment is available for them, she said, without which infants in particular can deteriorate and die very quickly. According to the UN, only five hospitals are partially operational in the north of Gaza, the area that has been the focus of the Israeli ground offensive. Eight of the 11 hospitals are functional in the south, where the Israeli military has ordered civilians to flee. Only one of those hospitals has the capacity to treat critical trauma cases or perform complex surgery. ""Eventually, we will see more people dying from disease than we are even seeing from the bombardment if we are not able to put back [together] this health system,"" Dr Harris warned. Addressing journalists via video link from Gaza, Unicef spokesman James Elder reported seeing hospitals full of children with horrendous war wounds. He described seeing one child missing part of his leg lying untreated on a hospital floor for several hours because of a lack of medical staff. Other injured children were lying in car parks and gardens outside, he said. Displaced children and their families are also suffering because of a lack of proper shelter and clothing to protect them from the rainy and cold weather currently in Gaza. Over the first four days of the truce, 800 aid lorries entered Gaza, with some reaching the north, according to US officials. That is an increase in comparison to the preceding few days, but it is still just a fraction of the usual number. The UN agencies say that in such conditions, a resumption in fighting should be unthinkable, they are calling again for a permanent ceasefire. Israel's prime minister has promised that its military will ""go to realising our goals with full force"" when the pause ends. However, Qatar's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it would use the extension to seek a ""sustainable truce that would lead to further negotiations and eventually an end... to this war"". ""We are working with what we have. And what we have right now is the provision to the agreement that allows us to extend days as long as Hamas is able to guarantee the release of at least 10 hostages,"" spokesman Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha. He added that mediators hoped to receive information from Hamas about the more than 150 Israelis and foreign nationals still being held hostage, who include children as young as 10 months old as well as a number of soldiers. A senior Hamas source in Qatar told the BBC that not all of the civilian hostages were in its hands. Some were with smaller armed groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which like Hamas is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers. According to the source, Hamas needs more time to collect information and contact people. Communication is very difficult because of the damage to the telecoms network and the shortage of fuel to power it. Mr Ansari also said only ""minimal breaches"" of the truce had been reported. But two hours after he spoke the Israeli military said three explosive devices had been detonated near its troops in two different locations in northern Gaza in violation of the agreement. ""In one of the locations, terrorists also opened fire at the troops, who responded with fire. A number of soldiers were lightly injured during the incidents,"" it added. Hamas's military wing said there had been ""friction"" in the north and that its fighters had dealt with an ""clear breach"" of the truce deal by Israeli troops. Gunfire and explosions were earlier reported in north-western Gaza City. A local journalist told the BBC that dozens of displaced people were trying to return to their houses in the Sheikh Radwan area when they approached Israeli army positions, and that an Israeli tank and troops fired warning shots. One person was wounded and a building was hit by a shell, they said.",2023-11-28T16:07:37.000Z

"'Granny, I've been shot,' said Palestinian student targeted in VermontPublished28 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","After being ambushed and shot in the spine on a US street at the weekend, Hisham Awartani called police. Then the Palestinian-American student phoned his British-born grandmother. ""Granny, I've been shot,"" the 20-year-old said, his uncle told the BBC. Mr Awartani was targeted on Saturday in Burlington, Vermont, along with two fellow Palestinian-American students. He and the other victims - Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Aliahmad - are expected to survive. All three are recovering from their injuries in an intensive care unit at hospital. But for Mr Awartani, who was most critically injured, family members fear he may not walk again. His road to recovery will be long either way, his uncle said. ""The bullet is lodged in his T2 vertebra against his spine,"" Rich Price said. The uncle said the incident had left him and other relatives of the victims with a sense of shame, as family members had encouraged the young men to pursue university education in the US for stability and safety. ""Never could we have imagined that they would come here to study and something like this could happen to them,"" Mr Price said. Mr Awartani is in his third year of studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He and his friends were attacked after attending the birthday party of Mr Price's twin eight-year-old sons at a local bowling alley. The three 20-year-olds are childhood best friends who attended the Ramallah Friends School, a Quaker-run private non-profit in the West Bank. They were in Burlington visiting relatives for US Thanksgiving, and were staying with Mr Awartani's grandmother, Marian Price, who is originally from Surbiton, Surrey. They were gunned down round the corner from her home. ""Within five minutes of leaving the house, a man stepped out of the darkness, pulled a gun on them and shot four times,"" said Mr Price. Two of them were shot in the chest, he said, and a third was shot in the lower part of his body. Mr Awartani was also shot in the hand, his uncle said. Police have arrested a suspect, 48-year-old Jason Eaton, who lives near Mr Awartani's relatives, in a neighbourhood close to the University of Vermont. When he opened his front door to find federal agents who were searching for him, he told them he had been expecting them, officials said Mr Eaton appeared in court on Monday and pleaded not guilty to three counts of second-degree attempted murder. He is being held without bail. Police have not identified a possible motive, but are investigating whether a hate crime was committed. Relatives believe the young men were deliberately targeted because of their Palestinian background. They were speaking a mix of English and Arabic at the time they were shot, and two were wearing keffiyehs, traditional Palestinian scarves. The incident comes as the US deals with a surge in Islamophobia and antisemitism since the start of the Israel-Gaza war. Mr Price said the attack is especially heart-breaking given the sense of safety the family previously felt in Burlington, a city of around 45,000 people. ""To have something like this happen,"" Mr Price said, ""which in our view is most likely driven by hate, it is devastating for us."" The uncle said that despite his nephew's serious injury, he had shown strength and even a sense of humour while recovering in intensive care. ""I do know that he is incredibly grateful that so many people are thinking about him,"" he added. Mr Price said his family had been heartened by the support the three young men have received, not just from the US but across the globe. At a vigil held in his honour on Monday night at Brown University's campus, a professor read out a statement from Mr Awartani describing himself as ""one casualty in a much wider conflict"", NBC News reported. But the vigil was disrupted by hundreds of pro-Palestinian students who chanted ""shame on you"" at the university president and demanded the school divest its endowment from companies profiting from the war. US President Joe Biden has denounced the attack. ""While we are waiting for more facts, we know this: there is absolutely no place for violence or hate in America. Period,"" Mr Biden said in a statement.",2023-11-28T14:14:01.000Z

Israel Gaza: 33 Palestinians released on fourth day of trucePublished28 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"More Palestinians have been freed from Israeli prisons on the fourth day of a truce between Israel and Hamas. The release of 33 people means 150 Palestinians have been released since Friday - the day both sides began swapping hostages and prisoners. Fifty-one Israeli hostages, including three-year-old-twin sisters, have been freed by Hamas as part of the deal. Qatar has said the pause in fighting will be extended by two days, which Israel has not confirmed or denied. Little information has been released about the latest group of Palestinians to be freed. On Monday both Hamas and Qatar - which has played a major role in the talks between the warring sides - said 30 Palestinian children and three women were due to be freed. The Israel Prison Service later said 33 people had been freed from Ofer prison in the West Bank, and a detention centre in Jerusalem, but did not specify their genders or ages. By the evening, Reuters news agency reported that a bus carrying the newly released Palestinian prisoners had arrived in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank. Images showed people in the Palestinian city, waiting to greet them - some carrying green flags of Hamas, their faces covered with balaclavas. Separate images showed a Palestinian boy named Muhammad Abu Al-Humus reuniting with his mother, and other family members, at the family's home in East Jerusalem. Al-Humus called his release ""an indescribable joy"" and kissed his mother's hand, the AFP news agency reports. It was not immediately clear which facility he had been detained in, or for how long. Eitaf Jaradat, one of the three Palestinian women released in the latest exchange, said ""the price of our freedom is seemingly expensive"" as she was welcomed back by her family. ""We always hope that we are freed and that our people are in a good situation. But this is our destiny that we were freed while they are on a sea of blood,"" she told Reuters. Ms Jaradat was arrested in 2021, accused of involvement in a shooting that caused the death of an Israeli settler, according to Reuters. While fighting between Hamas and Israel is temporarily suspended, aid organisations have taken the opportunity to send lorries into Gaza filled with essentials such as food, water, fuel and medicines. Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children, should a two-day extension of the truce go ahead. Israel has not commented explicitly on the extension, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Monday evening that it had ""approved the inclusion of 50 female prisoners in the list of prisoners eligible to be released, in the event that a release of additional Israeli hostages is carried out"".",2023-11-28T09:34:32.000Z

Israel Gaza: Three-year-old-twins among hostages released by HamasPublished28 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A mother and her three-year-old twin daughters, who were kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October, are among 11 Israeli hostages released on Monday. Sharon Aloni Cunio, and her children Ema and Yuly, were taken from kibbutz Nir Oz with some other family members. Their release came on the fourth day of a truce between Israel and Hamas, with Israeli hostages being swapped for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Another mother and seven children make up the latest batch of freed hostages. Sharon Aloni Cunio's husband, David Cunio, was also taken hostage by Hamas last month. He and his brother Ariel are still believed to be in Gaza, held captive. Her sister Danielle Aloni and five-year-old niece, Emilia, were released by Hamas last week. They were all kidnapped from the same kibbutz - Nir Oz, in southern Israel - after taking shelter in a safe room. Hamas had then set fire to the house, and the family were captured as they tried to escape the flames. Also freed on Monday were teenage brothers Or Yaakov, 16, and Yagil who turned 13 while being held by Hamas. They were kidnapped on 7 October along with their father Yair Yaakov and his partner Meirav Tal, both of who are still thought to be in captivity. The children's mother, Ranana, was on the phone with them when Hamas arrived, and heard her youngest son cry: ""Don't take me, I'm too young!"" Siblings Sahar Kalderon, 16, and her 12-year-old brother Erez were freed by Hamas, too. Their father Ofer, 53, has not been released. Also released were Karina Engel-Bart, 52, and her daughters, Mika, 18 and Yuval, 11. Ms Engel-Bart's husband, 55-year-old Ronen Engel, remains in Gaza. Speaking to local media in Israel, her brother Diego Engel-Bert, said the family had been ""glued to the TV screen and full of happiness and longing"" after finding out their relatives were to be released. Eitan Yahalomi, 12, was the final Israeli hostage to be released on Monday. His mother, Batshema Yahalomi,told the BBCearlier this month that Eitan and her husband, Ohad, had been taken by Hamas fighters on the back of motorbikes. Qatar, a chief negotiator in the talks between Israel and Hamas, said on Monday that both sides had agreed to extend the temporary truce by two days. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied this. Under the extension, Hamas has committed to release another 20 women and children, according to US national security spokesman John Kirby. He estimated that up to nine of the remaining hostages were American, and said he hoped they would be among those released in the coming days.",2023-11-28T03:46:03.000Z

Elon Musk visits Israel after antisemitism rowPublished27 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel's president has told Elon Musk he has ""an important role"" in preventing antisemitism, which both he and his social media platform X have been accused of promoting. Addressing the entrepreneur, Isaac Herzog said social media ""including some you lead - harbor so much of the age-old disease of antisemitism"". On Monday Mr Musk visited a kibbutz Hamas targeted in its deadly attack. He toured the Kfar Aza with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr Musk was shown footage of the 7 October attacks on Israel by Hamas, in which 1,200 people died and 240 were taken hostage, including brutal footage from bodycams. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 14,500 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory campaign. The pair also held a brief live-streamed conversation on X, during which Mr Musk agreed with Mr Netanyahu that the only way to obtain peace and security was to destroy Hamas. ""You first have to get rid of the poisonous regime as you did in Germany, as you did in Japan. Yeah, in World War Two,"" Mr Netanyahu said. Mr Musk replied: ""There's no choice. There's no choice."" The trip also saw an agreement reached over Mr Musk's satellite internet service, Starlink. After Gaza experienced major internet disruption and outages as Israel intensified its military operations, Mr Musk had suggested giving Starlink to major aid organisations in the territory. But Israel argued the tech would be used by Hamas. Now an agreement has been reached that Starlink can only be used in Israel and Gaza with approval of the Israeli government. Israel's Communication Minister Shlomo Karhi said this understanding was ""vital"". Mr Musk's visit comes after Apple, Disney, IBM and Comcast paused adverts on X in the wake of an investigation by a US group, Media Matters for America, which flagged ads appearing next to pro-Nazi posts. Advertising is a critical source of income for X, which has fiercely challenged the report, questioning its research methods. It has launched what Elon Musk billed as a ""thermonuclear lawsuit"" against the organisation. In response, Media Matters called Mr Musk a bully. Mr Musk has also been criticised for promoting an antisemitic trope when he replied to a post on X that shared a conspiracy theory which falsely accused Jewish communities of pushing hatred against white people,calling it ""actual truth"". It appeared to be an endorsement of a racist and antisemitic conspiracy theory known as ""white genocide,"" which argues that Jewish people systematically plot to encourage immigration of ""non-white"" people to Western countries in order to ""eliminate"" the white race. It prompted a significant backlash, with the White House among those denouncing Mr Musk's endorsement of the post. Mr Musk has denied his post was antisemitic and has said his comments referred not to all Jewish people but to groups like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who have been critical of the platform, and other unspecified groups.",2023-11-27T21:35:06.000Z

"Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza extended for two days, Qatar saysPublished27 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend the four-day truce in Gaza for another two days, mediator Qatar says. Hamas said the extension was ""under the same conditions"", which were for 50 Israeli hostages to be released in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners. Israel has yet to comment, but it had offered a day's pause in the fighting for every 10 Israeli hostages freed. It came as 11 hostages were released in the final exchange under the original deal that took effect on Friday. Israeli officials said three-year-old twins and their mother were among them, along with six more children, an 18-year-old and her mother. The Israeli military said they had crossed into Israeli territory. However all of the released children's fathers remained in Gaza. Those freed included people who also held French, German and Argentine nationality, Qatar said. Thirty-three Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli jails were due to be released under the truce deal. Hamas - which is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers - has freed 39 Israelis over the previous three days. In exchange, Israel has freed 117 Palestinian prisoners. Nineteen foreign nationals, one of whom has Israeli citizenship, have also been handed over by Hamas under separate agreements. The pause in the fighting is also allowing a big increase in deliveries of aid to Gaza, where there is a deepening humanitarian crisis. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza and imposed a siege in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since the war began. Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansariannounced on Monday afternoon on X, formerly known as Twitter, that ""as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian pause for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip"". White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US welcomed the extension. ""This humanitarian pause has already brought a halt to the fighting together with a surge of humanitarian assistance. Now, in order to extend the pause Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children over the next two days,"" he said. ""We would of course hope to see the pause extended further and that will depend upon Hamas continuing to release hostages."" Before the start of Monday's exchange, an Israeli official said that 184 people remained in captivity in Gaza, including 14 foreign nationals and 80 Israelis with dual citizenship. On Sunday, a Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas was prepared to release up to 40 additional hostages, which would mean a four-day extension under the terms offered by Israel. Israel was reported to be leaning towards a more gradual, day-by-day approach. And it has made it clear that it is preparing to resume the war in Gaza at the end of the process. ""At the end of the outline, we will go to realising our goals with full force: eliminating Hamas, ensuring that Gaza will not go back to being what it was and, of course, releasing all of our hostages,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement on Sunday evening. Earlier, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the agreement would be extended if Hamas was ""able to prove, to locate, and secure some of the hostages that are within the criteria of the first group, which is women and children"". But he warned that Hamas's ""very complicated structure"" presented a challenge for Qatari mediators, with the group's political leaders in Doha having to relay information to and from military commanders in Gaza.",2023-11-27T21:15:36.000Z

How Hamas built a force to attack Israel on 7 OctoberPublished27 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Five armed Palestinian groups joined Hamas in the deadly 7 October attack on Israel after training together in military-style exercises from 2020 onwards, BBC News analysis shows. The groups carried out joint drills in Gaza which closely resembled the tactics used during the deadly assault - including at a site less than 1km (0.6 miles) from the barrier with Israel - and posted them on social media. They practised hostage-taking, raiding compounds and breaching Israel's defences during these exercises, the last of which was held just 25 days before the attack. BBC Arabic and BBC Verify have collated evidence which shows how Hamas brought together Gaza's factions to hone their combat methods - and ultimately execute a raid into Israel which has plunged the region into war. On 29 December 2020, Hamas's overall leader Ismail Haniyeh declared the first of four drills codenamed Strong Pillar a ""strong message and a sign of unity"" between Gaza's various armed factions. As the most powerful of Gaza's armed groups, Hamas was the dominant force in a coalition which brought together 10 other Palestinian factions in a war games-style exercise overseen by a ""joint operation room"". The structure was set up in 2018 to coordinate Gaza's armed factions under a central command. Prior to 2018, Hamas had formally coordinated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Gaza's second largest armed faction and - like Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries. Hamas had also fought alongside other groups in previous conflicts, but the 2020 drill was billed in propaganda as evidence a wider array of groups were being unified. Hamas's leader said the first drill reflected the ""permanent readiness"" of the armed factions. The 2020 exercise was the first of four joint drills held over three years, each of which was documented in polished videos posted on public social media channels. The BBC has visually identified 10 groups, including PIJ, by their distinctive headbands and emblems training alongside Hamas during the Strong Pillar drills in footage posted on the messaging app Telegram. Following the 7 October attack, five of the groups went on to post videos claiming to show them taking part in the assault. Three others issued written statements on Telegram claiming to have participated. The role of these groups has come into sharp focus as pressure builds on Hamas to find dozens of women and children believed to have been taken as captives from Israel into Gaza by other factions on 7 October. Three groups - PIJ, the Mujahideen Brigades and Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades - claim to have seized Israeli hostages, alongside Hamas, on that day. Efforts to extend the temporary truce in Gaza were said to be hinging on Hamas locating those hostages. While these groups are drawn from a broad ideological spectrum ranging from hard-line Islamist to relatively secular, all shared a willingness to use violence against Israel. Hamas statements repeatedly stressed the theme of unity between Gaza's disparate armed groups. The group suggested they were equal partners in the joint drills, whilst it continued to play a leading role in the plans to attack Israel. Footage from the first drill shows masked commanders in a bunker appearing to conduct the exercise, and begins with a volley of rocket fire. It cuts to heavily armed fighters overrunning a mocked-up tank marked with an Israeli flag, detaining a crew member and dragging him away as a prisoner, as well as raiding buildings. We know from videos and harrowing witness statements that both tactics were used to capture soldiers and target civilians on 7 October, when around 1,200 people were killed and an estimated 240 hostages were taken. The second Strong Pillar drill was held almost exactly one year later. Ayman Nofal, a commander in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - the official name for Hamas's armed wing - said the aim of the exercise on 26 December 2021 was to ""affirm the unity of the resistance factions"". He said the drills would ""tell the enemy that the walls and engineering measures on the borders of Gaza will not protect them"". Another Hamas statement said the ""joint military manoeuvres"" were designed to ""simulate the liberation of settlements near Gaza"" - which is how the group refers to Israeli communities. The exercise was repeated on 28 December 2022, and propaganda images of fighters practising clearing buildings and overrunning tanks in what appears to be a replica of a military base were published to mark the event. The exercises were reported on in Israel, so it's inconceivable they were not being closely monitored by the country's extensive intelligence agencies. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have previously carried out air strikes to disrupt Hamas's training activities. In April 2023, they bombed the site used for the first Strong Pillar drill. Weeks before the attacks, female surveillance soldiers near the Gaza border reportedly warned of unusually high drone activity and that Hamas was training to take over observation posts with replicas of their positions. But,according to reports in the Israeli media, they say they were ignored. Brigadier General Amir Avivi, a former IDF deputy commander in Gaza, told the BBC:  ""There was a lot of intelligence that they were doing this training - after all, the videos are public, and this was happening just hundreds of metres from the fence (with Israel)."" But he said while the military knew about the drills, they ""didn't see what they were training for"". The IDF said they ""eliminated"" Nofal on 17 October 2023, the first senior Hamas military leader to be killed during the conflict. Hamas went to great lengths to make sure the drills were realistic. In 2022, fighters practised storming a mock Israeli military base built just 2.6km (1.6 miles) from the Erez crossing, a route between Gaza and Israel controlled by the IDF. BBC Verify has pinpointed the site in the far north of Gaza, just 800m (0.5 miles) from the barrier, by matching geographic features seen in the training footage to aerial images of the area. As of November 2023, the site was still visible on Bing Maps. The training camp was within 1.6km (1 mile) of an Israeli observation tower and an elevated observation box, elements in a security barrier Israel has spent hundreds of millions of dollars constructing. The mock base is on land dug several metres below ground level, so it may not have been immediately visible to any nearby Israeli patrols - but the smoke rising from the explosions surely would have been, and the IDF is known to use aerial surveillance. Hamas used this site to practise storming buildings, taking hostages at gunpoint and destroying security barriers. BBC Verify has used publicly available information - including satellite imagery - to locate 14 training sites at nine different locations across Gaza. They even trained twice at a site less than 1.6 km (1 mile) from the United Nations' aid agency distribution centre, and which was visible in the background of an official video published by the agency in December 2022. On 10 September 2023, the so-called joint committee room published images on its dedicated Telegram channel of men in military uniforms carrying out surveillance of military installations along the Gaza barrier. Two days later, the fourth Strong Pillar military exercise was staged, and by 7 October, all the tactics that would be deployed in the unprecedented attack had been rehearsed. Fighters were filmed riding in the same type of white Toyota pickup trucks which were seen roaming through southern Israel the following month. The propaganda video shows gunmen raiding mock buildings and firing at dummy targets inside, as well as training to storm a beach using a boat and underwater divers. Israel has said it repelled attempted Hamas boat landings on its shores on 7 October. However, Hamas did not publicise its training with motorcycles and paragliders as part of the Strong Pillar propaganda. A training video posted by Hamas three days after 7 October shows fences and barriers being demolished to allow motorcycles to pass through, a tactic they used to reach communities in southern Israel. We have not identified similar earlier videos. Footage of fighters using paragliding equipment was also not published until the 7 October attack was under way. In a training video shared on the day of the attack, gunmen are seen landing in a mock kibbutz at an airstrip we have located to a site north of Rafah in southern Gaza. BBC Verify established it was recorded some time before 25 August 2022, and was stored in a computer file titled Eagle Squadron, the name Hamas uses for its aerial division - suggesting the paragliders plan was in the works for over a year. Before 7 October, Hamas was thought to have about 30,000 fighters in the Gaza Strip, according to reports quoting IDF commanders. It was also thought that Hamas could draw on several thousands of fighters from smaller groups. Hamas is by far the most powerful of the Palestinian armed groups, even without the support of other factions - suggesting its interest in galvanising the factions was driven by an attempt to secure broad support within Gaza at least as much as bolstering its own numbers. The IDF has previously estimated 1,500 fighters joined the 7 October raids. TheTimes of Israelreported earlier this month the IDF now believes the number was closer to 3,000. Whatever the true number, it means only a relatively small fraction of the total number of armed operatives in Gaza took part. It is not possible to verify precise numbers for how many fighters from smaller groups took part in the attack or the Strong Pillar drills. While Hamas was building cross-faction support in the build-up to the attack, Hisham Jaber, a former Brigadier General in the Lebanese army who is now a security analyst at the Middle East Centre for Studies and Research, said he believed only Hamas was aware of the ultimate plan, and it was ""probable [they] asked other factions to join on the day"". Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer in security studies at Kings College London, told the BBC: ""While there was centralised planning, execution was de-centralised, with each squad operationalising the plan as they saw fit."" He said people inside Hamas were said to be surprised by the weakness of Israel's defences, and assessed militants had likely bypassed Israel's surveillance technology by communicating offline. Hugh Lovatt, a Middle East analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel would have been aware of the joint training drills but ""reached the wrong conclusion"", assessing they amounted to the ""standard"" activity of paramilitary groups in the Palestinian territories, rather than being ""indicative of a looming large-scale attack"". Asked about the issues raised in this article, the Israel Defense Forces said it was ""currently focused on eliminating the threat from the terrorist organisation Hamas"" and questions about any potential failures ""will be looked into in a later stage"". It could be several years until Israel formally reckons with whether it missed opportunities to prevent the 7 October massacre. The ramifications for its military, intelligence services and government could be seismic. Additional reporting by Paul Brown, Kumar Malhotra and Abdirahim Saeed. Video production by Soraya Auer.

Israel-Gaza war: The Red Cross's delicate role in hostage crisesPublished27 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"With intense focus on the hostages released by Hamas, a quiet but crucial part has been played by an organisation at the centre of their handover, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Footage of the releases shows Red Cross staff, in their distinctive white vests emblazoned with its internationally recognised emblem, taking the hostages from masked gunmen, carefully helping them into their vehicles, giving them first aid and even playing with children in their first moments of freedom. The organisation was in contact with Hamas ever since it seized about 240 people during its massive attack on Israel on 7 October and took them back to Gaza. It has repeatedly called for their release, or at least to allow the ICRC to visit them. So far, 58 hostages - 40 Israeli and 12 Thais - have been released to the ICRC. The organisation was not involved in the negotiations around the terms for a release, but was standing by to facilitate the release once those terms had been agreed. From Israel, there has been some criticism that the ICRC has not done more. But the organisation said ""the ICRC cannot force its way in to where hostages are held, nor do we know their location"". The statement reflects frustration in Geneva that not everyone understands what the Red Cross can and cannot do. It is trying to fulfil its traditional role under the Geneva Conventions, asking to visit the hostages, deliver medical supplies, and bring news to desperate families. None of that can happen unless both Hamas and Israel agree. The ICRC is unarmed, and relies entirely on the trust of the warring parties - and civilians caught up in conflict - to carry out its work. And in the same way as it has transported hostages out of Gaza, it has also taken to their West Bank homes Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange. The logistics are a complicated but the ICRC is no stranger to such complexities. Last year it facilitated the release of almost 900 prisoners in Yemen held by Houthi rebels and Saudi-backed government troops. The operation took two days; the ICRC visited each prisoner to ensure they were well enough to travel and actually wanted to return home and then chartered planes to fly into conflict zones to pick them up. At the time Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC's regional director for the Middle East, admitted how relieved he had been that the exchange went quite smoothly. Often, he said, the life of an aid worker is ""about frustration… it's about saying more often 'no' than 'yes'"". The preparations the ICRC has been making for the Gaza hostages are part of a long history. In the Red Cross museum in Geneva, there is an archive of six million registration cards, with details of the prisoners and the missing from two world wars. It's a fascinating collection: one card confirms that Charles de Gaulle, France's World War Two leader and later its president, had been taken prisoner at the battle of Verdun in 1916. Others show the anxiety of mothers looking for their sons, and the sad replies confirming they had been killed. The collection illustrates the ICRC's key role under the Geneva Conventions: tracing the dead and missing, visiting prisoners of war, checking on their welfare, and exchanging messages between POWs and their families. In a quiet building in the hills above Geneva, the Red Cross tracing agency is now doing exactly the same for Russian and Ukrainian families as the war resulting from Moscow's full-scale invasion in 2022 continues. But in the century between World War One and today, the ICRC's work has expanded. Warfare has changed. Traditional armies are often replaced by armed militias, and civilians as well as fighters are detained, abducted or simply go missing. The Red Cross aim remains the same: to bring news of missing loved ones, and - if possible - to reunite families separated by war. During Nelson Mandela's long imprisonment in apartheid South Africa, the ICRC visited him regularly on Robben Island. Until the Good Friday agreement for peace and power sharing in Northern Ireland, the ICRC visited members of paramilitary groups who had been imprisoned there. The Red Cross also helps with prisoner exchanges, and the release of those abducted or taken hostage. When hundreds of schoolgirls were abducted by Boko Haram in Nigeria in 2014, the ICRC helped facilitate the release of some of them two years later. But, as with the hostages in Gaza now, supporting, or facilitating, did not mean negotiating. ""We were not involved in the negotiation for their release… we transferred the girls with the agreement of both parties involved,"" the ICRC said at the time. Mr Carboni, who accompanied his boss Mirjana Spoljaric to Qatar earlier this week, explained how the Red Cross sees its fundamental role, relatively unchanged for more than a century. ""I look at my kids, I look at my brothers, and I say 'imagine now there is a front line between us, they are captured, and I can't see them'. Or worse, you have no news, you don't know. ""So when we manage to reunite people, it's something hard to describe, this sense of purpose,"" he says.",2023-11-27T16:02:15.000Z

Israel-Lebanon border: The Irish troops watching Israel’s hidden conflictPublished27 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"""If you hear an alarm sounding it means you need to run to the nearest bunker,"" says Captain Aódhan McGuinness as we arrive at Camp Shamrock. He is the tactical operations director for the Irish troops who run this UN peacekeeping base close to the Lebanon-Israel border. We can hear the buzz of Israeli drones hovering overhead. They sound like hair dryers or electric razors, and are now a constant presence day and night above towns and villages in southern Lebanon. A loud explosion nearby interrupts Captain McGuinness' safety briefing. ""Ok, today's round has started,"" he says. The blast is yet another sign of escalating tensions in the area since Hamas launched its unprecedented assault on Israel back in October. The UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil, is responsible for monitoring the Blue Line, the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel. During the last four decades the area has witnessed on and off clashes between the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group, Hezbollah, and the Israeli army. While Hezbollah is labelled a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and others, it is a mainstream political party in Lebanon, leading an alliance which fell just short of a majority in the national parliament in elections last year. Wearing body armour and helmets we join a group of heavily armed peacekeepers in a convoy of armoured vehicles for a 20-minute drive to another base that is just 500m (1,600ft) from the Blue Line. With Israeli military installations visible across the frontier, the commander of the outpost, Lieutenant Dylan Cadogan, says they often have to take shelter in bunkers during strikes, sometimes for hours. ""We have seen houses destroyed and we have seen civilians caught in crossfire that needed our help."" From the base's watchtower he points at a pink house in the distance: ""There was a mother and a child in that building only 400m (1,300ft) from us. ""Their house was shelled, and they had to run here to take refuge and we provided them with medical support and took them to safety."" The Unifil troops have recovered the bodies of people killed in the fighting but cannot say how many were Hezbollah fighters due to the sensitivity of their mission and the need to remain neutral between the warring parties. ""It is not our job to comment on these, just observe, monitor and report what we see to our headquarters,"" Lieutenant Cadogan says. Since Israel launched its offensive on Gaza following Hamas's attack on 7 October, Hezbollah has regularly carried out rocket and drone attacks from southern Lebanon, some aimed at military targets, others fired more indiscriminately into northern Israel. Israeli forces have retaliated with heavy air strikes and artillery fire. Due to the fighting 60,000 people have been displaced from the border area on the Lebanese side, while thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from northern Israel. Monitoring groups say that in the first week following Hamas's attack in October there were around 70 reported incidents near the Blue Line, and by mid-November it had risen to about 250 attacks a week. The peacekeeping force was first deployed in 1978 after Israel invaded southern Lebanon in response to cross border attacks from there by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). Since then, more than 300 peacekeepers have been killed, 48 of them Irish, something which is on the minds of the troops' families. Captain Tony Smith, 27, on his second deployment, regularly reassures his relatives back home in Wexford, in south east Ireland. ""Of course my mother wants me to go home now, which eventually I will, but she knows why we are here and despite her concerns she supports that."" Approaching the nearby town of Tebnine, posters of Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah and fallen Hezbollah fighters line the road. It's 10km (6.2 miles) from the Blue Line and has been heavily damaged in previous conflicts. Like most of the towns and villages in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is very influential here and controls security in the area. One of the local residents, 57-year-old Ali Saad, says he grew up with the Irish Unifil soldiers. Speaking with a distinctive Irish accent, Ali says one peacekeeper helped teach him English when he was a young boy. That soldier was one of three generations of the same Irish family to serve with Unifil. His father also served several decades ago, and his son is currently stationed in Lebanon. Ali credits the Irish troops with helping to save his life when they picked him up from school and took him to one of their bunkers during an air strike. In the years since, he has worked as a translator for Unifil and a group of Irish soldiers even attended his wedding to his wife, Bassima, who also helps the peacekeepers with language services. But while Ali values the troops' presence, he is sad that the conflict they are there to monitor has dragged on so long. ""To be honest we never thought this mission would last for over 44 years,"" he says. For Bassima the current fighting has brought back painful memories of earlier conflicts, like the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. ""I was putting my younger son inside an empty washing machine because I was hoping that it could project him,"" she says. ""Now, we keep hearing all these sounds of explosions and I just can't take it."" She believes that growing up surrounded by conflict has affected her son, who is now 23. He still gets nervous when Unifil helicopters fly overhead. ""We can't go back to where we were,"" she adds. ""We are wasting our life from one conflict to another, I just cannot go through another war."" Back at the base, Unifil commander Lieutenant Colonel Cathal Keohane is concerned that the level of violence in the area has been increasing. ""We have seen an expansion and more attacks deeper inside to Lebanon, we have seen a wider range of weapons being used,"" he says, worrying that the situation could escalate. ""Whether it arises deliberately from one side, or some inadvertent circumstances precipitate the outbreak of all-out war, that is a serious concern for us."" He hopes that the ceasefire in Gaza will lead to an easing of tensions around the Blue Line, but says it could take displaced people some time to return to their homes, even if the cross border fire ends.",2023-11-27T10:37:33.000Z

More Palestinian teen prisoners freed amid hopes of extended hostage dealPublished27 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A further 39 Palestinians have been freed from Israeli prisons in the third exchange for hostages being held in Gaza. They were released as part of an agreement which has seen 40 Israeli hostages taken on 7 October returned. It brings the total number of Palestinians released since the first swap on Friday to 117. A last exchange is expected on Monday under the current deal agreed by Israel and Hamas, but it could be extended. Among the latest Palestinian prisoners to be freed was teenagerMohammed Al-Awar,who spent 16 months in jail. His mother said she had mixed feelings about his release. ""Our joy is incomplete because of the huge number of people killed in Gaza,"" she said in a video showing their reunion. Another teenager,Abdurahman Al-Zaghal, was also freed but was not with the others as he is in an Israeli hospital receiving medical treatment. He was shot in the head and hit by shrapnel in the lower part of his body in August as he went out to buy bread, according to his uncle. Israeli authorities said he was trying to throw a petrol bomb on a settlement post in the area. Al-Zaghal's trial was held in absentia as he was still in intensive care. He was seen on Sunday removing an electronic bracelet from his leg. As in the earlier nights of prisoner swaps, large crowds took to the streets in the West Bank - where detainees are being returned to initially - to greet the coaches carrying the released prisoners. Footage shows some of those released being paraded around on people's shoulders, while other members of the crowd wave Palestinian flags. Israel has compiled a list of 300 Palestinian prisoners, mainly teenage boys, who are eligible for release under the deal struck with Hamas. Under a deal brokered with the help of Qatar, 50 Israeli hostages - women and children - were to be freed by Hamas over four days during a ceasefire, in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners. Some 40 Israeli hostages in total have been freed so far, alongside 18 foreign nationals. Israel previously said the ceasefire could be extended if at least 10 Israelis were released daily. However, the government has vowed to wipe out Hamas and added that any cessation in its attacks was only temporary. Hamas said on Sunday that it wanted to extend the agreement and increase the number of hostages released. A senior Palestinian official familiar with negotiations taking place in Qatar told the BBC the group has informed mediators it is willing to extend the pause by two to four days, and that an extension could see the release of an additional 20 to 40 Israeli prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the framework deal as a ""blessed thing"", also apparently hinting that it could be extended. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman told the Financial Times that the group would need to locate dozens of hostages held in Gaza by other groups in order to secure an extension. Many of those kidnapped in the 7 October attacks - thought to be about 240 people - are being held by Hamas, an Iran-backed Islamist group that is categorised as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and the European Union. However, groups including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which also participated, are believed to be holding some. Some 1,200 people, most of them civilians were killed in the 7 October raid, according to Israel. In retaliation for the attack, Israel has bombed Gaza relentlessly, wrecking its infrastructure. Hamas says nearly 15,000 people have died, including many children. Large supplies of aid - notably food, water and hygiene kits - are desperately needed.",2023-11-27T00:21:22.000Z

Avigail Idan: Four-year-old girl among released hostagesPublished26 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A four-year-old Israeli-American girl who was kidnapped by Hamas during its 7 October attack in southern Israel was among the 17 hostages released by the group on Sunday. Avigail Idanwas just three at the time she was taken hostage from her home, where her parents were attacked and killed by Hamas gunmen. She turned four while she was held hostage by Hamas. Avigail's family said: ""We hoped and prayed today would come."" ""There are no words to express our relief and gratitude that Avigail is safe and coming home,"" said Liz Hirsh Naftali, Avigail's great aunt, and Noa Naftali, her cousin, in a statement. They also thanked US president Joe Biden, the Qatari government and others who were involved in securing Avigail's release and called for the remaining hostages to be released. ""We have to keep pushing. We will continue to stand with the families of all the hostages still held captive, and we remain committed as ever to securing their safe and swift return."" Earlier, President Biden said Avigail had been through a ""terrible trauma"", adding what she ""endured is unthinkable"". Speaking to reporters, he said those around Avigail will be surrounding her with ""love and care."" ""Today she's free, and Jilly [first lady of the US Jill Biden] and I, together with so many Americans, are praying for the fact that she is going to be alright,"" he said. President Biden said Sunday's hostage releases were the result of ""intensive US diplomacy"", adding he was hopeful that more American hostages will be released in the coming days. ""We continue to press and expect that additional Americans will be released as well,"" he said, adding ""we will not stop working until every hostage is returned to their loved ones"". Fourteen of the 17 hostages were Israeli and three of them were Thai nationals. Nine of the Israelis were children. Avigail was with her family in the Kfar Aza kibbutz on 7 October. Her parents were killed during the attack, while her two siblings hid and were later rescued. Her mother's cousin told Sky News that Avigail's father had been holding her when he was shot. She survived and walked to the home of her neighbours, the Brodutch family, but was later abducted along with the family by Hamas. Some members of the Brodutch family were among the hostages released on Sunday, including four-year-oldOria, his eight-year-old brotherYuvaland their 10-year-old sisterOfri. Their mother, 40-year-oldHagar Brodutchwas also released. Hagar's father-in-law, Shmuel Brodutch, told Israel's Channel 13 News: ""The moment I heard they were in the hands of the Red Cross, I was relieved."" He added: ""I hope I can invest the same effort until the last captive returns. I am very happy, but I feel a great commitment to the other families until the last captive returns, including IDF soldiers."" The other released hostages includeChen Almog-Goldstein, 48, and her childrenTal, eight,Gal, 11, andAgam, 17, who were abducted from their homes in Kfar Aza on the day of the attack. Chen's husband, Nadav, and their 20-year-old daughter, Yam, were killed by Hamas. Also released were sistersDafnaandEla Elyakim, aged 15 and eight respectively. They were taken from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the day of the attack, and were part of a family group whose capture waslive-streamed by the attackers themselves. Their mother, Maayan Zin, said in a statement that she was happy her daughters had returned, adding that it was ""a joy mixed with sadness"". ""Joy for my daughters who are here and sadness for those who have not yet returned. My heart will not be whole again until everyone returns home safely."" She said that since the girls were kidnapped, she had been living ""between despair and hope, between pain and optimism"". ""The girls are returning to a new and complex situation, and now we have a period of recovery that will take time,"" she said. The other hostages released were 25-year-oldRoni Krivoi- a dual Israeli-Russian national, working as a sound engineer at the Supernova music festival, 62-year-oldAdrienne Aviva Seigelwho was taken from her home in Kfar Aza along with her 64-year-old husband Keith. IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari confirmed that 84-year-oldElma Avrahamwas airlifted to Soroka hospital in Beersheba in a serious condition. Israel's prison service meanwhile has confirmed the release of 39 Palestinian prisoners as part of the four-day truce between Hamas and Israel. Hamas' attack on 7 October killed 1,200 people, and about 240 were taken hostage. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 14,500 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory campaign in the territory. Sunday marks the third day of a four-day pause in fighting in Gaza during which some of those being held hostage by Hamas are being freed in return for the release of Palestinian prisoners. The total number of hostages released during the window now stands at 54 and the number of prisoners freed is 117.",2023-11-26T21:16:27.000Z

Slick videos or more 'authentic' content? The Israel-Gaza battles raging on TikTok and XPublished26 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Young or old. TikTok or X. Pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian. Your social media feeds are unique to you. Could they be shaping how you view the Israel-Gaza war? When I open up my TikTok feed, two videos play one after the other. The first shows four Israeli soldiers dancing with guns, set against a blue sky. The other is a young woman speaking from her bedroom, with a prominent pro-Palestinian caption. TikTok's algorithm will determine what kind of videos I want to see and recommend similar content, based on which of the two videos I watch until the end. The algorithms work in a similar way for other social media platforms too and it means some users are being driven towards increasingly divisive content about Israel and Gaza that only entrench their existing views and biases. It matters because conversations on social media can shape public opinion - and normalise rhetoric that spills offline, at protests and beyond. That includes the UK, where social media seems to have encouraged many people who are not normally politically active, to take action. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, whose mother is Palestinian, tells me she and other politicians are receiving a ""huge influx"" of messages including from young people urging a ceasefire. They seem to have been inspired to act because of ""TikTok videos and Instagram reels shared around over WhatsApp"". ""Anything that is too slick, their initial instinct seems to be - don't trust it. They expect it to be disinformation,"" the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon says. Conservative MP Andrew Percy, the vice chair of the Conservative Friends of Israel group, says the war has ""garnered less engagement and communication from residents"" in his constituency than other issues. However, he says: ""Much of the content being shared is problematically antisemitic. That's been a real problem long before this conflict - and this time, social media has made that happen at speed."" So what is getting the most traction on TikTok, and with whom? My TikTok feed is constantly punctuated with videos that are categorically pro-Israel or pro-Palestinian - with opposing sides often critiquing each other's content. And it's pro-Palestinian content that seems to be proving more popular with Gen Z users - people born between 1997 and 2012. Videos on TikTok using the hashtag ""istandwithisrael"" have racked up more than 240 million views, compared with more than 870 million views for videos using the term ""istandwithpalestine"". That's similar to other video-based sites popular with younger users. Many of these videos have been posted since Hamas - proscribed as a terrorist group by the UK and other governments - attacked Israel on 7 October, but some pre-date that time. There is a noticeable contrast between what the most popular content supporting either side looks like. For example, videos from bloggers on the ground in Gaza - and pro-Palestinian users commenting on the Israel-Gaza war from their bedrooms - provoke the most positive reaction among younger users. Meanwhile, content from soldiers with the Israeli Defense Forces appears more polished and curated - trying to play into viral TikTok trends. Questions remain about just how much either side - whether the Israeli government or Hamas, which runs Gaza - is involved in encouraging or directing unofficial content. I tracked down several TikTokkers to find out more, including an Israeli soldier called Daniel. His most viral video, with 2.1 million views, shows him and three other soldiers - who are currently serving with the armed forces - dancing with guns several days after the 7 October attacks. Since then, his videos have had fewer views, over 10,000 each but nothing like the initial 2 million. It can be tricky to predict when a video will go viral on TikTok. A consistent reduction in views could indicate users are not as receptive to these videos as they were before - especially as violence unfolds in Gaza - and as a consequence such videos are not being recommended as widely. It's also worth pointing out that a high number of views doesn't necessarily correlate with a positive reception, either. Videos can be shared and widely criticised. Users on TikTok often ""stitch"" posts - where they re-post a video, alongside one of themselves reacting to it. The Global Story A brand new podcast to help you cut through the headlines, with Katya Adler. Listen to the first episode, featuring Marianna Spring, on BBC Sounds I spotted this happening with some of Daniel's content. Both in re-posted ""stitches"", and in comments below Daniel's own posts, people were suggesting his dancing videos were disrespectful to civilians being killed in Gaza. One user commented ""shameless"" while another said: ""The more you show your cruelty in the eyes of the world."" Daniel told me the reaction to his content has been split between ""supportive users"" and then those who share hate and, at times, antisemitic abuse. Abusive remarks on his videos, and other posts about Israel, have included comments from pro-Hamas accounts falsely claiming that the hostages taken on 7 October were actually paid actors or killed by Israeli forces. ""I am not taking personally the hate reactions because, first of all, I did nothing wrong, [and] second, people around the world are so dedicated to hate Israel so it doesn't matter what [is] in my content,"" Daniel explained. In a recent meeting with TikTok executives, comic actor Sacha Baron Cohen accused the site of ""creating the biggest antisemitic movement since the Nazis"". He is not the only Jewish celebrity to have expressed concerns in the wake of the 7 October attacks. In a recent blog post, TikTok said: ""Our recommendation algorithm doesn't 'take sides' and has rigorous measures in place to prevent manipulation."" The social media company also told us that from 7 October to 17 November it had removed more than 1.1m videos in the conflict region for breaking its rules - including content promoting Hamas, hate speech, terrorism and misinformation. Its community guidelines prohibit ""content that promotes Islamophobia or antisemitism"", which TikTok says it takes action against. When I take a look at pro-Palestinian content, some creators' videos have a different style. Ariana, who shares videos on the war from her home in the US, often talks straight into the camera in her bedroom. She gives her opinion on war-related posts from celebrities or on images coming out of Gaza. ""When I first started posting about Palestine [after 7 October], my views decreased. I lost a lot of followers,"" Ariana explained to me, describing criticism from users supportive of Israel. But she began to get more engagement on TikTok in the following weeks, when she started posting more about what she believes is Israeli-propaganda. ""People started discovering me and so the numbers started shooting up,"" she says. She says, for the most part, she has been ""receiving a lot of support"" online, especially from people who ""felt like they couldn't trust traditional media"". But she has also experienced Islamophohic hate, not just on TikTok - but on Instagram and other social media platforms. Both Daniel and Ariana say their content has not been sponsored by political actors or other groups. When users are pushed more and more content that confirms a particular narrative, it becomes easier to understand how more extreme ideas can start to gain traction. This happened recently on TikTok, when several Gen Z users began to promote Osama Bin Laden's 2002 ""Letter to America"" - which he wrote as his justification for the 11 September terrorist attacks, that killed 3,000 people in the US. Those postings were essentially suggesting that Bin Laden's perspective was not without merit, and offered an alternative view on the US's involvement in Middle East conflicts. But they didn't reference the original letter's antisemitic remarks and homophobic rhetoric. TikTok said that the number of videos about the letter was small but that interest was amplified after they were posted to X, formerly Twitter. TikTok has since removed videos and blocked ""Letter to America"" from its search function. On longer-established platforms like X, it's a different picture. The platform has been accused of allowing the spread of violent, hateful and misleading content. Its relatively new owner, Elon Musk, has also been criticised over his response to posts promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories. Mr Musk has since insisted he's not antisemitic and the social media company has defended its approach to harmful content. But - in contrast to TikTok - X has traditionally been a platform popular with politicians and journalists. It would appear pro-Israeli content is still having significant reach in this circle. The curated content - including emotional videos about hostages taken by Hamas - shared by the State of Israel's account seems to have accumulated huge numbers of views, according to X's own data. For example, between 16 and 21 November the official account had racked up over 40 million views on X. In comparison, the official account on X for the Palestinian mission to the UN has had just over 200,000 views on its own posts over the same period, and has far fewer followers. And I have found evidence that official accounts on X have also been spreading disinformation. In October, State of Israel posted false claims that the body of a four year-old Palestinian boy killed by Israeli strikes was just a doll. A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in the UK did not comment directly on these social media posts or on the circumstances of the child's death. False claims have also been spread by accounts that support Hamas. However, in the absence of official accounts with large followers, these mistruths seem to have unfolded in a more dispersed way online. Take, for example, comments suggesting that a different four-year-old boy, an Israeli, who was killed when Hamas attacked his home, had been a ""paid actor"". Then there's Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook. It has come under pressure amid claims of over-zealous moderation of content about the war. For example, an Instagram account with more than six million followers called @eye.on.Palestine - which posts images and videos showing violence against civilians in Gaza during Israeli airstrikes - was suspended by the platform for several days. Meta later said this was for ""security reasons after signs of compromise"". Several people sharing pro-Palestine content on Instagram have also posted examples of where they say their accounts have been restricted from adding comments to posts, for example, without a clear indication as to why.",2023-11-26T21:07:35.000Z

Emily Hand among Gaza hostages freed on SaturdayPublished26 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A nine-year-old Irish-Israeli girl is among the latest hostages to be freed by Hamas in the Israel-Gaza conflict. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed Emily Hand isone of 17 people handed over late on Saturday. The Israel Prison Service said 41 Palestinians had been freed under the hostage agreement. Emily's father Tom Hand said the family could not ""find the words to describe our emotions after 50 challenging and complicated days"". ""We are happy to hug Emily again, but at the same time, we remember Raya Rotem and all of the hostages who have yet to come back. We will continue to do everything in our power to bring them back home,"" he said. He said thanked everyone who ""helped and hugged us"" while Emily was held. Tánaiste (Irish deputy PM) Micheál Martin said ""a bright and beautiful girl"" had been released. He said it was ""a precious and deeply moving moment for the Hand family"". ""The people of Ireland have been touched by Emily's story, innocence and the quiet dignity and determination of her father Tom,"" Mr Martin said. He said he had met Mr Hand and had been ""struck by the strength and resilience with which he advocated for his daughter's release"". ""This is a message that I and my colleagues in government sought to amplify as we engaged internationally though political, diplomatic and security channels in a bid to secure Emily's safe return,"" he added. Four Thai nationals who had been held hostage in Gaza were also freed on Saturday night. In a statement the Israeli prime minister's office said: ""The Israeli government embraces the 17 abductees who returned to Israel, 13 of our citizens and four Thai citizens who returned to Israel today."" An earlier delay to a release of hostages was resolved following mediation with Egypt and Qatar. Mr Martin said he wanted to acknowledge the role played by the ""US, Qatar, Egypt and others that have been involved"" in securing Emily's release. However, he added that he was aware ""many more hostages remain in the hands of Hamas,"" and called for all of them to be released. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said ""prayers had been answered"". ""This is a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily Hand and her family,"" he said. ""An innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned, and we breathe a massive sigh of relief."" However,his post has been criticised by Israel Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who accused him of losing his moral compass. ""Emily Hand was not 'lost', she was kidnapped by a terror organisation worse than ISIS that murdered her stepmother,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. He later wrote that he had ""summoned the Irish ambassador to Israel for a reprimand"" following Mr Varadkar's ""outrageous"" comments. It is unclear when the ambassador, Sonya McGuinness, will be summoned or what action will be taken. Meanwhile, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald also welcomed the news of Emily Hand's release. ""The trauma and heartbreak that little Emily and her family have been subjected to over the last number of weeks is unimaginable,"" she said. ""I commend the mediators' efforts, including the government of Qatar and all other neighbouring states, for the constructive role that they have played in securing the release of Emily and the other hostages, as well as Palestinian women and children who were imprisoned under administrative detention, who are finally reuniting with their loved ones today."" She called for all hostages be released urgently and for an immediate full ceasefire to be in place. The released hostages arrived in Israel on Saturday night, the country's military said. Israel Defence Forces said the hostages had undergone an initial medical assessment before being taken to hospitals and reunited with their families. Emily had been held without any of her family with her. Her father spoke at a press conference in London on Monday, crying as he said he was sure his daughter would be asking every day: ""Where's my daddy, why didn't he come to save me?"" Mr Hand has been campaigning around the world for his daughter's release. He had originally been told she had been killed. She turned nine while being held by Hamas. He said he realised it would take a long time to fix the mental trauma his little girl will have suffered. Israel's military began attacking Gaza after Hamas fighters crossed the border on 7 October, killing 1,200 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 14,500 people have been killed in Gaza - more than a third of them children - since Israel began its retaliatory action. Under the terms of the Israel-Hamas temporary truce, a total of 50 hostages will be released during a four-day pause in fighting which began on 24 November at 07:00 (05:00 GMT). Hamas said 150 Palestinian women and teenagers will be released from Israeli jails under the deal, and hundreds of lorries of humanitarian aid, medical supplies and fuel will be allowed into Gaza.",2023-11-26T19:11:15.000Z

Palestinian teenager 'dizzy with happiness' to be freedPublished26 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Thirty-nine Palestinian teenagers and women were freed from Israeli prisons on Saturday after the ceasefire deal looked to be in peril. They were released as part of an agreement which has seen 26Israeli hostages taken on 7 Octoberreturned. It takes the total number of Palestinians released since the start of the temporary ceasefire to 78. One of those released, Mohammad dar-Darwish, 17, said he was ""dizzy with happiness"" to return home. The exchange was delayed after Hamas accused Israel of changing the agreed list of prisoners it would release. Hamas also said that not enough aid shipments that had been guaranteed access to Gaza as part of the deal had made it through. But the handover went ahead after last-minute mediation involving Qatar and Egypt. Israel denied breaking the terms of the agreement, which entered its third day on Sunday. On Saturday night, a crowd of people - including some waving the green flag of Hamas - greeted a coach carrying released Palestinians as it made its way through the West Bank, where detainees are being returned to initially. Six of them were women, while all the others were under the age of 18. Among them wasMohammad dar-Darwish, who was held in an Israeli jail for seven months accused of throwing a petrol bomb at soldiers. He denies the charge. He said he was ""dizzy with happiness"" when he returned home and found his father and brother in the crowd waiting to greet the detainees. Speaking to the BBC, he claimed Palestinian prisoners were mistreated after the 7 October attack. Israel's prison service says it treats prisoners lawfully. Israel has compiled a list of 300 Palestinian prisoners, mainly teenage boys, who are eligible for release under the deal struck with Hamas. Most are in prison awaiting trial, with less than a quarter of those on the list having been convicted. Among the adult women released wasIsraa Jaabis, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2015 when her car burst into flames 1.5km (0.9 miles) from a checkpoint in the West Bank. Israel said it was an attempted car bombing and she was convicted, but Israa Jaabis - now 38 - denied the charge, and her family has previously claimed the fire started because of an engine fault. She suffered serious facial burns after the car's engine caught fire, but had requests for surgery turned down by Israel's prison authorities. After being released eight years into her sentence, she was pictured hugging her son Mua'tassim, 15, who was eight years old at the time of his mother's arrest. Some of those released under the ceasefire deal are prisoners who were still children when they were arrested. Marah Bakeerwas sentenced to eight-and-a-half years for a knife attack on a border police officer when she was 16. After returning to her family in East Jerusalem, she said ""I'm emotional, it's a very good feeling"", and said she only found out about her release hours before it happened. Nourhan Awad, 23, served eight years of her 10 year sentence before being released on Saturday. She was convicted over a stabbing in Jerusalem, and was shot by police during her arrest. Her cousin was shot and killed during the arrest. She was filmed running to her family in Qalandia, West Bank, after her release, and said she would visit the grave of her cousin before returning home. A second group of Israeli hostages - all women and children - werereleased from Gaza on Saturday evening. More detainees and hostages are set to be released on Sunday as part of the agreement.",2023-11-26T15:29:03.000Z

West Bank: Eight Palestinians killed during Israeli raidPublished26 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Eight Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The most serious incident was an Israeli raid overnight in the city of Jenin, in which five were killed. The Israeli army said it was mounting a raid to capture a Palestinian who was suspected of involvement in an ambush that killed two Israelis in August. Palestinian factions have called for a strike in Jenin to mourn those killed. The West Bank has seen almost daily clashes for more than a year and a half, after Israel suffered a wave of deadly violence by Palestinian militants. Israeli forces have gone into West Bank towns and cities in search of those suspected of being involved in shootings and stabbings or planning such attacks. Jenin has been a flashpoint, and hundreds of Palestinians - both fighters and civilians - have been killed. Back in July, Israeli forces launched an incursion into the city's refugee camp, which is regarded as a hotbed of militants. Thirteen Palestinians were killed in the fiercest confrontation in the West Bank for 20 years. In addition, Israeli settlers have responded to killings carried out by Palestinian gunmen with rampages in Palestinian towns and villages. So, the area was already at boiling point before the Hamas assault on Israel on 7 October. In the weeks since then, the UN says some 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or settlers in a new escalation of the conflict. Four Israelis have been killed by Palestinians. Even as Israel has been fighting a war with Hamas in Gaza, it has tightened its controls on the West Bank in a bid to prevent a spill-over of the conflict. But this appears only to have further undermined the Palestinian Authority and boosted the rise of militant groups in Jenin and beyond.",2023-11-26T14:16:08.000Z

"For many Israeli hostage families, the painful wait goes onPublished26 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Avi Shamriz was keeping busy during the day. No job was too small. The families in the hotel needed new clothes, new phones. The free shop needed be kept stocked. Movies for the kids. A birthday party. He wandered the grounds, checking in on people. ""I don't stop,"" he said. But at night, when the hotel was quiet and the small jobs were all done, Avi could no longer distract himself from thinking about his son. ""I'm thinking, is he safe? Are they treating him well? Does he have enough food? Is he sick, is he injured? Does he have clothes to wear? He is in a tunnel, do they have a shower? It must be dark there. Is it cold?"" Alon Shamriz, a 26-year-old student of computer engineering from the Kfar Aza kibbutz near the border with Gaza, is believed to have been taken hostage when Hamas stormed the kibbutz during its 7 October attack on Israel. This is what the family hopes - that he is in Gaza. They know that Alon was not found among the dead. On Friday afternoon, Avi and his family were sitting in the grounds of a hotel near Tel Aviv that is now home to about 400 people displaced from Kfar Aza. Dotted among the families at the hotel are a few like Avi's, with loved ones among the hostages. As Avi sat on his garden chair, describing his sleepless nights, all of Israel awaited the release of the first 13 hostages in a few hours' time, in exchange for 39 Palestinian prisoners. It was a day of mixed emotions. Dozens of families knew that their loved one would almost certainly not be among the 50 hostages due to be released as part of the deal struck between Israel and Hamas, because mothers and children had been prioritised. ""On one hand, I am happy that this has begun, because it might continue,"" Avi said. ""But right now I don't trust anyone. I don't trust Hamas, I don't trust my own government to keep doing the right thing. So, I have nothing. Only to wait."" All over Israel this weekend, families were bracing for footage of the first hostages being returned home, knowing that their pain and uncertainty would endure. Naama Weinberg, whose cousin Itai Svirsky, 38, is also believed to be among the hostages, watched the exchange from her apartment in Tel Aviv. ""I sat in front of the news for hours, my eyes glued to the screen,"" she said on Saturday. ""I was crying from happiness and joy, I texted the families of the people who came out to send them love."" But there was also some jealousy, she said. ""Itai is my cousin. He is my family. I want everyone back, of course, but I really want him back."" Along with some other hostage families, Naama's family is facing a daunting scenario: both of Itai's parents were killed in the attack but it isn't clear whether he knows. ""He was with his mother at the house when the attack happened, but we don't know what he saw,"" Naama said. ""Did he see her being murdered before he was taken? Or was he taken before she was murdered? ""Was her son being taken away the last thing my aunt saw?"" The family knew they would have to break it to Itai that his father, who was killed in a separate building, was gone. ""The healing process is going to be extremely difficult,"" Naama said, tears forming in her eyes. ""Itai is going to come home an orphan."" By the end of Monday, 50 Israeli hostages should have been released along with 15 foreign nationals, and 150 Palestinian detainees freed by Israel in return, facilitated by a four-day ceasefire. Israel has prioritised the release of the elderly, mothers, and children. About 150 Israelis will still be in Gaza, their families forced to endure longer. ""I want to hope, but I don't think she will be involved in this deal,"" said Yamit Ashkenazi, whose 30-year-old sister Doron, a veterinary nurse, is believed to be in Gaza. Like a few of the relatives, Yamit has a new tattoo. It reads, 'As the sun we will rise again,' but some of the sun's rays are missing. ""They will be added when she is home,"" Yamit said. Israeli authorities did not confirm to family members in advance whether their loved ones were expected to be released this weekend or not, but families like Yamit's - and Avi's and Naama's - had already reconciled themselves to the fact that their relatives did not fit the criteria. ""I am a mother also, so I understand why the children have to come out first,"" Yamit said. ""But Doron is my parents' young daughter. She is a human being. Behind every number there is a person with a story and relatives. So we must get them all back, not just certain categories."" Yamit and her parents were preparing on Saturday to travel to central Tel Aviv for a massive rally to call for all the hostages to be brought home. This rally was going to be particularly big, to coincide with the first hostage release, but Yamit's family had been going every Saturday to the newly renamed Hostages Square, to call for everyone to be brought back. Naama Weinberg was also at the rally. ""It's exhausting to fight this fight, but we can't quit until he's home,"" she said. ""Until all the hostages are home."" The exhaustion was visible on Naama's face, and on the faces of the other family members who were still waiting. They had endured 50 days of campaigning, of media appearances, of lying awake at night thinking about their loved ones in Gaza. The deal this weekend had given them some hope, they all said. But it also brought fear that something could go wrong. ""I'm scared that it might give the world the feeling that the trade is done, that we got some of the hostages back and it will all quiet down,"" Naama said. ""The situation is very sensitive, anyone can blow it,"" Avi Shamriz said. ""Someone says something wrong, somebody shoots someone, and we are back to square one."" And then there was the bombing of Gaza, Avi said. ""The government say they are being careful, but you cannot be careful when you are dropping bombs,"" he said. ""You just don't know who you are going to hit."" As the hostage families gathered with thousands of others in central Tel Aviv on Saturday night, Avi was back in his hotel room. He did not believe in the power of the rallies. He thought they were counter-productive. ""I am doing my best to do work behind the scenes,"" he said. He was also quietly preparing for his son's return. Alon's Toyota Camry was destroyed in the Hamas attack, so a few weeks ago Avi set up a fundraiser to buy him a new one. When Toyota Israel found out, it donated a used Camry for free. ""It doesn't have a sunroof like Alon's did, but that's OK,"" Avi said. ""It will be ready for him when he comes home.""

More hostages released by Hamas despite agonising delayPublished26 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A second group of Israeli hostages left Hamas captivity on Saturday, after hours of delay had increased the anxiety of desperate families. The Israeli military said 13 Israelis were released in Gaza and in exchange 39 more Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel in the West Bank. Hamas also released four Thai hostages. The first releases took place smoothly on Friday, under a temporary four-day truce deal brokered by Qatar. Urgent talks saved Saturday's handover. The Israelis had been expected to be handed over to the Red Cross on Gaza's border with Egypt at 16:00 (14:00 GMT). The Hamas armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said there were issues over the delivery of aid to northern Gaza and the selection criteria for Palestinian prisoners being exchanged for captives held by Hamas. Israel denied violating the terms of the deal. Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said a total of 340 aid trucks had gone into Gaza since Friday, but only 65 had reached northern Gaza - which he said was less than half of what Israel had agreed on. Israel describes the north as a war zone and says the UN is responsible for delivering the aid. Later a senior Palestinian official close to the talks confirmed Qatar's statement that the dispute had been resolved. And Hamas voiced ""appreciation towards Egypt and Qatar for ensuring the continuation of their temporary truce with Israel"". Under the deal, 50 Israeli hostages - women and children - are to be freed by Hamas over four days, in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners. The Israeli government says the truce could be extended if at least 10 Israelis are released daily - but it has also vowed to wipe out Hamas and insists the deal is only temporary. Hamas kidnapped about 240 people when it raided southern Israel on 7 October, and killed 1,200, most of them civilians, Israel says. The Iran-backed Islamist group is categorised as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and the European Union. In retaliation for the 7 October attack Israel has bombed Gaza relentlessly, wrecking its infrastructure. Hamas says nearly 15,000 people have died, including many children. Large supplies of aid - notably food, water and hygiene kits - are desperately needed. On Saturday evening some 50,000 people rallied in central Tel Aviv with the slogan ""Bring them back home"" on posters and t-shirts, hoping that the fragile truce would hold. Two of the Israeli hostages who were released late on Saturday were siblingsNoam and Alma Or, 17 and 13 respectively. In the 7 October attacks, they were seen by a neighbour being dragged out of their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, along with their father, according to their nephew. Their father has not been released. Their mother was killed in the attack, but the teenagers did not know this, their uncle, Ahal Besorai, told the BBC. ""We had to bring the sad news to them,"" he said. Dr Shoshan Haran, 67, was also kidnapped from Be'eri and released on Saturday. She is the founder of a not-for-profit organisation to help feed those in poverty and has a PhD in agronomy. She was freed along with her daughterAdi Shoham, 38, and her children,Nave, eight, andYahel, three. Also released wereSharon Avigdori, 52, a drama therapist, and her daughterNoam, 12, who are relatives of Dr Haran and were kidnapped from Be'eri at the same time. Another child who was released yesterday isEmily Hand, who turned nine while in captivity. The Irish-Israeli girl had been held hostage without any of her family with her. Emily's father, Tom Hand, who was originally told Emily had been killed,told the BBCthat he was determined to keep doing everything he could to help bring the other hostages home. Most of the 39 Palestinians released by Israel on Friday - 24 women and 15 teenage boys - were in pre-trial detention. One of them,Sarah al-Suwaisa, said the Israelis had fired teargas and cut off the prisoners' electricity before the release. She called it ""humiliating, psychological torture"" and said ""only Hamas helped us"". A crowd gathered again in Beitunia on Saturday to receive more released Palestinians - women and teenagers who were held at Ofer prison. Many green Hamas flags were displayed there, the BBC's Lucy Williamson reports. Among those freed wasNourhan Awad, 23, who was arrested in 2015 on suspicion of being involved in a stabbing operation in Jerusalem. She served eight of the 10 years she was sentenced to. Israa Jaabishad also been in prison since 2015 after her car broke down on a highway 1.5km (0.9 miles) from a checkpoint in the West Bank. Israel said at the time that it was an attempted car bombing but this has been disputed. Meanwhile, Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said that the four Thai nationals released on Saturday were doing well. ""Everybody is safe, on the whole in good mental health and are able to speak normally,"" he wrote on social media.",2023-11-26T09:32:17.000Z

Gaza protest: Tens of thousands march in London calling for ceasefirePublished25 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators have marched through central London calling for a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. It was the first London march since Armistice Day,when more than 100 counter-protesters were arrested. Police said 15 people had been arrested at the march, though the ""overwhelming majority"" protested lawfully. The protest coincided with a four-day pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 14,500 people have been killed in Gaza - and more than a third of them children - since Israel began its retaliatory operation in response to Hamas's 7 October attacks. Hamas killed 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages during its unprecedented cross-border incursion. The Qatar-brokered truce between Israel and Hamas has so far led to the release of 26 Israeli hostages and 39 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. The march in central London came as a delay to the release of more Israeli hostages was resolved on the second day of the temporary truce. Organisers of the protest, which marched from Park Lane to Whitehall, estimated that some 300,000 people attended. The Metropolitan Police did not give a number. The force said the arrests included offences of inciting racial hatred, distributing material likely to stir up racial hatred, supporting a proscribed organisation, refusing directions to disperse, possessing an offensive weapon and assaulting an emergency worker. The Met has been under pressure for weeks over its handling of the now-regular demonstrations, with pressure from senior politicians for officers to come down harder on alleged displays of antisemitism. Some 1,500 officers were deployed to the protest and leaflets were given to protesters warning people about words or images that could break the law. The Met also said it was planning to position Arabic-speaking officers on the march, backed up in its central control room with lawyers to advise on whether specific phrases break the law. Protesters carrying Palestinian flags were seen with placards demanding a permanent ceasefire in the conflict, while some referenced the slogan ""from the river to the sea"". The language is interpreted by Israel and most Jewish groups as an expression of a desire to see Israel erased from the world, though pro-Palestinian activists contest this, saying it refers to ""the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice"". So far, the temporary truce is still holding and follows weeks of fighting and Israeli bombardments of Gaza, with the conflict sparked by Hamas's unprecedented cross-border attack in southern Israel that saw 1,200 people killed. Speaking at London's march, a pro-Palestinian protester played down the long-term significance of the temporary ceasefire. Shaun, 33, from north London, said: ""I don't know what's going to come from it, I don't know if it's positive, but I know full well that once this truce and temporary ceasefire are done they (Israel) are going to continue bombing and we're going to be right back where we were, so I'm not holding my breath."" Marches were also held in Glasgow and Cardiff. Asked about the Met's leaflets, march organiser Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said police had been placed under ""considerable pressure"" by politicians to be more aggressive in their policing of the demonstration. ""The leaflets reassert what everybody knows, which is that there are laws against hate speech, there are laws for showing support for proscribed hate organisations - so I'm not sure what the leaflets add,"" he said. Separately, a different protest was held by the Islamist group Hizb-ut-Tahrir outside the Egyptian embassy. The Met said two people at that march were arrested for racially-aggravated public order offences. It was the first by the group since 21 October, when video emerged showing a man chanting ""jihad"", prompting an outcry from politicians. The Met found no offences were identified from the clip.",2023-11-25T21:00:47.000Z

St Andrews University rector urged to apologise over Israel 'genocide' claimPublished25 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The newly-elected rector of St Andrews University is facing calls to apologise over an email accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Stella Maris said Palestinians had suffered ""apartheid, siege, illegal occupation and collective punishment"" during the Israel-Gaza war. Hundreds of students have demanded that she retract her remarks or resign just a month after taking up the role. St Andrews University said it was ""dismayed"" by the rector's comments. The row came as hundreds of people attended demonstrations in Scotland on Saturday calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. In Glasgow, people gathered at the Buchanan Street steps on Saturday holding signs and banners which said ""ceasefire now"". First Minister Humza Yousaf and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar took part in the Scottish Trades Union Congress's (STUC) annual St Andrew's Day protest which saw marchers gather at Glasgow Green. Asked about the St Andrews rector's comments he said: ""There are communities - Jewish communities, Muslim communities - who are feeling vulnerable and all of us have a responsibility to make sure we are simmering down any of those tensions as opposed to inflaming them. ""We can do that while very passionately arguing that what's happening in Gaza is unacceptable."" In a message to students sent on Tuesday, Ms Maris described how a vigil at the university was held earlier this month ""following weeks of genocidal attacks by the Israeli government against Gaza"". She said: ""We must continue to recognize and condemn acts that are internationally regarded as humanitarian and war crimes. ""It is also crucial to acknowledge and denounce the actions by Hamas that qualify as war crimes, notably the taking of hostages and deliberately targeting civilians, which I have and continue to do."" The email also included a link to a website which carried a story headlined: ""The evidence Israel killed its own citizens on Oct 7."" The role of rector, elected by students, is to provide pastoral support and represent the student community at the university's governing body where the rector serves as president. Ms Maris has rejected accusations that the message to students was antisemitic and argued her use of the terms genocide and apartheid were ""supported by numerous human rights organizations"". She told BBC Scotland News she would not be resigning and insisted she had done the right thing. Ms Maris sad: ""I have received a lot of backlash and it's quite disappointing. ""I really tried to write a statement that would make everyone happy, but realised I wasn't being true to my beliefs. ""I'm glad I did it and it was the right thing to do."" The rector added: ""I've had racist comments as a result and have been accused of antisemitism, which I reject. ""I don't intend on retracting my statement or resigning. ""I denounce antisemitism in the strongest form. Reject the weaponising of antisemitism."" However, a large group of students at the university, which was founded in 1413 and is one of the oldest in the UK, insisted Ms Maris's comments ""will only bring division and hatred"". They are now calling for her to apologise or step down. In a letter to the rector, they say: ""We are concerned that your letter does not demonstrate equal care for Palestinian and Israeli lives. ""What is truly unacceptable is that you do not care to mention, let alone demonstrate regard for, the two St Andrews students who were recently attacked because of their religion. ""Moreover, your letter does not show any appreciation for how your inflammatory and unfounded accusations of 'genocide,' 'apartheid,' and 'occupation' concerning the Jewish State will further embolden attacks and hatred against the Jewish students whom you were elected to care for. ""It is unacceptable for the rector to be selective in their responsibility to represent all students."" Ms Maris is a former English and philosophy graduate at the university and has since filled a series of student representation roles. She was elected rector on 10 October. Responding to Ms Maris's remarks, St Andrews University principal and vice-chancellor, Prof Dame Sally Mapstone, said the university was committed to free speech but that there was ""no place for antisemitism, Islamophobia, or racism of any kind"". She added: ""We are utterly dismayed that the rector, on this occasion, put her right to freedom of expression ahead of her duty to represent all students, and to be concerned for their welfare. ""We know that while some may have welcomed the message, others have been deeply offended and concerned by it. ""While every one of us shares a desire for peace and an end to hostilities in Israel and Gaza, we regret that her message, the language it used, and some of the sources it cited have caused alarm, division, and harm in our community, and more widely."" The temporary truce is still holding and follows weeks of fighting and Israeli bombardments of Gaza, with the conflict sparked by Hamas's unprecedented cross-border attack in southern Israel that saw 1,200 people killed. Hamas earlier announced a delay in the release of further Israeli hostages, claiming Israel had broken the terms of the truce deal over aid deliveries to northern Gaza. Israel denied this, and the releases were due to resume following mediation. On the first day of the four-day ceasefire on Friday, Hamas released 24 of the about 240 hostages taken during its attack on Israel and Israel freed 39 Palestinians from prison. The Israeli offensive has killed more than 14,500 Palestinians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza government.",2023-11-25T19:14:29.000Z

Gaza truce: Palestinians search for loved ones and check damaged homesPublished25 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"People have been waiting in long queues for fuel and aid in the Gaza Strip, as the four-day truce between Israel and Hamas appears to hold for a second day. Gazans are trying to make the most of the pause in fighting to gather much-needed supplies, search for loved ones and even take a walk by the sea. Some have visited their homes - or what is left of them - to see damage and recover what they can find. The truce has also seen more supplies allowed into the Palestinian territory. Israel imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip as it launched its retaliatory operation aimed at eliminating Hamas, following its 7 October attack in which militants killed at least 1,200 people in southern Israel and took more than 240 hostages. Since then, more than 14,500 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The four-day truce, mediated by Qatar, is meant to result in the release of 50 hostages and 150 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israeli jails. On the first day of the truce on Friday, around 150 trucks carried supplies into the Gaza Strip from Egypt. While it was the biggest amount of aid to enter Gaza since the first convoy crossed the border on 21 October, the UN says more is still needed. Communications are largely down across Gaza, however pictures emerging from the Strip show long queues for fuel and other supplies in Rafah, in the south of the territory. Trucks have been waiting on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing early on Saturday morning, ready to carry in food, water, fuel and medical supplies. The Israeli military confirmed that four tankers containing fuel and another four carrying cooking gas entered Gaza on Saturday morning. It is a slow process to get over the border with every vehicle checked by the Israeli military before making the crossing. The Palestinian Red Crescent said 61 aid trucks carrying food supplies, drinking water and medicines had set off from Rafah towards the north of Gaza. It said this would be the largest aid convoy to reach the north since the beginning of the fighting. The Israeli government said it was expecting 226 aid trucks to enter through the Nitzana crossing in southern Israel. ""This will include 113 trucks containing food, seven containing medical supplies, 27 containing water, 43 containing various supplies for shelter, 25 trucks containing hygiene supplies,"" spokesman Eytan Schwartz said. An additional 11 Egyptian trucks are carrying medical supplies to the Emirati hospital, he said. Despite joy for many at the cessation of fighting, it has been mixed with sadness after many returned to their destroyed homes to save what remained and retrieve the bodies of their loved ones from under the rubble. Tahani al-Najjar used the calm of the truce to return to the ruins of her Khan Younis home on Saturday, Reuters news agency reported. The 58-year-old pulled several intact cups from the rubble of her home, which she said had been destroyed by an Israeli air strike which also killed seven members of her family. In the southern city some people are living in makeshift tents outside the Nasser Hospital as they wait to decide whether to return to the north of the Strip. Crates of tomatoes, lemons, aubergines, peppers, onions and oranges could be seen at a street market in the city. Juliette Touma, spokesperson for the UN Relief and Works Agency, Unrwa, told the BBC the situation on the ground was ""absolutely terrible"" and, while the aid which had reached Gaza was welcome, the organisation was ready to receive much more. She said there was a need for basic hygiene items as well as more medical equipment, fuel and food. People have described having to flee with only the clothes on their backs and most have been unable to wash properly. Many public shelters are extremely overcrowded, Unrwa said, with its schools and other facilities housing more than a million displaced people.",2023-11-25T15:27:18.000Z

Israel's Palestinian prisoner release a 'window of hope' in West BankPublished25 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"By nightfall, the road in front of the Beitunia checkpoint had the feel of a restive festival, the sting of politics and tear gas mingling in the air. Small campfires flickered in front of a handful of green Hamas flags; there were many more Palestinian ones. The return of39 Palestinians from Israeli prisons to their homes in the occupied West Bankwas never just going to be a family affair. Israel's jailing of large numbers of people on security grounds is widely seen by Palestinians as a tool of the occupation. Charges range from murder and violent attacks on Israelis to stone-throwing. Many Palestinians say Israel is criminalising acts of resistance by an occupied people - the Israeli Prison Service (IPS) told the BBC all prisoners are detained ""according to and under the provisions of the law"". A quarter of the population of the West Bank has spent time in an Israeli jail; it is a shared experience. And more than 3,000 people have been arrested since the 7 October attacks - including almost 900 children - according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club president, Abdallah Zughary. Many of these detainees have been placed in administrative detention without charge, he says. ""Most of them are civilians, not affiliated with any kind of political party or militant group,"" Mr Zughary told me. ""Since 7 October, there have been no visits by families or lawyers to prisoners. And six prisoners have died."" He accuses Israel of using the justice system as a ""revenge policy"". A spokesperson for the IPS told the BBC that over the past few weeks, ""four national security prisoners died"" in different circumstances and on different days. ""We have no knowledge of the causes of death,"" they added.They refused to comment on the suggestion that families and lawyers had not been allowed to visit prisoners. There is little faith here in Israel's military courts, which are responsible for policing an occupied population, and which human rights groups have accused of handing down guilty verdicts to Palestinians 99% of the time. The release of 39 women and teenagers is a tiny drop in the ocean of prisoners, but a massive symbol for Palestinians of their ability to - occasionally - force Israel's hand. Mustafa Barghouti, a senior Palestinian politician, told me that prisoners were a key part of the deal agreed between Israel and Hamas, and a key part of why that deal was good for Palestinians. It should also be taken as a sign, he said, that a permanent ceasefire was possible, despite Israel's insistence on resuming the war after the hostage deal has run its course. ""Israel has said many things before,"" Dr Barghouti told me. ""They said they would kill Hamas. Now they are negotiating with them."" Israel has said its goals of eliminating Hamas and getting the hostages back are not in conflict, but some in its army worry that the deal could allow their enemy to regroup. It has also strengthened the political standing of Hamas here in the West Bank - many of those gathered to wait for the returning prisoners at Beitunia checkpoint credited the group, though others stressed that this moment belonged to all Palestinians. ""We would like that this happened without the hostages taken by Hamas,"" human rights lawyer Mohammed Khatib said.  ""But Israel doesn't want [to do] this without paying the price. Without the Hamas hostages, Israel would not allow these people out."" But, he said, it was also a ""window of hope"" for both Palestinians and Israelis. ""The end [goal] is that they must accept us as people, they must accept our right to exist. ""We are humans: we have names, families, lives. I see all of this in the eye of a child released from prison today."" The return of prisoners here has been paved by a brutal attack, a devastating war and a hostage crisis. ""There's a joy in this release but it is incomplete joy,"" Abdallah Zughary told me, ""because there's a big price Palestinians have paid over past 45 days."" Eman Barghouti, welcoming home her sister-in-law Hanan today, told me her family would not celebrate the release publicly, out of respect for Palestinians killed, injured and displaced by Israel's bombardment of Gaza. She said all the families she knew were doing the same. But the crowds swarming around the prisoners' bus as it crossed into Beitunia had no such reserve; a moment of happiness for prisoners' families is also a moment of victory for Palestinians across the West Bank. Behind the darkened windows, some of the prisoners could be seen dancing - one wrapped in a Palestinian flag. To Israel the prisoners it released today are a security threat. To the Palestinians gathered to greet them, they are victims of Israel's occupation - and their release is symbolic of a wider goal.",2023-11-25T15:00:50.000Z

Israel-Gaza: Families' relief as hostages releasedPublished25 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Families of 13 Israeli hostages released by Hamas have spoken of their relief at their return. The group, which includes young children and elderly women, are now back in Israel after being brought by the Red Cross from Gaza into Egypt. Soon after,39 Palestinian detainees were released across the Beitunia checkpoint in the West Bank. Ten Thai nationals and one Filipino were also released by Hamas, in a deal separate to the one mediated by Qatar. Under the terms of the Qatar deal, a total of 50 Israeli hostages and 150 Palestinian detainees are meant to be released over four days during a temporary pause in the fighting. The hostages released by Hamas on Friday were taken to an Egyptian hospital for medical assessments before being taken back to Israel. The Israelis include four children - aged two, four, six and nine - as well as an 85-year-old woman. ""We have now completed the return of the first of our hostages. Children, their mothers and other women. Each and every one of them is a entire world,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. ""But I emphasise to you - the families, and to you - the citizens of Israel: We are committed to the return of all our hostages."" Yoni Asher's wife, Doron Katz Asher, 34, and their two daughters Raz, four, and Aviv, two, have been released. ""I am determined to bring about the resurrection of my family from the trauma and the terrible bereavement we went through,"" Mr Asher told the BBC. ""I don't celebrate, I won't celebrate until the last of the kidnapped returns,"" he said. ""The families of the kidnapped are not posters, they are not slogans, they are real people, and the families of the kidnapped are from today my new family, and I will make sure and do everything that the last of the kidnapped comes home."" Margalit Moses, 78, was also among those released by Hamas. A cancer survivor, she was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on 7 October. Daniele Aloni and her six-year-old daughter Emilia have also been released as part of the deal. They were kidnapped on 7 October during a visit to stay with family in Kibbutz Nir Oz. During the attacks, the last message Daniele sent to her family said that ""there were terrorists in their house"" and she was afraid that they would not survive. Itay Ravi, whose 78-year-old uncle Avraham remains in captivity, says ""this is one step towards being happy"" after three of his family members were released. His aunt, Ruthi Munder, 78, his cousin Keren Munder, 54, and her son, Ohad Munder-Zichri, nine, were kidnapped from Nir Oz. ""They're making their way now to Israeli hospitals, to family, and this is very exciting. However, we cannot be completely happy,"" he told BBC Newsnight. ""It's still a very, very horrific reality that we're in,"" Mr Ravi added. Ohad turned nine while being held in Gaza. ""The only celebration that we're going to have soon is [for] Ohad's ninth birthday,"" Mr Ravi said. ""Now we're going to have a big celebration for him, with all the friends and family, after he gets into the new reality. We'll see how he's back…I don't know how a nine-year-old comes back after 50 days in the hands of a terrorist organisation. I hope he does well."" There was also huge relief among families of the Thai nationals and Filipino released by Hamas. Kittiya Thuengsaeng, the girlfriend of 28-year-old Thai hostage Wichai Kalapat,described the emotional rollercoaster she went through since he disappeared. She was told by local Thai officials that her boyfriend of three years had died in the 7 October attacks. But when Thai authorities announced all of the names of the deceased, Wichai's name was not on there. Five days ago, she was told he was on the list of Thai hostages. Urai Chantachart confirmed her brother Boonthom Pankhong, 39, and his girlfriend Natthawaree Mulakan were among the Thai hostages released by Hamas on Friday. Urai told BBC Thai that the family was ""overjoyed"" and that they had never lost faith that Boonthom was still alive. Looking at a photo released by the foreign affairs ministry, she said she thought her brother looked ""better than expected"", although he seemed to have lost weight. He and his girlfriend are now receiving receiving treatment at Shamir Medical Center in Israel, she added. Gelienor (Jimmy) Pacheco, 33, from the Philippines, was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7. Jimmy was a carer for fellow kibbutz resident Amitai Ben Zvi who was killed in the Hamas raid. The releases of Wichai, Jimmy, Boonthom and Natthawaree were confirmed on Saturday morning. A total of 39 Palestinian detainees have been released from Israeli prisons as part of the exchange. They are accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to attempted murder. Some had been convicted of crimes while others were awaiting trial. The group of 24 women and 15 teenage boys was released across the Beituniya checkpoint in the occupied West Bank and greeted by large crowds chanting. One Palestinian detainee released was Marah Bakeer. She was arrested in 2015, when she was 16 years old, and sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in jail for a knife attack on a border police officer. Bakeer told waiting journalists: ""This deal comes following the death of many people and this makes us unhappy and uncomfortable."" She said she was kept in solitary confinement and had ""no idea what was happening outside, no idea about the situation in Gaza"". ""The news of the deal was a surprise,"" she said. The detainees were chosen from a list of 300 women and minors compiled by Israel. Less than a quarter of those on the list have been convicted - the vast majority are being held on remand while awaiting trial. Most of those listed are teenage boys - 40% of them under the age of 18. There is also one teenage girl and 32 women. Hamas took more than 200 hostages during a cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed. Human rights organisations say the number of Palestinians held without charge in Israeli jails has shot up since the 7 October attacks. At least 60 aid lorries have entered Gaza since the pause in fighting - Israel says eight of the lorries are bringing in fuel, part of 130,000 litres to be delivered each day of the truce. Although the four-day ceasefire agreement suggests all areas should be accessible to aid agencies, Israel has told Palestinians now displaced in the south not to try to return home, saying the north is a war zone - although many thousands of civilians are believed to remain there.

Thai hostages: Relief for woman who feared boyfriend died in Hamas attackPublished25 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A woman who believed her boyfriend was killed in the 7 October attack on Israel has spoken of her joy at realising they would soon be reunited. Kittiya Thuengsaeng told the BBC she recognised Wichai Kalapat in TV images of the 10 Thai hostages released from Gaza on Friday. It was feared Wichai was among Thai citizens killed in the Hamas raid. She said confirmation her boyfriend was among the foreign nationals being held only came five days ago. Two days after the 7 October attack, Kittiya was given the devastating news her boyfriend of three years was believed to be among a group of at least 30 Thai nationals killed. She posted messages on social media mourning the man she planned to marry next year when he returned from Israel, where he had travelled for work. However, when an official list of the dead was published, Wichai's name was not on it. After an agonising wait for information, Kittiya discovered last week that he was among 32 Thai citizens being held hostage inside Gaza. Speaking to the BBC after seeing him alive in a car carrying hostages from the border to an Israeli hospital, she said: ""I'm so happy because I feared he wouldn't be among those released. ""I want him to heal from any mental condition he may have first, then he can return to Thailand. ""Right now, I can wait for him. I've been waiting for so long, I can wait a little longer."" Thai nationals were disproportionately impacted as around 30,000 have travelled to Israel for work, primarily in the agriculture sector. Among them were Thai nationals Boonthom Pankhong, 39, and his girlfriend, Natthawaree Mulakan, who were also released by Hamas on Friday. Boonthom's family told BBC Thai that he had been working in Israel for five years when he was kidnapped, and that he was the family's main breadwinner, sending money home to Thailand regularly. His sister Urai Chantachart told BBC Thai the family were told about the release by Boonthom's nephew, who still works on a farm in Israel, and that they were ""overjoyed"". ""Our family has been suffering for over a month, but we never thought he was dead. We strongly believed that he [was] still alive,"" she said. Looking at a photo released by the foreign affairs ministry, she said she thought her brother looked ""better than expected"", although he seemed to have lost weight. Urai was not sure whether he and his girlfriend would return home or stay in Israel. They are both receiving treatment at Shamir Medical Center in Israel, she added. Other families are nervously awaiting news to find out if their loved one is among those whose release was secured on Friday. Thongkoon Onkaew, the mother of Natthaporn Onkaew, a 26-year-old Thai farmer, said the last time she spoke to her son was on the morning of 7 October, when he was planning to play football with friends. She said: ""I wish my son is one of the first being released. It has been a painful month with no good news. ""I wish my son and other Thai hostages are safe, I thank all the authorities for the effort negotiating the release of Thai nationals."" Wanida Maarsa, the wife of Anucha Angkaew, 28, said: ""I need to call the local representative to check the news. I am now bombarded with messages. ""If my husband is one of them, I would be so happy."" Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin initially said 12 people were released, but an official from the Qatari government - which has mediated between Israel and Hamas - later said the number was 10. The release of Thai nationals is separate to an agreement which is expected see 50 Israeli hostages freed from Gaza during a temporary four-day pause in fighting. Thirteen Israeli citizens - all women and children - and a Filipino national were among the first group of hostages to be freed. Israel has released 39 Palestinian detainees as part of the agreement. Thailand's foreign ministry said its freed citizens would be placed under medical supervision without access to relatives for 48 hours after being transferred to an Israeli hospital. A statement issued by the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it sent its heartfelt congratulations to the released Thai nationals and their families, and would do all possible to get them home to Thailand quickly.

"Gaza hostages: 'My father wasn’t released, but I’m happy for those families'Published25 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Maayan Kaplun Keidar believes her father, Dror Kaplun, is one of those held hostage by Hamas on the Gaza Strip since 7 October - although she does not know for sure. She did not expect him to be among those released in Friday's Israel-Hamas deal, but hopes the agreement paves the way for him, and all those being held hostage, to be freed at a later date. Dror lived with his wife on kibbutz Be'eri, a few kilometres from the border with Gaza, and one of the communities worst hit in the Hamas attacks. For the first few hours, Ms Kaplun Keidar said he was sending ""horrifying"" messages on the family Whatsapp group - including that Hamas fighters had entered the community and started burning houses - but communications eventually went quiet. ""I was praying there was a network problem,"" she told BBC News. She has not heard from him since, but shortly after the attacks she saw a video online of him being marched through the streets by Hamas gunmen. Dror's wife, Marcelle Frailich Kaplun, can also been seen in the video, as can their neighbours, Ms Kaplun Keidar said. A few days later she received news that Marcelle's body had been found, as had those of the neighbours - she has received no such news about her father's body, leading her to believe he was taken back to Gaza. ""Even if there's a 5% chance he's alive, I need to fight for him,"" she said. On Friday, Hamas released 24 hostages - including 13 Israelis - in a deal brokered by Qatar, the largest round of releases since the attacks. Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, described the release as ""bittersweet"", because most hostages were still in Gaza. Under the terms of the deal, 50 Israeli hostages - as well as 150 Palestinian detainees, 39 of which were released on Friday - are meant to be freed over four days during a temporary pause in fighting in the Gaza Strip. It had previously been reported that only women and children would be released, and Ms Kaplun Keidar was not expecting her father to be among the group - but she was watching developments closely. Speaking to the BBC shortly before the release was confirmed, she said she wanted to see it happen before celebrating - ""you never know what might happen,"" she said. ""But I'm very happy they are supposed to be released. I'm very happy for those families that will meet their loved ones, even if I'm not one of them,"" she said. Ms Kaplun Keidar added that she hoped this deal would mean more hostages would be released in the future. ""Hopefully this will be the start of the release of everyone,"" she said, although she acknowledged that ""anything could happen"". Sharone Lifschitz is in a similar position. Her 83-year-old father, Oded, is missing, presumed to be held captive. Her mother Yocheved, 85, wasone of only four peoplereleased by Hamas before Friday. An Israeli soldier was also freed in ground operations. Ms Lifschitz said dozens of people from her community, Nir Oz, were taken hostage. ""So you can understand that these people we lived with all our lives,"" she told the BBC before the release was confirmed. ""We know them, so there's a huge amount of anticipation."" ""But each person that will come back is a great joy, and obviously we also fear that our loved ones will not be on this list [of those released],"" she said. Ms Lifschitz's father was also not expected to be released on Friday, and she said he would ""fighting to be at the back of the queue"". ""He will be saying, 'No you go first'."" While she said that each person released is a ""ray of light"", and that she was looking forward to seeing them, she added that the damage caused by the 7 October attacks is ongoing. She said that some of those released will be informed for the first time that their relatives or friends were killed. ""The trauma is not going to end - this is a long and horrendous story,"" she said.",2023-11-25T00:54:06.000Z

"When this truce ends, the decisive next phase of war beginsPublished25 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Israel's military campaign in Gaza City is probably in its final stages. The truce, brokered to allow for the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, will delay the IDF by anywhere from four to nine days, depending on how many hostages Hamas decides to release. When that ends, Israeli experts expect the battle for control of Gaza City to resume and last another week to 10 days. But what happens when the Israeli military turns its attention to the southern Gaza Strip, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly indicated? Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas wherever it exists. It assumes that the group's most important leaders, Yayha Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, are somewhere in the south, along with thousands of fighters and, probably, a significant number of Israeli hostages. If Israel decides to do to the south what it's already done to the north, will Western - especially American - goodwill start to run out? With the bulk of the Gaza Strip's estimated 2.2 million people now crammed into the southern two thirds of the Strip, many of them homeless and traumatised, is a larger humanitarian disaster looming? One of the last straws might be the sight of hundreds of Palestinian civilians, huddled in tents, amid the sandy fields of a place called al-Mawasi. According to the UN relief agency for Palestinians (Unrwa), almost 1.7 million people have been displaced across the Gaza Strip since 7 October. Most of them are in the south, living in overcrowded shelters. UN officials speak of already desperate conditions, with tens of thousands of people sheltering in schools, hospitals and, in some cases, tents. Early winter rains have already caused flooding, adding to the misery. For several weeks, Israeli officials have been talking about a solution - a so-called ""safe area"" at al-Mawasi, a thin strip of mainly agricultural land along the Mediterranean coast, close to the Egyptian border. Last week, leaflets dropped over the nearby city of Khan Yunis warned of impending airstrikes and told people to move west, towards the sea. In a post on social media on Thursday, Avichay Adraee, the IDF's spokesman for the Arabic media, told Gazans al-Mawasi would provide ""the appropriate conditions to protect your loved ones."" But how realistic is it to expect more than two million people to shelter there while the war rages nearby? And just how ""appropriate"" are conditions at al-Mawasi? The map shows a patchwork of fields, greenhouses and scattered houses. Although it is hard to be certain, the area defined by Israel is about 2.5km (1.6 miles) wide, at its widest, and just over 4km (2.5 miles) long. Dr Michael Milshtein, a former adviser on Palestinian affairs to Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), calls it ""a beautiful and fruitful place, but quite small"". Aid agencies take a less generous view. ""It's a tiny piece of land,"" Juliette Touma, director of communications for Unrwa, says. ""There's nothing there. It's just sand dunes and palm trees."" Any attempt to accommodate hundreds of thousands of displaced people, in an area seemingly lacking in essential infrastructure - there are no hospitals - will present the UN with a mammoth humanitarian challenge, including the setting up of emergency shelter, most likely tents. It is also a moral challenge with deep historical resonance - much of Gaza's population is descended from refugees who lived in tents after their expulsion from Israel in 1948. The Gaza Strip is already home to eight refugee camps, which have evolved over the decades into bustling, overcrowded towns. The UN doesn't want to be responsible for setting up yet another camp. Israeli officials say it will be up to aid agencies to make sure help reaches al-Mawasi from the Rafah crossing, more than 10km away. They haven't said how this will work in practice. US officials are said to be trying to negotiate with Israel over additional safe areas, possibly including one at Dahaniya, at the far southern tip of the Gaza Strip. Under the terms of the hostage release agreement, which came into effect on Friday, Israel should also allow 200 trucks of aid into Gaza each day, much more than in recent weeks. But on 16 November, a statement by the heads of 18 UN agencies and NGOs involved in providing assistance to Palestinian civilians appeared to reject Israel's plans outright. ""We will not participate in the establishment of any 'safe zone' in Gaza that is set up without the agreement of all the parties,"" it said. UN officials say the parties include Israel, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank. Without mentioning al-Mawasi by name, the 16 November statement warned that Israel's unilateral proposals could put many lives at risk. One of the signatories, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, called the plans ""a recipe for disaster"". ""Attempting to cram so many people into such a small area with such little infrastructure or services,"" he said, ""will significantly increase risks to health for people who are already on the brink."" Israeli officials say Hamas is to blame and seem unfazed by the dangers. Al-Mawasi, they say, is the one area Israeli forces have undertaken not to attack. ""It's going to be dire. But they'll live,"" says Lt Col Richard Hecht, an IDF spokesman. For Israel, it's a matter of military necessity. Just as Hamas was embedded in Gaza City, it says, so the group's fighters and infrastructure exist in Khan Yunis and Rafah. Removing the civilian population ahead of an assault, Israelis argue, is the humane way to approach the job of defeating Hamas. ""People in Israel don't like the situation where people in Gaza are somewhere in al-Mawasi, under the rain of winter, which is coming,"" says retired Maj Gen Yaacov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser. ""But what is the alternative? If someone has an idea how to destroy Hamas without it, please tell us."" The prospect of further months of suffering, compounded by extreme overcrowding and harsh winter conditions, is bound to add to mounting international disquiet over the conduct of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. ""Conducting a new major ground operation in that area risks casualties and displacement of civilians on a scale which will threaten to undermine international sympathy for Israel,"" a Western official told me, speaking on strict condition of anonymity. 'It's a question of how long Western patience will last."" The Netanyahu government knows that it can count on unprecedentedly deep reserves of Western goodwill, following the unspeakable horrors perpetrated by Hamas on 7 October. But Israeli officials also know those reserves are not endless and that international calls for restraint are likely to become louder when the hostage truce comes to an end and Israel resumes its military campaign. ""My hope is that international pressure after the truce is ended will not prevent that,"" says Dr Eyal Hulata, who led Israel's National Security Council from 2021 to 2023. ""My hope is that the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu will not cave to pressure with this. This is what the citizens of Israel expect of their leaders."" With winter looming, Israel gearing up for the decisive next phase of its campaign, and no agreement on how to deal with the civilian population, Gaza's long agony looks set to continue. Perhaps even to get worse.",2023-11-25T00:23:33.000Z

Israel releases 39 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisonsPublished24 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A total of 39 Palestinian detainees have been released from Israeli prisons in exchange for a group of hostages held by Hamas. The deal - mediated by Qatar - includes a four-day pause in the fighting. They are accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to attempted murder. Some were convicted while others were awaiting trial. The group of 24 women and 15 teenage boys was released across the Beituniya checkpoint in the occupied West Bank. They will then be allowed to return home, according to Israel's prison service. The detainees were chosen from a list of 300 women and minors compiled by Israel. Less than a quarter of those on the list have been convicted - the vast majority are being held on remand while awaiting trial. Most of those listed are teenage boys - 40% of them under the age of 18. There is also one teenage girl and 32 women. Earlier, the road by Beituniya checkpoint, near Ramallah, was sharp with the smell of tear gas. Groups of Palestinian men and boys faced the Israeli army lining up on the road ahead. The army fired rubber bullets and tear gas towards the crowd, to push them back. Some of the young people gathered threw stones and tear gas canisters back towards the troops. ""It's a sign of hope for Palestinians and Israelis that the ceasefire will continue and the killing will stop,"" Mohammed Khatib, who was in the crowd, told the BBC. Upon the prisoners' release, the bus that transported them inched its way through a sea of jubilant Palestinian supporters. Through the windows, some of the prisoners could be seen dancing, one wrapped in a Palestinian flag. Outside, mobile phones were raised to the glass amid ululations and shouts of welcome and ""God is great"". A few in the crowd waved Hamas flags, but others spoke of Palestinian unity, a small moment of victory in the midst of a gruelling war. For Israel, the released prisoners are a security threat; for the Palestinians gathered here to greet them, they are victims of Israel's occupation - and their release is a symbol. Thirteen Israeli hostages were released by Hamas under the truce deal. It was confirmed on Friday that they had arrived back in Israel. The Thai prime minister says that a group of Thai nationals held hostage by Hamas in Gaza were also released - separate from the Qatar-mediated truce deal. Israel and Hamas reached a deal earlier this week to release 50 of the hostages held in Gaza during four-day pause in fighting. The agreement should see a total of 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails released and a significant increase in humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza. Some 60 lorries carrying medical supplies, fuel and food entered from Egypt on Friday. Hamas took more than 200 hostages during a cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed. Human rights organisations say the number of Palestinians held without charge in Israeli jails has shot up since the 7 October attacks. There are now thought to be more than 6,000 Palestinians held by Israel on security grounds - many still awaiting trial. Almost every Palestinian family in the West Bank is thought to have had a relative detained by Israel at some point in the past - often in jails inside Israel, making it difficult or impossible for their relatives to visit.",2023-11-24T19:32:44.000Z

Gaza protest: Met Police leaflet warns against language that breaks lawPublished24 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Met Police are to clarify what type of language might break the law when chanted or displayed at pro-Palestinian marches. The force will hand out leaflets at Saturday's march in central London warning against using words or images ""likely to land you in jail"". It is the first time the Met has tried to give clarity on what language is unacceptable. Organisers say at least 100,000 people could turn out for the protest. The Met haspreviously been criticisedover its handling of the pro-Palestinian protests - which have been held weekly since 14 October  - with ministers calling for the force to take a tougher line on those deemed to be expressing extremist views. The force is also planning to position Arabic-speaking officers on the march, backed up in its central control room with lawyers to advise on whether specific phrases break the law. Some 1,500 officers will be on the streets on Saturday with instructions to protect war memorials following criticism that police have not stopped protesters climbing on them. The leaflets warn protesters not to use words or images: Protesters will be told to ""bin any placard or sign that might break these rules"". The leaflets also warn against damaging statues, using threatening words or behaviour and fireworks, which have been a problem on Pro-Palestinian protests to date. In a briefing to reporters, the Met's Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan stressed the force's new approach of directly telling protesters about the limits to what they can say or write on placards. ""We will not tolerate anyone who celebrates acts of terrorism such as the killing or kidnap of innocent people,"" he said. He said police would act ""decisively and quickly"" and ""intervene immediately"" if there were chants of ""jihad"", though he also said context was important. Damage to poppy wreaths would not be tolerated, and police will specifically protect the Royal Artillery Memorial at Hyde Park Corner after criticism that protesters who climbed on it last week were not arrested. Mr Adelekan said there were potential offences of criminal damage and disorderly behaviour for people who climbed statues but the power of arrest lay with individual officers. The Met is also under pressure to stop breakaway protests, especially attempts to sit in at railway stations after the main protests have finished. Last week, a sit-in protest was held at London's Waterloo station. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been held each week in London and other parts of the UK since 14 October, a week after Hamas's unprecedented cross-border attacks in Israel killed 1,200 people and saw about 240 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 14,000 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory campaign, and the UN has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory. Meanwhile, the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir has given the police notice of a separate protest at the Egyptian embassy. Hizb ut-Tahrir's status has been a subject of political controversy for decades. Former prime ministers Tony Blair and David Cameron both promised to ban the group, whose stated aim is the re-establishment of an Islamic caliphate, before abandoning the proposals, Mr Adelekan said the Hizb ut-Tahrir protest would be subject to strict requirements that it should begin at 13:00 GMT and disperse at 15:30. He dismissed suggestions from Jewish people that it was not safe to enter central London during pro-Palestinian protests, saying that the 1,500 officers were being deployed to ensure safety. On Sunday the first major march against antisemitism will take place with 45,000 expected by the organisers, the Campaign Against Antisemitism. The Met has intelligence that right-wing activist Tommy Robinson is due to attend as a ""reporter"". Protest organisers have made clear he is not welcome. ""Mutual aid"" officers from other police forces will again support operations in London this weekend. ""Our officers just need a break"", Mr Adelekan said. Correction: A previous version incorrectly identified the location of a potential protest. Police have been notified of a protest at the Egyptian embassy.",2023-11-24T15:47:04.000Z

David Cameron warns Israel over Gaza civilian casualtiesPublished24 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Lord Cameron has warned Israel that it will never be secure unless there is ""long-term safety, security and stability"" for the Palestinian people. In his first full interview as foreign secretary, he welcomed Friday's pause in the fighting to get hostages out of Gaza and humanitarian aid in. But he told the BBC that civilian casualties in Gaza were too high. He also said that Israeli forces must abide by international humanitarian law. Lord Cameron urged Israel to crack down on what he called ""completely unacceptable"" violence by settlers in the occupied West Bank. It was important for Israel to realise, he said, that ""it must act in a way that delivers its long-term security"" and he said that would ultimately depend on ""Palestinians living in peace and stability and security in this land at the same time"". He also said that getting Arab countries involved in working for a future for the Palestinian people that gave them some kind of security was ""a very big part of the picture"". Lord Cameron was speaking on the day he visited Ramallah in the West Bank where he met Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority and other senior Palestinian leaders. He announced the UK would give a further £30m in humanitarian aid to the United Nations and other agencies on the ground in Gaza, mainly shelters, blanket, food and medicine. He said Israel had a right to self-defence and what happened on 7 October was ""completely appalling"", but he added: ""When I met the Israeli president, prime minister and others, I stressed over and over again that they must abide by international humanitarian law, that the number of casualties are too high and they have to have that at the top of their minds."" He said he would have a ""continuous dialogue"" with Israel about this and also the rising settler violence in the West Bank. ""People are actually targeting and on occasion killing Palestinian civilians, it's completely unacceptable and those people responsible for that, it's not good enough just to arrest them, they need to be arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned. These are crimes."" Lord Cameron said he had come to Israel to talk to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders about the future. ""There won't be long term safety and security and stability for Israel, unless there is long term safety, security and stability for the Palestinian people,"" he said. ""And you have to start thinking about the future…you've got to paint a picture of Palestinians living in peace and stability."" He added: ""You've got to think about what will happen in Gaza after this conflict has finished and how is that going to be stabilised? How is that going to be secure? How's it going to be governed. ""And then you've got to think about how you start to build the capacity for there to be a state in which Palestinians can live in stability and security, that, of course, that's difficult. But you have to try.""",2023-11-24T15:36:19.000Z

Clemence Mtenga tributes: Tanzanian student killed in Israel was a 'leader'Published24 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Clemence Mtenga should have graduated from university this week, instead his body is being flown home from Israel to his grieving family in Tanzania. It remains unclear how he died but the 22-year-old agriculture student was killed following the 7 October attacks when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip. His body is being repatriated to Dar es Salaam on Friday and then taken to his hometown in Rombo district near Kilimanjaro for the funeral. His family told BBC News he would finally be laid to rest in a ceremony on Tuesday attended by family and friends. Mr Mtenga had travelled to Israel as part of a study programme, arriving just one month before the attack. This week he was awarded his degree from the Sokoine University of Agriculture in Tanzania. One of his classmates attending the graduation ceremony, Cleopatra Mluge, told the BBC that Mr Mtenga ""was like a leader because he was humble and always ready to assist and advise friends"". Another classmate, Irene Chaboma, remembered him as ""a hard worker in class and one of the best performing students. May his soul rest in peace."" It is estimated that around 1,200 people were killed during the Hamas attack with gunmen taking about 240 hostages, among them several people from overseas. Israel initially said that Mr Mtenga and fellow Tanzanian Joshua Loitu Mollel were among those hostages. However, Mr Mtenga is not one of the two hostages whose bodies have been recovered from Gaza, so it remains unclear where and how he died. Israel has responded to the Hamas attacks with repeated air strikes on Gaza and launched a ground offensive. At least 13,300 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The two sides have since agreeda four day pause in fighting. The two Tanzanians were living in Israel as part of an agricultural internship programme. They were expected to stay in the country for a further 11 months. Approximately 260 Tanzanians study agriculture in Israel. Revocatus Kimario, the head of Sugeco, which ran the university's internship programme said: ""For us, Clemence is a hero because he went abroad to look for skills to transform and develop agriculture in his own country. We pray for his family."" Fellow student on the internship programme, Ezekiel Kitiku, has chosen to remain in Israel. He told the BBC that Mr Mtenga had been living at Kibbutz Nir Oz and had been due to work at a local dairy farm in the afternoon when it was attacked by Hamas gunmen. Mr Kitiku paid tribute to his friend, remembering him as a fitness enthusiast. ""My friend was the one who liked to work out, so it was our daily routine in the evening to work out together,"" he told the BBC. ""We would go to the gym and we go on the bikes together. He was a very good friend to me."" ""We spent so much time together,"" he added. ""We cooked together and always spent our evenings together talking about our day. For him to leave suddenly is very painful."" The last time Mr Kitiku heard from Mr Mtenga was on the day of the attack before he lost mobile phone contact. He said his Christian faith is helping him, ""and I believe I will meet him again one day"". Additional reporting from Eagan Salla in Morogoro.",2023-11-24T12:45:39.000Z

"Allow more aid into Gaza, Lord Cameron urges Benjamin Netanyahu in IsraelPublished23 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has urged Israel to allow more aid into Gaza to show the Palestinian people and the world that the West wants to help. He also said all possible precautions should be taken to minimise civilian casualties. Lord Cameron had talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog. He arrived amid uncertainty about when a pause in the fighting in Gaza, agreed with Hamas, would take effect. Qatar said the truce, aimed at allowing some of the hostages held by Hamas and some Palestinians held in Israeli jails to be freed,would now begin on Friday morning. Humanitarian aid would start being delivered to Palestinian civilians in Gaza as soon as possible after the fighting stopped, a Qatari foreign ministry spokesman added. A four-day halt in the conflict had been due to come into force on Thursday morning, but was delayed. The foreign secretary, who made a surprise return to government last week, said he hoped it could be an ""opportunity to crucially get hostages out and get aid into Gaza"". Earlier, Lord Cameron visited Kibbutz Be'eri, the scene of one of the worst Hamas attacks on Israel which triggered the war on 7 October. Around 100 Israelis were killed, many of them women and children. He said: ""I wanted to come here to see it for myself; I have heard and seen things I will never forget."" As he met Mr Netanyahu in Jerusalem, he added: ""There is never any excuse for this sort of hostage-taking. ""All the hostages should be released, but I hope that everyone who is responsible and behind this agreement can make it happen, to bring relief to those families, including, of course, there are British nationals who have been taken hostage."" But as well as expressing support and solidarity, the foreign secretary also called on Israel to minimise civilian casualties and get more humanitarian aid into Gaza. ""It is vitally important that we demonstrate to the Palestinian people, to the world, that we want to help. Those people need food, they need water, they need medicine,"" he said. A defiant Mr Netanyahu pledged: ""We will continue with the goals of the war and to destroy Hamas, because Hamas has already promised that they will do the same thing again and again and again. ""There is no hope for peace between Israel and the Palestinians and between Israel and the Arab countries if we do not eradicate this murderous movement, which threatens the future of all of us,"" he told the foreign secretary. Until the pause comes into force, Israel has said it will continue to target Hamas. Under the deal agreed, 50 hostages seized by Hamas last month would be released, along with more than a hundred Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. Meeting Mr Herzog, Lord Cameron spoke of a ""huge amount of trauma in Israel because of the taking of 244 hostages"". He said he remembered ""the worst days of being prime minister was when British hostages were taken in Syria, and so many of them lost their lives in the most gruesome, terrible fashion"". He added: ""I remember the effect that had on me as prime minister and thinking about that, and so perhaps know a tiny bit of what your nation is going through."" On Wednesday, Lord Cameron met foreign ministers from Arab and Islamic countries - including the Palestinian Authority - at Lancaster House in London to discuss the crisis. Counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Nigeria were there, as well as the secretary general of the League of Arab States and the ambassador of Qatar. The foreign secretary said the group discussed how to use the planned pause in the fighting to consider ""how we can build a peaceful future which provides security for Israel but also peace and stability for the Palestinian people"". Amnesty International UK's chief executive Sacha Deshmukh said ""short pauses"" were ""not enough"", and Lord Cameron should back a full ceasefire ""in the interests of averting further civilian suffering for Palestinians and Israelis"". ""With the horrifying civilian death toll from Israeli attacks in Gaza still rising and no permanent ceasefire in sight, it's vital that David Cameron uses this trip to signal an urgently needed change of direction from the UK Government in support of humanity and international law,"" he added. The Hamas attacks in Israel last month killed some 1,200 people and saw about 240 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said more than 14,000 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory campaign.",2023-11-23T18:29:05.000Z

What we know about Israel-Hamas Gaza deal on hostagesPublished23 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel and Hamas have reached a deal to exchange 50 of the hostages held in Gaza for a four-day pause in fighting. The agreement should also see 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails released and a significant increase in humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza. Mediator Qatar has said the pause will start at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday and the first group of 13 hostages will be released at 16:00. The US president has said the deal will end the hostages' ""unspeakable ordeal"" and ""alleviate the suffering of innocent Palestinian families"". The Israeli government has vowed to complete its war to eliminate Hamas and return the rest of the more than 200 hostages who Hamas gunmen kidnapped during a cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed. Hamas - which Israel, the US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - has said the deal will give Palestinians time to recover after an intense Israeli air and ground assault which its government in Gaza has said has killed more than 14,500 people. Their names have not been published, but we do know that they will all be women and children. After Israel's coalition government signed off on this deal early on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that ""at least 50 hostages - women and children - will be released over four days, during which a pause in the fighting will be held"". It also offered Hamas an incentive to release more, saying: ""The release of every additional 10 hostages will result in one additional day in the pause."" That clause is important for the hostages' families, some of whom had previously told the BBC that they did not want to see a partial deal. The 50 hostages, expected to be released in four batches, will be Israeli nationals or dual nationals, rather than foreigners. A spokesman for Qatar's foreign ministry told reporters in Doha on Thursday afternoon that the first group of hostages to be released on Friday would comprise 13 children and women, some of them elderly. ""Hostages from the same family will be put together in the same batch,"" Majid al-Ansari noted. He also said a list of names for the first group had been handed to Israel's Mossad intelligence agency to facilitate the implementation of the deal. Mr Netanyahu's office later confirmed that officials were ""checking the details of the list and are currently in contact with all of the families"". A senior US official said on Wednesday that at least three American citizens - including three-year-old Avigail Idan, an Israeli dual national whose parents were killed in Kibbutz Kfar Aza - would be among the 50 hostages. A senior Israeli official said on Tuesday afternoon that Hamas could also unilaterally release the 26 Thai nationals believed to be among the hostages. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been designated to receive the hostages in Gaza, as its staff did when Hamas freed two Israeli-American women and two Israeli women last month. On Wednesday night, Mr Netanyahu quoted the agreement as saying that the ICRC would also ""be allowed to visit the remainder of the hostages and to give them required medications"". However, Mr Ansari was unable to disclose whether that was the case. Israeli forces operating inside Gaza have also rescued one female soldier and recovered the bodies of two other female hostages - a soldier and a civilian. The Israeli government said it would ""continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza"". A longer Hamas statement issued on Wednesday morning gave more details of what Israeli military action was expected to cease for the duration of what it called a ""hudna"", or temporary truce. It said all drone and Israeli aircraft activity was expected to stop for four days in the south of Gaza. But in the north - which has been the main target of Israeli operations to dismantle Hamas - the same will only hold between 10:00 and 16:00 local time (08:00-14:00 GMT) each day. Israeli troops and tanks are expected to remain in their positions inside Gaza during the four-day pause, but the Hamas statement said Israeli forces would not attack or arrest anyone. Mr Ansari said there would be ""a comprehensive ceasefire"" in the north and south, while Qatar's chief negotiator, Minister of State Mohammed al-Khulaifi, told Reuters news agency that there would be ""no attack whatsoever, no military movements, no expansion, nothing"". For Palestinians in Gaza, 1.7 million of whom have fled their homes according to the UN, a respite in the brutal fighting cannot come soon enough. The deal will allow 200 lorries carrying aid, four fuel tankers and four lorries carrying cooking gas to enter Gaza via Egypt's Rafah crossing on each of the four days. But it is understood that the boost in fuel - desperately needed for hospital generators, water desalination and sewage facilities - will only last for as long as the pause. Mr Ansari said the additional aid would start going into Gaza as soon as possible after the pause began on Friday morning and there was a period of calm that made it safe for humanitarian workers. Israel cut off electricity and most water, and stopped deliveries of food, fuel and other goods to Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's attack. It allowed 1,399 lorryloads of humanitarian supplies to enter via Egypt between 21 October and 21 November, compared to a monthly average of 10,000 before the war, according to the UN. It blocked all fuel deliveries until last week, saying it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes. And although the deal will allow people in Gaza safe passage from north to south, it will not permit the hundreds of thousands of displaced people from the north to return home. Hamas said that the deal would also see 150 Palestinian prisoners - all women and children - released by Israel. The Israeli government statement did not mention that, but on Wednesday morning its justice ministry published a list in Hebrew ofthe names of 300 prisoners eligible for releaseas part of the deal - based on the possibility that Hamas will agree to free 50 more hostages. The list comprises 123 boys aged between 14 and 17, one 15-year-old girl, 144 18-year-old men, and 32 women aged between 18 and 59. Most are remanded in custody while awaiting trial on charges that range from stone-throwing to attempted murder. The reason the list had to be published is because of a legal formality in Israel. Ahead of any prisoner release, Israeli citizens must be allowed 24 hours to make an appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court. Mr Ansari said Qatar could not disclose any details about the Palestinian prisoners or how many would be freed on the first day. But he did suggest that the releases would happen at the same time as those of the hostages in Gaza. Israel is currently holding about 7,000 Palestinians accused or convicted of security offences, according to Israeli and Palestinian rights groups. Almost 3,000 Palestinians are reported to have been arrested in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where violence has also surged, since 7 October. Hamas's statement ended by saying the deal aimed to ""serve our people and strengthen their steadfastness in the face of aggression"". It also warned: ""Our fingers remain on the trigger, and our victorious fighters will remain on the look out to defend our people and defeat the occupation."" Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said an operations room in Doha would maintain real-time lines of communication with Israel, the Hamas political office, and the ICRC, so that any possible breach is ""communicated immediately to both sides and there is a way to walk back from it"". The most important thing was to ""make sure that the environment in which the hostage transfer will happen will be a safe one"", he added. Mr Ansari said Qatar hoped to extend the temporary truce beyond the initial four days by securing the release of more hostages. He also expressed hope that it would serve as a ""proof of concept for further de-escalation measures... and a more sustainable truce in Gaza"".",2023-11-23T17:54:16.000Z

Gaza war: Father of twins killed in Hamas attack says he is broken by deathsPublished23 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"For the father of 12-year-old twins Yannai and Liel Hetzroni-Heller the last few weeks have been filled with agonising waits and devastating news. It was nearly six weeks after the attacks by Hamas in Israel before Gavin Heller, from London, had confirmation that both his children had been killed. The twins were killed at Kibbutz Be'eri with their great-aunt and grandfather. Mr Heller said so little was found of Liel's body that some of her toys were buried at a ceremony instead. ""I don't even know how to put this into words,"" he told the BBC. ""They just found remnants of Liel... initially they didn't have enough pieces to make a formal identification. They identified her literally by sieving the remnants. This will unfortunately live with me for the rest of my life."" Israeli media has reported the children, who were British-Israeli, were held hostage by Hamas gunmen in a building that caught fire during a stand-off with Israeli forces. His daughter was finally identified just five days ago, with the help of forensic archaeologists. ""I was literally inconsolable with grief, not finding her body and at least having something to bury."" The children's great-aunt, who helped raise them after their mother suffered brain damage giving birth, and their grandfather were also murdered. Mr Heller believes they were killed for just one reason. ""It's something that is such a shock that people can do this to other human beings just because they were Jewish. ""There was no other reason why these Hamas terrorists came in the kibbutz other than to kill, murder, maim Jewish children, babies, parents and old people all because they lived in the Jewish homeland."" Mr Heller says Liel was ""a bundle of energy, an extrovert. She loved to perform. She was like a princess. She was very popular and liked to be the centre of attention."" He said Yannai was a very sporty child who loved tennis, football and basketball. ""He had a shyness about him that I think everyone respected... he was a lovely boy who was really coming into his own in terms of his character and personality."" He mourns the life the twins will not now have. ""They really loved each other and unfortunately they will never be able to live their life to do what they wanted to do in the future and that really is a crying shame, an absolute tragedy... I won't watch them grow up, I will never see them get married, I will never see the flourish as normal teenagers would."" Mr Heller, who lives in the UK, recalled the agony of not knowing what had happened to his children for weeks after the attack on 7 October. ""It was just an utter sense of fear, terror... not knowing whether they were hostages in Gaza. The worst thing is I wasn't able to protect them... and being in London not knowing where they were. It was agonising, absolutely agonising."" Before the attack occurred, Mr Heller had been due to visit his children in October. Liel, he said, had asked him to bring her some perfume. ""I have lost both my children who I cared for deeply and loved."" There were 1,200 Israelis killed by Hamas on 7 October and more than 200 still being held hostage in Gaza. Mr Heller has one wish. ""Something of this magnitude should never happen again. The world must come together and ensure this awful atrocity should never happen, ever, ever again.""",2023-11-23T15:43:17.000Z

Israeli forces detain director of Gaza's al-Shifa HospitalPublished23 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli forces have detained the director of Gaza City's al-Shifa Hospital for questioning, a week after their controversial raid there. Dr Mohammed Abu Salmiya was held at a checkpoint as he evacuated patients to the south, a colleague told the BBC. The Israeli military said he was being questioned over evidence that al-Shifa ""served as a Hamas command and control centre"". He and Hamas have denied that. Meanwhile, heavy fire was reported around another hospital in the north. A doctor at the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia said Israeli troops had also ordered its full evacuation. The Israeli military said it was checking the reports. Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip with the objective of destroying Hamas - which it classes as a terrorist organisation - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,500 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the Israeli air and ground strikes began, while the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian crisis. On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to exchange 50 of the hostages - all children and women - for a four-day pause in the fighting. Mediator Qatar says the truce will start at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday, with the first group of 13 hostages to be released at 16:00. About 250 patients and staff members are estimated to remain at al-Shifa, which is the biggest medical facility in Gaza but is no longer operational. On Wednesday, 190 wounded and sick people, their companions, and a number of medical teams were evacuated from the hospital in an ambulance convoy to the south, in co-ordination with the World Health Organization and other humanitarian agencies, according to the United Nations. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said in a statement overnightthat the evacuation process lasted for almost 20 hours ""as the convoy was obstructed and subjected to careful inspection while passing through the checkpoint"" on Salah al-Din Road that separates northern and southern Gaza. ""Furthermore, three paramedics and a companion of a wounded person were detained. The latter and two paramedics were later released, while the third paramedic, colleague Awni Khattab, is still detained until this moment."" Neither the UN or PRCS mentioned Dr Abu Salmiya. But the head of orthopaedics at al-Shifa, Dr Adnan al-Bursh, told the BBC he had also been detained while accompanying the evacuated patients on Wednesday. On Thursday afternoon, the Israeli military confirmed that Dr Abu Salmiya had been taken for questioning by the Shin Bet internal security agency, ""following evidence showing that al-Shifa Hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control centre"". ""The Hamas terror tunnel network situated under the hospital also exploited electricity and resources taken from the hospital. In addition, Hamas stored numerous weapons inside the hospital and on the hospital grounds. ""Furthermore, after the Hamas massacre on 7 October, Hamas terrorists sought refuge within the hospital, some of them taking hostages from Israel with them,"" it added, also alleging that a female soldier who had been taken hostage was murdered on the premises. Hamas has repeatedly denied that the hospital was used as a shelter by fighters, as have hospital staff and health ministry officials. Hamas has also claimed the soldier was killed in an Israeli air strike. On Wednesday, the Israeli military showed embedded journalists what it said was further evidence of a Hamas ""terror tunnel complex"" beneath al-Shifa. A Reuters news agency reporter said he had accessed a reinforced underground tunnel through an outdoor shaft in the hospital's grounds. The tunnel led to a series of rooms, including a bathroom, kitchen and an air conditioned meeting room that the military said was used by Hamas commanders, he added. Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. This protection extends to patients, as well as to medical staff and ambulances. However, hospitals can lose their protection if they are used by a party to the conflict to commit an ""act harmful to the enemy"". In a separate development on Thursday, a senior doctor and a health ministry official said Israeli troops had ordered the full evacuation of the Indonesian Hospital, outside which fighting has been raging in recent days. The Indonesian Hospital's medical director, Dr Marwan Sultan, told the BBC the situation inside was ""very difficult"", with ""heavy firing continuing around the hospital, from tanks, every 15 minutes"". ""We cannot stay in rooms, as the windows are being hit,"" he said. ""We are staying in corridors in the hospital. My office was targeted several times."" ""We are currently 10 medical professionals and 200 patients. No Israeli soldiers are currently inside the hospital, but we expect the same scenario as al-Shifa to happen unless the truce takes place,"" he added. ""We asked Gaza's health ministry for three buses today to evacuate the Indonesian Hospital, and we asked also for 13 ambulances for patients who cannot be seated. They are liaising with the Red Cross."" The Israeli military said on Thursday morning that its troops were ""striking terror targets"" in the Jabalia area, which is just to the south of the hospital. On Monday, the health ministry said 12 patients and other civilians at the hospital had been killed by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said its troops had targeted ""terrorists"" who opened fire at them from inside the facility. Deadly Israeli strikes were also reported in the north of Gaza on Thursday, as well as in the southern city of Khan Younis.",2023-11-23T14:52:17.000Z

Pro-Palestinian protesters halt council meetingPublished23 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Police are investigating how pro-Palestinian protestors - some with their faces covered - disrupted a council meeting in Londonderry. The demonstrators held up a banner saying: ""Expel the Israeli ambassador."" The S letters on it were written like the symbol of the SS, a Nazi military unit that ran concentration and death camps and killed millions of Jews during the Holocaust. The protesters wanted the council to implement a boycott of Israeli goods. Some unionists on Derry and Strabane District Council condemned the protest as antisemitic after the incident at the Guildhall on Wednesday evening. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) councillor Niree McMorris said she and her colleagues felt ""intimidated"" by the protestors and were ""frozen to their seats"". ""People started coming in from all doors, doors that I may add are private and they shouldn't have had access to,"" she told theBBC's The North West Today. ""I don't know how people were able to access them and get in. It was unacceptable - there was shouting and it was absolute chaos. ""It was frightening - I had a colleague who was crying beside me and didn't know what to do."" The mayor, Sinn Féin's Patricia Logue, suspended the meeting early and said the protest had left some staff ""unnerved"". She had asked those protestors who had covered their faces to ""take down their masks in the interests of openness"". In a statement issued on Thursday, Sinn Féin said it was ""opposed to all forms of hatred and discrimination, including racism, sectarianism, homophobia and antisemitism. ""It has no place in our society,"" said the party. Catherine Hutton, of the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, was due to address the meeting at the time and told councillors that her campaign group was against antisemitism in any form. Speaking to BBC News NI about the banner, Ms Hutton said it ""does not have anything to do with us"". She said that while she agrees with the statement calling for expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, she ""does not agree with the Nazi insignias"" and that her group is ""against all sorts of discrimination"". Ms Hutton added that she had asked for the banner to be removed and for anyone wearing masks to take them off ""because it was inappropriate"". Earlier a pro-Palestinian protest had taken place outside the Guildhall. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin described what happened in the council chamber as a ""side issue"". ""There is absolutely nothing antisemitic about a banner that says: 'Expel the Israeli ambassador',"" he said. Asked why some of those who unfurled it had their faces covered, he said he would encourage people not to wear masks. He added: ""There was over 100 people at the [earlier] protest yesterday. I think it was great that it happened. ""I don't think there should be business as usual when there is a genocidal war going on. ""This was a peaceful act of civil disobedience. I think there needs to be protests like this happening right across this island."" The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it was investigating whether any offences had been committed during the incident inside the Guildhall. A Derry City and Strabane District council spokeswoman said ""a grouping"" had entered the public gallery and council had suspended standing orders, with the meeting being subsequently adjourned. Some political parties and campaign groups across the island havecalled for Israel's ambassador to Ireland to be expelledfollowing the start of the Israel-Gaza war.",2023-11-23T14:09:41.000Z

Palestinian-Americans struggle with survivors' guiltPublished23 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"For many Palestinian-Americans living thousands of miles away from Gaza but watching the deadly violence from afar, it's more than grief that grips them - it's also guilt. ""I think guilt is a feeling that a lot of Palestinians in the diaspora feel because every single Palestinian has Palestine in their heart, no matter where we live,"" says Anees, a Palestinian-American musician who lives in Virginia. The 31-year-old has a huge Instagram following of 1.7 million people, and since the start of the Israel-Gaza war has used his platform to post about the war and call for a ceasefire. ""When we see the devastation, when we see the killings, I think inherently we feel this guilt that it could have been us,"" he says. Since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 people hostage, the Israeli military has responded with a heavy bombing campaign which it says is aimed at Hamas but which the UN says is ""wiping out whole families and entire neighbourhoods"". More than 14,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Palestinian-Americans who spoke to the BBC say watching what's happening in Gaza unfold on social media feeds and TV screens has been emotionally debilitating. ""Everything I enjoy - every little thing - from the smallest to the biggest joy, my second thought is [Palestinians in Gaza] don't get to enjoy this,"" says Anees. ""I'm still able to go with safety to the grocery store without being bombed. I'm still able to go out to dinner without being bombed."" In the minds of many Palestinian-Americans, the answers for how and why they're in the US only add to the complexity of emotions - many are the children and grandchildren of Palestinians who fled previous wars. Jinan Deena, born in Ohio and one of seven million Palestinians around the world, says her grandmother was one of up to 750,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced out of their homes at gunpoint in the war that followed Israel's creation in 1948. This violent displacement is what Palestinians today call al Nakba, or ""the Catastrophe"", and it pushed Jinan's grandparents to want to leave, she says. Her family first resettled in the West Bank, where Jinan's mother was born, before coming to the US in 1981. ""Sometimes I wonder what if my mom stayed, and I was born and raised there?"" Jinan, 41, spent many summers in the West Bank and lived there for two years as a teenager. But her family eventually returned to the US because ""it just wasn't easy for us to go from living in America to living under occupation"". The presence of Israeli military tanks and checkpoints, tear gas and rubber bullets was too much, she says. ""I look back at us leaving, and I'm like, 'Was that a cowardly thing to do? What makes me better than them?' Palestinian guilt has different levels to it."" The US sends Israel billions of dollars in military aid every year, and a bill is making its way through Congress which would send more. ""I also feel guilty as an American, because my tax money is going to fund this huge war,"" says Jinan. The rising death toll has intensified the emotional distress of Palestinian Americans. At least 5,600 children in Gaza have died since 7 October, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And the number grows each day, ""becoming a graveyard for children"", according to the UN. ""I feel helpless, and I feel hopeless,"" says Jinan. ""I find joy in absolutely nothing."" Feelings of guilt are also amplified by news of living conditions on the ground. Residents of Gaza have had their access to water cut off by Israeli blockades, and are facing food and water shortages and disease. Some residents of Gaza have told the BBC that they have been driven to drink sea water. ""I was running water into a massive pot to boil potatoes and I just broke down crying,"" Marcelle Afram recalls. ""Here I am just being able to turn on the faucet and literally pour more water into one pot to boil potatoes than one person in Gaza is able to have in an entire week right now."" Marcelle, a food catering business owner in Washington DC, says feelings of guilt have moved him to turn down work that isn't related to fundraising for Palestinian causes. ""If I don't use everything at my disposal to help, I will have to live with that for the rest of my life."" It's a sentiment echoed by Anees, who says he only uses his platform now to speak about the war. Stephanie, an administrator of a Facebook group for Palestinians, says she feels similarly. She asked that we not use her last name, saying she has received threatening messages on Facebook since becoming more vocally pro-Palestinian. Pregnant with her first child, intense nausea and fatigue kept her on the sidelines during some of the initial protests in Boston. Instead, she says she tried to be an ""activist at home"" and made calls to her state representatives urging for a ceasefire. ""I would feel bad. Part of me was like, 'People are dying, and you feel sick and you're going to stay home?'"" Eventually, she says her feeling of ""personal responsibility"" outweighed the discomforts of her pregnancy. She attended a pro-Palestine rally in Boston on 22 October, the biggest she had ever been to in her life. It was moving, and it made her feel something else she said she hadn't in a while - hopeful. ""It made me feel like maybe we could make a difference.""",2023-11-23T10:59:31.000Z

Liverpool City Council votes to support calls for Gaza ceasefirePublished23 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Labour-run council has voted to support calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Hours after Israel and Hamasagreed to a four-day pause in fighting, Liverpool councillors agreed to support a motion pushing for it to become ""the basis for a permanent ceasefire"". The vote followed days of debate and negotiation between the parties on the council, over the motion's wording. The full council meeting in the city's Town Hall was held as demonstrators outside called for a ceasefire. Liberal group leader Steve Radford, who proposed the motion, said the amended text had only been finally agreed ""at the eleventh hour"". The motion had been tabled by opposition councillors, leaving Labour to have to decide whether to support it or not. It is understood there were internal splits in the city's 61-strong Labour group on how to respond. The decision to support the call for a ceasefire potentially put Labour councillors on a collision course with the national party, as it comes seven days after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer sacked a number of frontbench MPs forbacking an SNP motion to call for a ceasefire. Council leader Liam Robinson denied the local party's stance went against the party's stance nationally. ""I don't think this puts us at odds with anyone,"" he said. ""What we are marking is that we are pleased that this international agreement has been found as the start of a process of returning hostages which is something everyone wants to see. ""Hopefully, this will lead to proper international engagement that can lead to a proper peaceful settlement into the future."" Outside the meeting, about 100 people with Palestinian flags and banners gathered, chanting ""ceasefire now"" and ""free Palestine"". The amended motion, which all councillors voted for, said the ""four-day ceasefire and hostage return"" was ""a welcome first step which we hope will become the basis for a permanent ceasefire and long-term settlement"". References to ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"" were removed from the text and a commitment to ""reject any and all inflammatory rhetoric"" was added. The meeting was also addressed by Tawhid Islam from the Liverpool region mosque network and Merseyside Jewish Representative Council chairman Max Marcus. Speaking together after the meeting, Mr Marcus said the conflict was ""impacting significantly"" on ""relationships between Israelis and Palestinians, Jews and Muslims living on Merseyside"" and there had been ""a substantial rise in anti-Semitism from all quarters"". He added he was pleased Liverpool City Council had come up with ""an acceptable way forward"". Tawhid Islam said communities across Liverpool had been ""coming together"" to discuss the conflict ""and they have different opinions"", so there needed to be ""more balance to the narrative"". He added those communities were clearly ""on the side of humanity and we want to see the fighting stop, the killing stop"". Speaking after the meeting, Mr Robinson said it was a ""challenging issue"" and he understood some residents might question why a local council was debating international affairs. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Clein said he was unsure why that was as it was ""not for us to pass comment on military conflict"". Underlining the anti-Semitic abuse he had personally suffered, he said the council had previously heard some ""inflammatory"" comments that could divide communities and no other global conflicts had been the subject of a formal motion. Mr Radford said ""if things go wrong"", the conflict could lead to more displaced people in Liverpool. ""In my ward, we have a high number of refugees - it has an impact on us,"" he said. He added other councils would be listening to Liverpool. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,XandInstagram?

London hate crime: Worry over 'significant fracture' in communitiesPublished23 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"It will take London communities a long time to heal from the increase in tension over the conflict in Gaza, charities have said. Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crimes have increased markedly in the capital since October. The Community Security Trust said Jewish people were feeling fearful. Tell Mama, which supports those impacted by Islamophobia, said there was a ""significant fracture"" in community cohesion. Iman Atta, from the charity, added: ""It's quite deep; the bridges that we've built are shaken. ""This isn't just amongst different communities, it's within families where some support different communities, different causes, so we've seen even families aren't even talking to each other."" Figures from the Met Police show since 1 October and 13 November, there were 779 antisemitic hate crimes recorded in London, an increase of 1,200% on the same period as last year. For Islamophobic hate crime, the same time period has seen a 236% increase to 343 reports. The Tell MAMA project said it received reports of 69 anti-Muslim cases in London from October 7 to November 19. Ms Atta said since 7 October, the charity has received 500 cases of anti-Muslim hate in London, while last year in the same timeframe it was dealing with 70. These included people being ""shouted at, called terrorists, murderers"" and women having their headscarves pulled, she said. Ms Atta added hate crime was heightened in London because there were larger Jewish and Muslim communities and that protests were held in the capital because it is where the main government buildings are. ""Emotions are very high, people are angry,"" she said. ""People are sometimes unable to express their emotions, feeling unable to speak, feeling censored, feeling grief."" She added people ""were not ready"" to sit with other communities and listen to what each other has to say. Dave Rich, from the Community Security Trust (CST), said Jewish people were experiencing physical assaults, verbal abuse, antisemitic graffiti and online hate. He said it was mainly concentrated in parts of London where the Jewish community mostly live, including Barnet, Hackney and Haringey, but that the charity was also seeing antisemitism in central London on the fringes of some of the big protests. ""Normally it's a great city to be Jewish, but right now a lot of Jewish Londoners are not feeling that way,"" he said. Mayor Sadiq Khan said hate crime was having a ""chilling effect"" which was ""heartbreaking"". ""You may not be the direct victim of antisemitic hate crime, or Islamophobic hate crime, but you feel it. ""There's this thing called heightened fear. People are now scared to leave their homes."" This week, he announced an extra £250,000 in funding to be shared by groups in the Community Alliance To Combat Hate (CATCH) partnership of which Tell Mama and CST are members of. Mr Rich said: ""We can't control what happens in a conflict thousands of miles away, but we can influence what happens here and how people in London respond to that. ""We can set an example and we can try and influence our own communities and wider society."" Ms Atta agreed, adding that although it would take a while to rebuild that ""London fabric that the whole world speaks about and we're proud of"", she hoped the spirit of Christmas would bring the wider London community together, ""maybe in the same room, and maybe at one point they'll be able to listen to each other"". Mr Rich added: ""I fear that once this conflict is over the damage on relations between communities will take a long time to heal but there's no time like the present to start working on it.""

Gaza hostages deal: 'Until I see them with my own eyes I won't believe anything'Published23 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hen Avigdori is a well-known Israeli television comedy writer who says his mission has always been to make people laugh. But for the past 48 days, that has changed to a campaign to get ""my girls back."" The last contact he had with his family - wife Sharon, who's 52, and their 12-year old daughter, Noam - was on 7 October, at 10am, when they said they were going to the safe room and everything was going to be okay. ""They had gone to visit a very peaceful kibbutz in the south of Israel. Nothing would have prepared us for the awful situation that followed,"" says Hen. ""We were all supposed to go to Kibbutz Be'eri to visit my wife's brother, but at the last minute the boys decided to stay at home and the girls went away. The next thing we knew there was a big mess in the south, and they were declared as missing - for the first two weeks - and then we got the 'kidnapped' status."" For Hen Avigdori's family and the vast majority of the hostages, there has been no proof of life. With a hostage release deal announced on Wednesday, he is hopeful that his wife and daughter will be among those released. ""Hope has been the only thing that kept us going over the past 48 days,"" he says. ""But I am also very cautious, I don't get my hope too high. As I explained to my 16-year-old son and all the family, till the day I see the girls with my own two eyes, we won't believe anything."" Hen says he has been trying not to think about the conditions in which they're being kept. Hamas says it has hidden the hostages in ""safe places and tunnels"" within Gaza. ""I try not to imagine,"" he says, ""I try not to think about that because I have a mission and the mission is to get them out. The more I think about their condition, the more depressed I get."" Meanwhile Hen has met senior figures in the Israeli government, the Red Cross, and what he calls a ""very senior member of the Qatari negotiating team"". And, he says, he has put a lot of pressure on the Israeli government to prioritise hostage release over military victory. On Monday, during a heated debate between Israeli politicians and the family members in the Israeli Knesset, Hen pleaded with parliament members to ""stop talking about killing Arabs and start talking about saving Jews."" Hen says he always believed that in the end there was no way to get his family out without a deal. A military option to get 240 people out of Gaza is not feasible, he believes. But he adds that ""there'll be no good feeling about the deal even after all the hostages are released, until Hamas feels the Israeli boots on the ground."" Hen says that it means ""bringing an end to the existence of Hamas and releasing every single hostage from captivity are interlinked."" Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, is an American-Israeli citizen who has been missing since Hamas's attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz. His father, Jonathan, says the deal might be seen as a sign of things to come, but, like Hen, he says he will only believe it when he sees the first group of hostages cross into Israel. ""My son is a peace-loving civilian who has two daughters and his wife is eight months pregnant. I, my Kibbutz Nir Oz and the whole country will of course welcome the women and children back into our community - if the deal actually happens. Up until that moment we'll be cautious, we're talking here about negotiating with a barbaric organisation."" Others hostages' families expressed the same caution, that at the last minute the deal might be jeopardised by new demands. Abigail, a three-year-old Israeli-American, was taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October after both her parents were killed. ""We're hoping and praying that she is one of the first groups,"" her great aunt Liz Hirsh Naftali told CBS, the BBC's US partner. Abigail's cousin Noa Naftali added they were ""cautiously hopeful, every day"". The deal is only ""the beginning of a journey that needs to end with the release of all of the hostages,"" says Ruby Chen. His son, Itay, 19, is an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier who was on active duty with a tank unit on 7 October when he was taken. After hearing the news of the deal, Ruby said he was joyful that the hostages, all of whom he described as ""the extended new family members"", would be coming home. Chen knows that his son will not be among the 50 to be released, but the deal is like ""a framework"", and it is in place. It can be a sign of hope for other deals to happen in the near future, he says.",2023-11-23T02:25:04.000Z

Arnolfini gallery cancels Palestine film festival eventsPublished22 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An art gallery has cancelled two Palestinian film events amidst ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The Arnolfini, Bristol, withdrew its offer to host the festival over concerns it could be ""construed as political activity"". More than 1,500 people have signed an open letter, criticising the venue's decision. The events are still scheduled to take place elsewhere in the city. Hosted across four venues from 2 to 10 December, Bristol's Palestine Film Festival aims to celebrate Middle Eastern culture by showcasing contemporary film and arts. A screening of Farha, a coming-of-age film based on a true story, and a live poetry night headlined by rapper and activist Lowkey, were due to take place at the venue on 2 December. Arnolfiniannounced on 21 Novemberthe ""challenging"" and ""difficult"" decision not to host the scheduled events. In a statement released by the venue, festival organisers cited concerns that the performances and discussion panels might ""stray into political activity"". Organisers also said they did not have the resources to properly assess risks for the event in light of current tensions. They add they were ""legally obliged"" as an arts charity to follow government guidance on remaining apolitical. ""We shared these reasons with the Bristol Palestinian Film Festival. We understand their disappointment,"" the Arnolfini said in its statement. ""We are pleased that the events are still scheduled to take place elsewhere in the city,"" they added. Watershed, their partner venue, will now host the screening of Farha and the poetry event will be held at Sparks. Arnolfini has faced backlash since its announcement, with 1,574 people so farsigning an open letter criticising the decision. ""These events were intended to explore the issue of increasing silencing and censorship of Palestinian and pro-Palestinian voices in the arts,"" the letter reads. ""We find it particularly ironic and disappointing that Arnolfini has chosen to withdraw from these events, indicating its unwillingness to take a stand against such censorship in arts and culture,"" it adds. Alison Sterling, member of the board of trustees for the Palestine Film Festival, said: ""We'd prefer not to comment on the decision by Arnolfini at this time, in order to keep the focus on the films, the filmmakers and the people of Palestine, and to deliver a great festival for the people of Bristol.""

Jeremy Hunt pledges £7m to tackle antisemitismPublished22 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Jeremy Hunt has pledged up to £7m over the next three years to charities tackling antisemitism in the UK. The chancellor unveiled the measure while delivering the government's Autumn Statement on Wednesday. Mr Hunt expressed his ""horror"" at the Hamas attack on Israel last month, and said he was ""deeply concerned about the rise of antisemitism"" in the UK. Police have recorded a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents since the conflict broke out on 7 October. ""I am deeply concerned about the rise of antisemitism in our country, so I am announcing up to £7 million over the next three years for organisations like the Holocaust Educational Trust to tackle antisemitism in schools and universities,"" Mr Hunt told the Commons. The Holocaust Educational Trust is a charity which aims to educate people about the Holocaust and support survivors. Mr Hunt said he will ""repeat the £3m uplift"" to the Community Security Trust (CST), a charity which helps Jewish people in the UK.  In October, the CST was given £3m of additional funding to ""protect schools, synagogues and other Jewish community buildings"". ""When it comes to antisemitism and all forms of racism, we must never allow the clock to be turned back,"" he added. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves welcomed the announcement, saying that there was ""no place for hate in our society"". Hamas launched a surprise assault on Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages. Israel responded with air strikes on Gaza and has launched a ground offensive. At least 13,300 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The CST has said antisemitic incidents in the UK have more than quadrupled since the Hamas attack. The group recorded 89 ""anti-Jewish hate"" incidents from 7 to 10 October. That marked a more than four-fold rise on the 21 antisemitic incidents recorded in the same period last year. Antisemitic hate crime has risen sharply in London, with408 offences recorded in Octobercompared to 28 in the same period last year. The Metropolitan Police says it has made 75 arrests linked to the Israel-Gaza conflict, and is investigating 10 potential breaches of terrorism laws. Justin Cohen, news editor and co-publisher of Jewish News,recently saidthe Jewish community felt ""full of dread, full of fear, like I've never seen before"".",2023-11-22T14:26:10.000Z

Humza Yousaf urges PM to recognise Palestinian statePublished21 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Scotland's first minister has urged the UK government to recognise a Palestinian state. In a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Humza Yousaf said the move would help to end the ""political impasse"" in the Middle East. It came as MSPs backed his motion to the Scottish Parliament by 90 votes to 28 to call for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict. The motion won the support of all parties except the Conservatives. They called for ""humanitarian pauses"" instead. That is the position taken by the UK government and the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - though Scottish Labour want a ceasefire. Ahead of the debate, Mr Yousaf wrote a letter to Mr Sunak urging him to recognise a Palestinian state within the borders set out in 1967. A similar letter was also sent to Sir Keir, urging him to back the calls. The first minister said the move would help to end the ""political impasse that has condemned Israelis and the Palestinians to successive cycles of violence"". Mr Yousaf, whose parents-in-lawrecently escaped Gaza, told MSPs: ""It's only with full recognition of Palestine as a state in its own right that we can truly move forward towards a two-state solution."" The UK governmentpreviously saidit would only recognise a Palestinian state at the ""right time"". A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: ""As the prime minister has said, we continue to support a just solution to the conflict for both sides and remain committed to a two-state solution that protects the peace and security of both Israelis and Palestinians, with the West Bank and Gaza part of a viable and sovereign Palestinian state."" While 138 UN members, including nine in the EU, recognise a Palestinian state, the United States and most large European countries do not. However, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez said last week that his government would seek to recognise Palestinian statehood. TheSNP motionsaid the parliament condemned the""barbaric and unjustifiable terrorist attacks"" by Hamas on 7 October and the killing of civilians, including women and children, in Israel's siege of Gaza. It called for hostages to be released, humanitarian aid to be increased, international law to be upheld and for a two-state peace solution. The motion also expressed ""solidarity with Scotland's Jewish, Muslim and Palestinian communities and condemns antisemitism, Islamophobia or any other form of hatred"". The first minister said that while Israel had the right to defend itself, it must respect international law. Mr Yousaf said that doctors in Gaza, including his brother in law, were being forced to carry out ""medieval"" procedures without proper supplies of anaesthetics. ""In the face of such destruction, death and inhumanity, an immediate ceasefire, agreed by all sides, is needed to ensure the protection of innocent civilians and the delivery of essential supplies,"" the first minister said. He insisted ""humanitarian pauses"" were not sufficient. ""Simply a pause in the killing of innocent men, women and children only, what, to resume a few hours later? Surely we must and can strive for better than that,"" Mr Yousaf added. ""For the sake of the people of Gaza who are living in a nightmare of unimaginable terror and for the Israeli hostages who remain captive, this parliament and the international community must unite and call for an immediate ceasefire."" Since the Holyrood motion was passed, Israel and Hamas haveagreed a dealto release 50 hostages being held in Gaza during a four-day pause in fighting. However, Hamas has reportedly vowed to carry out further attacks like that of 7 October. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would not stop fighting until all the hostages were brought home. Israel began attacking Gaza after Hamas fighters crossed the border on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 200 others hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 13,300 people, including more than 5,000 children, have been killed in Israel's campaign. A Scottish Labour amendment, tabled by Anas Sarwar and backed by the SNP, stated it would require ""all sides to comply"" with a ceasefire and called on the International Criminal Court to investigate both sides of the conflict. It was passed by MSPs. The call for a ceasefire put Scottish Labour at odds with Sir Keir, who has instead called for ""humanitarian pauses"". Mr Sarwar told MSPs: ""For a ceasefire to work, all sides must be willing to comply. ""And secondly we must recognise that Hamas has made clear that it intends to repeat the October 7 massacre, intends to continue rocket fire, and tragically, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear that he is not willing to even consider a ceasefire. ""That's why the full force of international diplomacy must be used to create the conditions to make an immediate ceasefire a reality."" UK Labour leader Sir Keir has argued that a ceasefire would not be appropriate because it would freeze the conflict and embolden Hamas. He saw 56 of his MPs rebel last week as they backed an SNP motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in the House of Commons. Both Scottish Labour MPs - Ian Murray and Michael Shanks - abstained. The Scottish Greens and Scottish Liberal Democrats supported the ceasefire demand, while the Tories instead backed ""humanitarian pauses to deliver aid to Gaza safely and in a sustained way"". The party's amendment was rejected by MSPs. Compared with a formal ceasefire, such pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours. Scottish Conservative MSP Donald Cameron told the chamber that a ceasefire was opposed by the US government, as well as the UK leadership of the Conservative and Labour parties. ""A ceasefire requires both of the two opposing sides to support it and regrettably it has been clear for some time now that Hamas will not respect a ceasefire,"" he said. ""Hamas does not even respect the right of Israel to exist, let alone work towards peace.""",2023-11-21T19:47:34.000Z

Lebanon PM says Israeli strikes killed journalistsPublished21 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Four people, including two journalists, have been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon, local media say, as exchanges of fire intensify along the border. Lebanon's prime minister condemned the ""attack"" in the village of Tayr Harfa that killed an Al Mayadeen TV reporter and cameraman along with another man. Israel's military said it had ""operated against a threat"" in the same area and that it was reviewing the incident. An elderly woman was also reportedly killed in Kfarkela, to the east. Earlier, Israeli aircraft struck what the military said were ""terrorist cells"" in the border area as well as targets belonging to the Lebanese group Hezbollah, which has repeatedly fired missiles and mortar shells across the border since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip six weeks ago. Al Mayadeen, a Beirut-based Arabic TV channel, said its reporter Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih al-Maamari were ""deliberately targeted"" as they reported from Tayr Harfa, a village about 2km (1.2 miles) from the border. ""An Israeli warplane fired two rockets on Farah and Rabih's location,"" it said. ""Farah and Rabih had just ended a live broadcast at 10 AM [08:00 GMT], giving updates on the latest Israeli bombardment in South Lebanon."" A picture posted on social media appeared to show the journalists' bodies on the ground near a burning TV camera mounted on a tripod. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) said another civilian, whom it named as Hussein Aqeel, was killed. Al Mayadeen's director, Ghassan bin Jiddo, said he was a ""contributor"". ""This attack proves once again that there are no limits to Israeli crimes, and that its only goal is to silence the media that exposes its crimes and attacks,"" Lebanese Prime Minister Nabjib Mikati said, according to NNA. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that its soldiers had ""operated against a threat posed from a launching area of ​​the Hezbollah terrorist organisation"" in the Jibbain area, which is 1.5km east of Tayr Harfa. ""This is an area with active hostilities, where exchanges of fire occur. Presence in the area is dangerous. The incident is under review,"" it added. The IDF has previously insisted that it does not deliberately target journalists, but this would appear to be the third attack on journalists working in southern Lebanon since the start of the war. A fourth person, who NNA identified as 80-year-old Laiqa Sarhan, was killed and several family members were wounded in a strike on a village further east along the border, the aftermath of which was witnessed by a BBC team. Their house in Kfarkela was hit and badly damaged. Fire fighters from local civil defence units rushed to the scene to put out the blaze, as ambulances took the wounded family members, including children, to hospital. Earlier on Tuesday, the IDF put out a statement saying that aircraft had ""struck three armed terrorist cells in the area of the border"" and ""a number of Hezbollah terror targets, including military infrastructure and structures used for directing terrorist activity"". Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Shia Islamist group that wields considerable military and political power in Lebanon. It is considered a terrorist organisation by Israel, UK, the US and others. The deadly exchanges along the border escalated after 7 October, when Gaza-based gunmen from Hamas - another Iran-backed group that is also classed as a terrorist group by Israel and Western powers - attacked southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 240 others hostage. Israel launched a military operation to destroy Hamas in response to the attack. More than 14,000 people in Gaza have been killed, according to the Hamas-run government. Tuesday's incident in Lebanon comes almost a week after an Israeli attack hit an area in the village of Yaroun where a group of journalists was working. On 13 October, Israeli strikes killed a Reuters news agency cameraman, Issam Abdallah, and six other journalists were wounded as they reported on clashes near the border. Lebanon's public health ministry reports that at least 77 people, including combatants and civilians, have been killed due to armed clashes along the border with Israel, according to the UN. Israeli authorities say six soldiers and three civilians have been killed in northern Israel over the same period.",2023-11-21T17:48:16.000Z

Parents and siblings of UK woman killed in Gaza attackPublished21 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Twelve relatives of a UK woman, including her parents and four siblings, have been killed in an Israeli rocket attack in Gaza. Fatma Aljaja's nephew and nieces, brother-in-law and two sisters-in-law also died when rockets hit their apartment in Gaza City. Ms Aljaja, who left Gaza 10 years ago and now lives in Staffordshire, said the pain of losing them was ""like something you can't describe"". Rockets struck the home on 8 November. Her mother Noura Abu Hassira, 65, and father Ghanem Taufeek, 75, had decided not to evacuate south from their apartment, about a quarter of a mile from the Al-Shifa Hospital, because they felt there was no safe passage, she said. Thousands have been trapped at Gaza's largest hospitalby nearby battles between Israeli forces and Hamas miltants. Israel says Hamas fighters have operated in tunnels underneath the hospital, a claim denied by the group, which the UK government considers a terrorist organisation. Gaza-born Ms Aljaja lives with her husband Mohammed Sheraz in Burton-upon-Trent. They learnt of their deaths when a relative called them. ""It was eight o'clock on a Monday morning [and you] don't expect that phone call,"" said Mr Sheraz. ""She was shaking next to me asking 'who? who?' ""I think it took me 30 seconds to a minute to let it out but obviously Fatma was completely in bits at that stage."" The couple heard family members in Gaza spent the best part of three days digging the bodies out by hand. ""We are trying to stay strong but the burn is inside. You feel the burn inside you. I don't think this will go,"" Ms Aljaja said. ""Nobody will feel it until you lose your whole family in one second. ""It's something you can't describe. Some kind of pain you can't describe."" She said she believed the apartment had been targeted deliberately because of her brother Mohammed's aid and journalism work. The only member of the family to survive the rocket strikes was a niece, three-year-old Hannah, who was pulled from the rubble alive. She was treated for burns and other injuries but it is not clear what has happened to her since. Mr Sheraz said they had heard she was being cared for by her grandparents somewhere in the north of Gaza. ""Miraculously she survived that carnage… [but] she has lost everything,"" he said.

Councillor accused of blackmail over Gaza ceasefire emailPublished21 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A councillor who said he would publicly name other councillors who refused to sign a letter calling for a ceasefire in Gaza has been accused of blackmail. James Giles, an independent councillor, emailed 19,000 councillors urging them to sign the letter. In his email, he said: ""We will also be publishing the names of those who have been invited to sign but choose not to, in the interest of accountability."" The Local Government Association said the email caused ""worry and distress"". Councillors have also reacted angrily to the communication. Robert Reiss, a Liberal Democrat councillor in Sheffield said he supported calls for a ceasefire in the Gaza-Israel conflict, but wouldn't sign the letter. ""Using naming and shaming as blackmail for political action is deeply disturbing,""he said. Matt Dent a Labour councillor from Southend said: ""To my mind this is blackmail and a threat to councillors' safety whichgiven the murder of David Amessseems especially reckless."" A Labour councillor in Monmouthshire, Rachel Garrick, said: ""I won't be signing any letter that tries to intimidate people into signing it, no matter what the cause."" Mr Giles, who is a councillor in Kingston, south-west London, later sent a second email in which he said there was no intention to ""publish the names of councillors who actively refuse to sign the letter but object to their name being published"". He also posted a message on X, formerly Twitter,sayinghe would apologise to councillors who felt threatened by the email. However, responding to criticism that he was seeking to shame councillors, he said: ""It's called public accountability. If I support 20mph (I do), I expect those opposing 20mph to hold me to account."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Giles said: ""I do not believe in my heart of hearts I have done anything wrong"" adding that ""at no point was it ever claimed that those who didn't respond"" to the letter would be named. The letter, which accompanied the email, is addressed to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer and urges them to focus their efforts ""towards driving lasting peace in the region"". ""The collective punishment of civilians is never acceptable, whether perpetrated by Hamas or the Israeli military and enabled illegal settlers,"" it says. It adds that antisemitism is ""wholly unacceptable - however, this term cannot continue to be weaponised to absolve Israel of any accountability in how it has contributed to the ongoing tensions and its failure to comply with international law."" After the email and letter were sent to councillors, the Local Government Association issued a statement stating it ""does not endorse how this recent communication... was sent, nor the hurt, worry and distress that this has caused"". ""Pending investigation, Councillor Giles has stood down from all formal positions within the Local Government Association and all upcoming speaking opportunities at our events, with immediate effect."" Mr Giles has insisted he would not be resigning from his LGA roles, but rather had agreed to a ""temporary suspension"". The association also said the police and the Information Commissioner's Office - the UK's privacy watchdog - were ""aware of the ongoing situation"". Mr Giles said he had not heard from the police or the ICO, and added that he had got the list of councillors' emails from a list on a public website. The letter, but not the email, was co-drafted by another Kingston councillor, Conservative Jamal Chohan. The Kingston and Surbiton Conservative Association says the councillor has been removed from their group pending an investigation, but Mr Chohan has now resigned from the party altogether. In his resignation letter, he said the party acknowledged he didn't write the controversial email, but had nonetheless asked him to apologise ""as a matter of 'public perception'"". ""I will not apologise for something that I did not do and I am not prepared to represent the Conservative Party under its current administration,"" he said. He also accused the party of trying to ""silence advocates for peace"" and adopting ""far right"" policies. ""I cannot continue to associate with this type of politics and find that I am far too often having to apologise for representing the Conservative Party."" Speaking to the BBC, he said he felt ""betrayed, shocked and heartbroken"" by the party's actions.",2023-11-21T15:35:41.000Z

Palestinian football's 'star defender' among players stuck in GazaPublished21 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The rumble of continuous bombardment is a far cry from the sound of cheering fans and referees blowing their whistles - sounds that Ibrahim Abuimeir is used to. The 21-year-old is part of the Palestinian national football team along with two other players in Gaza - Ahmed Kullab and Khaled Al-Nabris. The three should have been training for the World Cup Qualifiers. The Palestinian team is due to play against Australia on Tuesday in Kuwait. But Ibrahim, Ahmed and Khaled were not able to make it to selections. They're stuck in Gaza and every day they face the threat of being killed. Ibrahim had a narrow escape. An air strike hit his neighbour's home on October 30. The impact also destroyed Ibrahim's house. Seventeen of his neighbours were killed in the attack. ""We found only one of the bodies intact. The others were ripped apart. Two bodies are still under the rubble. We haven't been able to dig them out. We've had to identify people from parts of their bodies,"" Ibrahim told Amr Tabash, a freelance journalist working for the BBC in Gaza. ""My grandparents were injured. It took us two days to pull them out."" We spoke to Ahmed Kullab over the phone. ""We find ourselves under a siege in a bloody conflict. The constant bombing makes life very unpredictable,"" he said. Ahmed's cousin was killed in an attack. Two of Ibrahim's teammates from RafaSports Club, his local team, have died. ""They were sitting in their homes thinking they were safe, and they were bombed,"" he said. After days of trying his phone, we were able to contact Khaled who confirmed he's in Gaza, but didn't want to be interviewed. Conditions are tough. ""Saltwater comes only once or twice a week. For drinking water, we currently rely on wells and water desalination using solar power,"" Ahmed said. Ibrahim, described by his trainers as one of the star defenders of the Palestinian team, starts his day standing in a queue for water. They say they are grateful to have survived so far, but it is a bleak life without the sport they love and which gives it meaning. ""I'm heartbroken. Getting the chance to participate in the World Cup would have been significant,"" said Ibrahim. ""Football is my whole life. No words can capture the depth of my emotions. For 44 days I haven't played, and each day gets harder than the previous one."" In the grief of war, this is the heartache of losing out on an opportunity, which can be crucial in sporting careers that often have short time spans. ""Football has been a dream for me from a very young age. I was so excited that I might be called up to the first team of the Palestinian football team. I'm very sad,"" said Ahmed. Ibrahim says he was able to watch ten minutes of one of the matches played by the Palestinian team, and he felt both sad and proud as he watched. I met Ehab Abujazar, one of the trainers of the Palestinian national football team, in Ramallah in the West Bank. He used to be a player himself and has trained Ahmed and Ibrahim for many years. Ehab's family is in Gaza too. ""My father passed away on the second day of the war, from illness. Sadly I couldn't travel to Gaza to bid him farewell and see him one last time because of the conflict,"" he said. ""Danger is ever-present in Gaza and my family are constantly moving to find safer places to take shelter."" Ehab said that even before the war it was not straightforward for players in Gaza to be allowed out to play. ""The President of the Palestinian Football Association negotiated tirelessly with the Israeli government, and with the intervention of FIFA the process had been eased slightly,"" Ehab said. Ibrahim described the process. ""We would leave our homes at 6am and gather at the Rafah crossing. Then we would wait in a hall on the Palestinian side for two to three hours until the paperwork was completed. Then we would pass over to the Egyptian side. ""We weren't allowed to enter Egypt, but escorted to the airport and kept in a room there until it was time for our flights. Very often, we spent two days travelling,"" he said. ""It was hard, but we didn't mind as we were so preoccupied with the game,"" he added. With thousands killed during the war, I asked Ehab why it is important for the Palestinian team continue to play football. ""In times like these, it is crucial for the Palestinian team to play. It showcases our resilience, "" he said. ""Football is not merely a game for us; it is a method through which we strive to achieve the dream of an officially recognised state for every Palestinian."" Ahmed has a similar message. ""Football is powerful way to demonstrate that the Palestinian people, despite the challenges they face, are human beings, that they have ambitions, dreams and talents.""

Yahya Sinwar: Who is the Hamas leader in Gaza?Published21 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Yahya Sinwar has disappeared. Hardly surprising when thousands of Israeli troops backed by drones, electronic eavesdropping devices and human informants, are all trying to discover his whereabouts. Sinwar, who has striking snow-white hair and jet-black eyebrows, is the leader of Hamas's political wing in Gaza, and one of Israel's most wanted men. It holds him responsible along with others for the 7 October raid into southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, and more than 200 others kidnapped. ""Yahya Sinwar is the commander… and he is a dead man,"" declared the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari in early October. ""This abominable attack was decided upon by Yahya Sinwar,"" said IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. ""Therefore he and all those under him are dead men walking."" That includes Mohammed Deif, the elusive leader of Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Hugh Lovatt, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), believes Deif was the brains behind the planning of the 7 October attack because it was a military operation, but Sinwar ""would likely have been part of the group that planned and influenced it"". Israel believes that Sinwar, who is effectively second-in-command after Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, is cornered below ground, hiding in tunnels somewhere beneath Gaza with his bodyguards, communicating with no-one for fear that his signal will be tracked and located. Sinwar, 61, widely known as Abu Ibrahim, was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp at the southern end of the Gaza Strip. His parents were from Ashkelon but became refugees after what Palestinians call ""al-Naqba"" (the Catastrophe) - the mass displacement of Palestinians from their ancestral homes in Palestine in the war that followed Israel's founding in 1948. He was educated at Khan Younis Secondary School for Boys and then graduated with a bachelor's degree in Arabic language from the Islamic University of Gaza. At that time, Khan Younis was a ""bastion"" of support for the Muslim Brotherhood, says Ehud Yaari, a fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who interviewed Sinwar in prison four times. The Islamist group ""was a massive movement for young people going to the mosques in the poverty of the refugee camp"", Yaari says, and it would later take on a similar importance for Hamas. Sinwar was first arrested by Israel in 1982, aged 19, for ""Islamic activities"" and then arrested again in 1985. It was around this time that he won the confidence of Hamas's founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. The two became ""very, very close"", says Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. This relationship with the organisation's spiritual leader would later give Sinwar a ""halo effect"" within the movement, Michael adds. Two years after Hamas was founded in 1987, he set up the group's feared internal security organisation, the al-Majd. He was still only 25. Al-Majd became infamous for punishing those accused of so-called morality offences - Michael says he targeted shops that stocked ""sex videos"" - as well as hunting down and killing anyone suspected of collaborating with Israel. Yaari says he was responsible for numerous ""brutal killings"" of people suspected of co-operation with Israel. ""Some of them with his own hands and he was proud of that, talking about it to me and to others."" According to Israeli officials, he later confessed to punishing a suspected informer by getting the man's brother to bury him alive, finishing the job using a spoon instead of a spade. ""He is the kind of man who can gather around him followers, fans - together with many who are simply afraid of him and don't want to pick any fights with him,"" Yaari says. In 1988, Sinwar allegedly planned the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers. He was arrested the same year, convicted by Israel for the murder of 12 Palestinians and given four life sentences. Sinwar has spent a large part of his adult life - over 22 years - in Israeli prisons, from 1988 to 2011. His time there, some of it in solitary confinement, appears to have radicalised him even further. ""He managed to impose his authority ruthlessly, using force,"" says Yaari. He positioned himself as a leader among the prisoners, negotiating on their behalf with prison authorities and enforcing discipline among the inmates. An Israeli government assessment of Sinwar during his time in prison described his character as ""cruel, authoritative, influential and with unusual abilities of endurance, cunning and manipulative, content with little... Keeps secrets even inside prison amongst other prisoners… Has the ability to carry crowds"". Yaari's assessment of Sinwar, built up over the times they met, was that he is a psychopath. ""[But] to say about Sinwar, 'Sinwar is a psychopath, full stop,' would be a mistake"" he says, ""because then you will miss this strange, complex figure"". He is, Yaari says, ""extremely cunning, shrewd - a guy who knows to switch on and off a type of personal charm"". When Sinwar would tell him Israel must be destroyed and insist there was no place for Jewish people in Palestine, ""he would joke, 'Maybe we'll make an exception of you'"". While incarcerated Sinwar had become fluent in Hebrew, reading Israeli newspapers. Yaari says Sinwar always preferred to speak Hebrew with him, even though Yaari was fluent in Arabic. ""He sought to improve his Hebrew,"" Yaari says. ""I think he wanted to benefit from somebody who spoke higher Hebrew than the prison wardens."" Sinwar was released in 2011 as part of a deal that saw 1,027 Palestinian and Israeli Arab prisoners released from jail in exchange for a single Israeli hostage, the IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. Shalit had been held captive for five years after being kidnapped by - amongst others - Sinwar's brother, who is a senior Hamas military commander. Sinwar has since called for more kidnappings of Israeli soldiers. By now, Israel had ended its occupation of the Gaza Strip and Hamas was in charge, having won an election and then eliminated its rivals, Yasser Arafat's Fatah party, by throwing many of its members off the tops of tall buildings. When Sinwar returned to Gaza, he was immediately accepted as a leader, Michael says. Much of this was to do with his prestige as a founding member of Hamas who had sacrificed so many years of his life in Israeli prisons. But also, ""people just feared him - this is a person that murdered people with his hands"", Michael says. ""He was very brutal, aggressive and charismatic at the very same time."" ""He's not an orator,"" says Yaari. ""When he speaks to the public, it's like somebody from the Mob."" Yaari adds that immediately after leaving prison, Sinwar also forged an alliance with the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades and chief of staff Marwan Issa. In 2013, he was elected a member of Hamas's Political Bureau in the Gaza Strip, before becoming its head in 2017. Sinwar's younger brother Mohammed also went on to play an active role in Hamas. He claimed to have survived several Israeli assassination attempts before being pronounced dead by Hamas in 2014. Media reports have since surfaced asserting he may still be alive, active in Hamas's military wing hiding in tunnels beneath Gaza and may even have played a part in the 7 October attacks. Sinwar's reputation for ruthlessness and violence earned him the nickname of The Butcher of Khan Younis. ""He's a guy who imposes brutal discipline,"" says Yaari, ""People knew in Hamas and they still do - if you disobey Sinwar, you put your life on the line."" He is reputed to have been responsible for the 2015 detention, torture and murder of a Hamas commander named Mahmoud Ishtiwi who was accused of embezzlement and homosexuality. In 2018, in a briefing to the international media, he signalled his support for thousands of Palestinians to break through the border fence separating the Gaza Strip from Israel as part of protests over the US moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Later that year he claimed to have survived an assassination attempt by Palestinians loyal to the rival Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank. Yet he has also shown periods of pragmatism, supporting temporary ceasefires with Israel, prisoner exchanges, and a reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority. He was even criticised by some opponents as too moderate, Michael says. Many in Israel's defence and security establishment believe it was a fatal mistake to have let Sinwar out of prison as part of the prisoner exchange. Israelis feel they were lulled into a false sense of security in the mistaken belief that by offering Hamas economic incentives and more work permits, the movement would have lost its appetite for war. This, of course, turned out to be a disastrous miscalculation. ""He sees himself as the guy destined to liberate Palestine - he's not about improving the economic situation, social services for Gaza,"" says Yaari. ""It's not him."" In 2015, the US State Department officially categorised Sinwar as a ""Specially Designated Global Terrorist"". In May 2021 Israeli airstrikes targeted his home and office in the Gaza Strip. In April 2022, in a televised address, he encouraged people to attack Israel by any available means. Analysts have identified him as a key figure linking Hamas's political bureau with its armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, which led the October 7th attacks in southern Israel. On 14 October, an Israeli military spokesman, Lt Col Richard Hecht, called Sinwar ""the face of evil"". He added: ""That man and his whole team are in our sights. We will get to that man."" Sinwar is also close to Iran. A partnership between a Shia country and a Sunni Arab organisation is not an obvious one, but both share a goal to end the state of Israel and ""liberate"" Jerusalem from Israeli occupation. They have come to work hand in hand. Iran funds, trains and arms Hamas, helping it to build up its military capabilities and amass an arsenal of thousands of rockets, which it uses to target Israeli towns. Sinwar expressed his gratitude for the support in a speech in 2021. ""Had it not been for Iran, the resistance in Palestine would not have possessed its current capabilities."" Yet killing Sinwar would be more of a ""PR victory"" for Israel than it would actually impact the movement, Lovatt says. Non-state organisations tend to operate like a hydra's head - one operational commander or figurehead leader gets removed and they are quickly replaced by another. Their successor sometimes lacks the same experience or credibility but the organisation still manages to regenerate itself in some form. ""Clearly, he would be a loss,"" says Lovatt, ""but he would be replaced and there are structures in place to do that. It's not like killing Bin Laden. There are other senior political and military leaders within Hamas."" Perhaps the bigger question remains this - what happens to Gaza when Israel ends its military campaign to eradicate Hamas, and who will ultimately be in charge? And can they prevent it from becoming once again a launchpad for attacks on Israel, triggering in return the kind of massive retribution and destruction we are seeing now.

Israeli tanks surround north Gaza's Indonesian HospitalPublished20 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli tanks have reportedly encircled Gaza's Indonesian Hospital, where the Hamas-run health ministry said 12 people were killed on Sunday night. The hospital's director, Dr Marwan Al-Sultan, told the BBC that the post-operative care department was hit and troops were only about 20m (66ft) away. On Monday evening, he said intermittent shooting could still be heard on site. The Israeli military said its forces targeted ""terrorists"" who had opened fire at them from within the hospital. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said he was ""appalled"". ""Health workers and civilians should never have to be exposed to such horror, and especially while inside a hospital,"" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra accused Israel of ""tightening its noose"" around the hospital in the north of the enclave, and later told AFP news agency 200 patients had been evacuated by bus to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. He said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was helping to coordinate the evacuation of the remaining 400 patients. Meanwhile, 28 premature Palestinian babies evacuated on Sunday from Gaza City's besieged Al-Shifa Hospital, which Israeli forces raided last week, have been transported to Egypt for treatment. Israel launched a major military campaign in Gaza in response to a cross-border attack by hundreds of Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's health ministry says more than 14,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel launched its retaliatory campaign against Hamas. The UN Security Council has called for ""urgent and extended humanitarian pauses"" for ""a sufficient number of days"" to allow UN agencies to safely enter the sealed-off territory. But five days on, the International Rescue Committee says the killing and suffering of Palestinians has increased, and has urged the Security Council and others to bring about a ceasefire ""without limits on its duration, to protect lives and allow aid to flow"". On Monday morning, video footage verified by the BBC showed several tanks stationed on a road about 240m (800ft) north-east of the Indonesian Hospital, which is funded by Indonesia. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, cited medical sources as saying thatdozens of Israeli armoured vehicles were in the surrounding area and that snipers were on rooftops, preventing ambulances from reaching the hospital. The health ministry said 12 wounded patients and people with them were killed and dozens more were wounded when an Israeli shell reportedly hit the second floor of the facility. Dr Al-Sultan told the BBC that he heard gunfire all around the building overnight and that at least 10 people were killed. Al Jazeera posted a video that the Qatar-based network said showed journalist Anas al-Sharif walking through the hospital following the incident. The body of at least one person could be seen, as well as damage to ceilings and equipment in several rooms and corridors. Sharif reported that ""victims are piling up on the floor""and that there was ""an overwhelming state of panic among patients"". Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""Overnight, terrorists opened fire from within the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza toward IDF troops operating outside the hospital. In response, IDF troops directly targeted the specific source of enemy fire. No shells were fired toward the hospital."" ""Despite the challenges the IDF faces in a war against a terrorist organisation which operates out of hospitals, the IDF is committed to international law and takes numerous measures to minimize harm to non-combatants."" Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden said he believed a deal to free hostages in Gaza was close, as the ICRC said its president had travelled to Qatar to meet with Hamas and Qatari government representatives. US national security spokesman John Kirby said he believed""we're closer than we've ever been, so we're hopeful"". The ICRC does not take part in negotiations leading to hostage releases but is there to facilitate any deal that is agreed. That has been the process with the four hostages freed so far - Qatari negotiations with Hamas followed by the ICRC retrieving the hostages from agreed locations and bringing them back to Israel. Qatar's prime minister has said a deal to free some of the hostages now hinges on ""minor"" practical issues. On Sunday night,the IDF released new videos from Al-Shifa Hospital, where it has claimed there was a vast underground Hamas command centre. It said one showed a tunnel leading to a blast-proof door and that two others taken from CCTV cameras showed two hostages - one of them wounded - being taken to the hospital on 7 October. The IDF also said a pathologist's report and its intelligence had shown a female Israeli soldier whose body was recovered from a building near Al-Shifa last week had been injured in an Israeli air strike and then killed by a member of Hamas inside the hospital. Hamas has denied using Al-Shifa and other hospitals as shields for its fighters. At the same time, the WHO has said it was finalising its plans to complete the evacuation of between 250 to 260 seriously wounded or ill patients trapped at Al-Shifa. ""These include around 29 patients with spinal injuries, 22 patients with kidney failure requiring kidney dialysis,"" the WHO's Regional Emergency Director, Dr Richard Brennan, told the BBC. ""The vast majority of the remaining patients have complicated war injuries - terrible fractures and amputations, bad burns, head, abdominal, chest injuries, and many of which are complicated by severe wound infection."" Thirty-one premature babies were evacuated from Al-Shifa to the Emirates Hospital in southern Gaza on Sunday by the Palestinian Red Crescent and UN, with the assistance of the IDF. At least five other babies had previously died after being removed from their incubators due to a lack of power after the hospital ran out of fuel. On Monday, 28 of the evacuated babies were taken to Egypt via the Rafah border crossing for treatment. Some are being admitted to the hospital in El-Arish while others in more serious conditions are being flown to Cairo. Dr Mohamed Salama, head of the neo-natal unit at al-Ahli Emirates hospital, told the BBC thatthe parents of two babies had refused to send them to Egypt ""due to personal circumstances"". A third baby was being kept in Gaza because his condition was stable and his parents were unknown, he said. Dr Brennan described the evacuation as ""one of the few bits of good news we've had during this conflict"", but noted that the babies had ""a long road ahead of them"" to recover. In a separate development, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said its clinic in Gaza City came under fire on Monday morning. ""Our colleagues saw that a wall was torn down and part of the building was engulfed by fire as heavy fighting took place all around it. An Israeli tank was seen in the street,"" a statement said. An MSF member of staff and 20 family members were in the clinic and in extreme danger, while 50 other people were in nearby buildings, it added. There was no immediate comment from the IDF.

US says Israel hostage deal 'closer than ever'Published20 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A deal to release hostages taken from Israel during Hamas's attacks last month is ""closer than ever before"", according to a senior US official. ""We're hopeful... but there's still work to be done,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. At a separate event, US President Joe Biden also said he believed an agreement was nearing. An estimated 240 people were kidnapped in the 7 October Hamas attacks, during which 1,200 Israelis were killed. Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said 13,000 people in Gaza have been killed in the territory in Israel's retaliatory campaign. Hints that a deal to secure the release of hostages may be nearing have been increasing in recent days - including from Qatar, which was instrumental in securing the release of four hostages last month. Now the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)'s president has travelled to Qatar - where hostage negotiations are being mediated and where the political leadership of Hamas is based. In a statement, the ICRC said its president, Mirjana Spoljaric, had travelled there in order to ""advance humanitarian issues"" related to the conflict. While the ICRC has stressed that it does not take part in direct negotiations leading to the release of hostages, it does help to facilitate releases once they have been agreed. So far, the group has facilitated the release of four hostages released by Hamas -a mother and daughter- who are US nationals - andtwo elderly Israeli women. ""As a neutral humanitarian intermediary, we remain ready to facilitate any future release that the parties to the conflict agree to,"" the ICRC said. On Sunday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said that only ""very minor"" practical and logistical obstacles remain in the way of securing a deal. The Israeli ambassador to the US - Michael Herzog - had also waded in, saying he was hopeful a deal for the release of a significant number of hostages would be reached ""in the coming days"". From talking to a figure familiar with the talks recently, the BBC understands that Israel and Hamas may be looking at some kind of phased release. This could include a small number of hostages being freed initially, alongside a ceasefire. If this holds, more people could be let go. Elsewhere, it has been suggested that part of the package could be the release of some Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, possibly women and minors. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far ruled out a halt to Israel's retaliatory attacks in Gaza, saying previously he would only consider a ceasefire when all hostages were released. Its operation, which involves air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops, aims to eliminate Hamas. More than 13,000 are thought to have died so far, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Last week Israel's military said it hadfound the bodies of two hostages- 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano - in the Gaza Strip. On Monday there were fraught interactions between the families of hostages and Israeli politicians. In one incident, several relatives of those held hostage in Gaza walked out of a meeting with the country's Prime Minister Netanyahu and other senior politicians after reportedly being told that securing the release was not the main priority. Udi Goren, whose cousin is among those who were kidnapped, told Israeli news organisation Channel 12 that relatives were now being told that the goal of freeing hostages was on par with destroying Hamas. ""It's a huge disappointment,"" he said. In another, which saw highly-charged scenes in the Knesset (Israel's parliament), relatives pleaded with far-right members of Israel's governing coalition not to introduce legislation to allow the use of the death penalty against Hamas, saying it could endanger hostages. Ultra-nationalist members of the knesset accused them of siding with Hamas by attempting to slow down the controversial bill. Gil Dickmann, whose aunt was killed by Hamas and whose two cousins are among the hostages, was among the relatives who took part in the confrontation. He told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme he thought the politicians had ""crossed a line"" with the allegation and accused far-right leader and government minister Itamar Ben-Gvir of ""doing whatever to spark more and more violence, more and more hate"". ""Our trust in the government was lost on 7 October,"" Mr Dickman said. ""And I think you can understand why. Our families or relatives were all hurt in a way that we couldn't imagine before. ""But I think that the bringing back of the kidnapped and abductees is the one thing that can bring back trust and bring back our belief in ourselves.""

Queen Camilla praises women journalists in war zonesPublished20 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsWar in Ukraine,"Queen Camilla has highlighted the threats to journalists who are ""risking their lives"" to cover conflicts such as those in Israel and Gaza, and Ukraine. In a speech to the Foreign Press Association in London, she spoke of the particular importance of female journalists in war zones. She stressed the need to report on sexual violence - a ""pervasive and all-too-often hidden feature of conflict"". And she warned of female journalists being ""targeted on social media"". Speaking in London, she said: ""As we gather, journalists, photographers and their support teams are even now risking their lives."" It follows reports of dozens ofjournalists dying during the current violencein Gaza and Israel. But the Queen also sent a strong message on the often under-reported issue of abuse and sexual violence against women in war zones. It was even more vital to cover such stories in an era when ""disinformation runs rife"", the Queen told her audience of international journalists. ""You have the ability to break the corrosive silence that frequently surrounds abuse. You bring into the open the voices of victims, you break taboos, you shine a light on these heinous crimes and you guide the public on what they can do to help,"" said the Queen. She praised the role of women journalists in war zones, ""who despite the many hurdles they have faced, have been among the bravest reporters of all"". She spoke of ""trailblazers"" like Martha Gellhorn, who reported during World War Two, and CNN's Christiane Amanpour, and she praised journalists who had ""paid with their lives"", such as Marie Colvin, who was killed in Syria, and Daphne Caruana Galizia in Malta. ""Their courage was matched only by their conviction that the truth matters,"" said the Queen. Since becoming Queen last year, Camilla has continued with her outspoken campaign to highlight the threat of violence against women and domestic abuse. Queen Camilla praised the efforts of the Foreign Press Association in providing training for women facing ""disruptive and abusive behaviour from members of the public"". She mentioned that the association, marking its 135th anniversary, was originally founded by overseas journalists who had travelled to London to cover a notorious case of violence against women, in the form of the Jack the Ripper murders. Journalism was vital to freedom of expression in a democratic system, she said. ""And I have even been the subject of one or two stories myself over the years...,"" said the Queen.",2023-11-20T21:21:57.000Z

Japan condemns Yemen's Houthi rebels hijack of cargo ship in Red SeaPublished20 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Japan has condemned the hijacking of a Japanese-operated, British-owned cargo ship in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The Yemeni militia claimed the vessel was Israeli, and a spokesman said the seizure was only the beginning of a ""battle at sea"". Israel said the ship was not Israeli and a Japanese government spokesperson said it was operated by Nippon Yusen. Japan's chief cabinet secretary said it was working towards the ship's release. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the Houthi's backer, Iran, for the hijacking. Mr Netanyahu said neither the vessel nor the crew were Israeli and called it an ""Iranian attack on an international ship"". Iran has denied involvement. Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen - also known as NYK Line - said the ship, named Galaxy Leader, was carrying 25 crew members when it was seized near Hodeida, Yemen on its way to India. Those on board are believed to include Bulgarian, Mexican, Filipino and Ukrainian nationals. Galaxy Leader is owned by Galaxy Maritime Ltd, which is registered in the Isle of Man. It is owned by Ray Car Carriers, which is co-owned by Israeli businessman Abraham Ungar, according to documents from the Isle of Man Government's Companies registry. In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, Galaxy Maritime Ltd said the ship was ""illegally boarded by military personnel via a helicopter"" on Sunday, and was now being held at the port of Hodeidah in Yemen. Unverified video footage released by the Houthis on Monday and aired on the group's TV channel, Al Masirah, showed armed men descending from a helicopter onto the ship. Mr Ungar told The Associated Press news agency he was aware of the incident but could not comment on it. ""The government of Japan absolutely condemns such an act,"" said Hirokazu Matsuno, Japan's chief cabinet secretary said on Monday, adding there were no Japanese nationals among the crew. He said ministries and agencies were working with the relevant countries for the early release of the vessel and its crew. ""We are also urging related countries such as Saudi Arabia, Oman and Iran to strongly urge the Houthis to release the ships and sailors as soon as possible."" Matthew Miller, spokesman for the US state department, called the Houthi's seizure of the ship ""a flagrant violation of international law"" and demanded the ""immediate release of the ship and its crew"". Mohammed Abdulsalam, a spokesman for Yemen's Houthi rebels, said on X, formerly Twitter, the group's seizure of the vessel was only ""the start"" of its fighters waging ""battle at sea"". Houthi's military spokesman, Yahya al-Sarea, claimed the ship was Israeli and had been taken to a port in Yemen. The group had earlier threatened to target any Israeli ship within their reach in response to Israel's retaliatory military action in the Gaza Strip following the 7 October attack by Hamas militants. More than 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage during the surprise Hamas attack on the south of the country, according to the Israeli government. In retaliation, it launched a massive military operation to try and eliminate Hamas - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 13,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble. The Houthis have fired several missiles and drones towards Israel just after Israel launched its retaliatory operation. The US said at the time that all the missiles and drones were intercepted by its warship in the Red Sea. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the attack on the ship as a ""very grave incident of global consequence"". The IDF said the vessel was on its way from Turkey to India when it was seized in the southern Red Sea near Yemen. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has recently said that what he called resistance groups allied to Tehran were ""cleverly adjusting pressure"" on Israel and its supporters. Earlier this month, the Houthis shot down a US military drone off Yemen's coast, American officials said. The Houthis have been locked ina prolonged civil warwith Yemen's official government - backed by Saudi Arabia - since 2014. Additional reporting by Shruti Menon",2023-11-20T20:20:23.000Z

First minister Humza Yousaf's mother-in-law describes Gaza 'nightmare'Published20 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The first minister's mother-in-law has described the ""living nightmare"" of being trapped in Gaza for four weeks during the Israel-Hamas war. Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged were visiting family when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. She admitted she felt she may die during their ordeal but that she had ""left my heart in Gaza"" when they were finally able to flee. The couple's daughter Nadia is married to Humza Yousaf. In aninterview with Beth Rigby for Sky News, Ms El-Nakla said: ""I [wake] up in the middle of the night and I hear silence in the dark and then I remember I'm home and that I'm safe. And I feel very grateful for that. ""You really do think every day or every night you will die, and the family that are under your roof as well. And that's hard to comprehend and hard to get over."" After two failed attempts, the couple - who live in Dundee - were eventually able to enter Egypt via the Rafah Border Crossing on 3 November. Ms El-Nakla said that was the moment she knew she was safe, but it was then when exhaustion hit. ""I hadn't slept for nearly three weeks and you're just so relieved but you still don't believe it and you're so exhausted. ""And it is such a relief, you can't imagine, but again your heart is torn. I left my heart in Gaza. I didn't bring it home with me."" Her daughter Nadia, who is a councillor in Dundee, said she had been ""holding onto hope"" but imagined that she may not see her parents again. When the conflict began on Saturday 7 October, Nadia messaged her parents and said: ""Your window is going to be small, you need to leave. It's going to become really, really a bad, dangerous situation for everyone in Gaza."" During their first attempt to flee to safety on 14 October, the couple were driven to the border by a neighbour. ""This is 15 minutes in a fast drive, 22 minutes on Google it tells you it takes. But to me, it could have been 15,000 miles it felt so far away,"" she said. They were told to turn back, and while on the phone to Nadia the line cut out following an explosion. Nadia said she ""fell to her knees"" and it took around 10 minutes for her to know her parents were still alive. Nadia said that was her lowest point. ""We then had to travel to Aberdeen because the [SNP] conference was about to start. So, I was crying the whole journey to Aberdeen. ""That for me was the worst - worst day in terms of my own mental health and dealing with it."" When the couple eventually crossed over into Egypt, Ms El-Nakla said she could see the ""desperation"" on the faces of those trying to flee. She said: ""I wouldn't wish that situation on my worst enemy."" Ms El-Nakla said she was getting stronger every day, but added: ""Unfortunately, until our family and people that we know and love and everyone in Gaza are safe, I don't think we will get over it and I think my life has changed forever."" The family are calling for a full ceasefire and a two-state solution.",2023-11-20T19:45:18.000Z

Israel says CCTV footage shows hostages were taken to Gaza hospitalPublished19 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israeli military has released footage which it says shows hostages being taken into Gaza's largest hospital after the deadly Hamas attacks of 7 October. A military spokesman said one of them - a soldier - was murdered there. Cpl Noa Marciano, 19, was killed after being taken into al-Shifa hospital with minor injuries, he said. Israel said a tunnel had been found at the site which it claims was a Hamas command centre. Hamas denies that. The BBC has not been able to verify the video which was presented at a news briefing by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday. ""This morning we updated Noa's family that according to our findings, she was kidnapped to a safe house near Shifa,"" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, IDF chief spokesperson told reporters. ""During IDF air strikes in the area, the Hamas terrorist who was holding Noa was killed and she was wounded in the air strike, but not a life-threatening injury. Noa was taken inside Shifa hospital, where she was murdered by another Hamas terrorist."" Hamas has previously claimed Ms Marciano was killed in an Israeli air strike, which the IDF said occurred on 9 November. Rear Adm Hagari then played CCTV footage which he said was from the morning of 7 October - the day Hamas launched its surprise attack on southern Israel in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 240 taken hostage. The video showed two hostages being brought into the hospital, Gaza's largest and most modern. Armed men can be seen in the CCTV video which is date-stamped 7 October. One of the hostages appears to be resisting - the other is shown on a stretcher. The IDF has been under pressure to substantiate its claim that Hamas operated an expansive command centre underneath the vast medical complex in the north of the territory. Responding to the video released by Israel, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said it was not able to confirm the authenticity of the footage. The ministry also said it was Israel which bore full responsibility for the deterioration and collapse of health services in Gaza. Earlier, the IDF released a video that it said showed a tunnel 10m (33ft) below ground that runs for 55m up to a closed and reinforced door. It said this was now part of the evidence that ""clearly proves"" numerous buildings in the hospital's complex have been ""used by Hamas as cover for terrorist infrastructure and activities"". The latest video is not yet the evidence that's been promised of the sort of vast and intricate operation depicted in a computer simulation which the IDF previously released showing what it believes any Hamas base underground at al-Shifa could look like. The US has said it also has intelligence that Hamas has used hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including al-Shifa, as command centres and weapons stores. Israel has cited US intelligence to substantiate their claim of the existence of a major headquarters at the complex but the Americans' use of the term ""node"" may suggest a smaller operation. Israel believes it is building a credible case and is keen to present evidence as and when it finds it. While Israel's allies have supported its military campaign of retaliation, which it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, they have expressed a lot of unease at the toll that the offensive is having on civilians. The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 people are feared to be buried under rubble. The government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also under pressure from families of the hostages. They want him to do more to free those held by Hamas. On Saturday, protesters calling on the Israeli government to prioritise securing the release of hostages walked from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem before holding a demonstration outside Mr Netanyahu's residence. The prime minister, however, appears undeterred in his mission. He says his first goal of the war is to destroy Hamas; the second to return the hostages; and the third to eliminate the threat from Gaza.",2023-11-19T22:22:40.000Z

Yemen's Houthi rebels hijack cargo ship in Red SeaPublished19 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels say they have seized an Israeli cargo ship in the Red Sea. They said the vessel was then taken to a port in Yemen. Israel said the ship was not Israeli, and no Israelis were among its crew. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said this was ""another act of Iranian terrorism"". Iran has not commented. Houthis had threatened to hijack Israeli ship within their reach over Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel says 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage during the surprise Hamas attack on the south of the country on 7 October. Israel has launched a massive military operation - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble. The Houthis have fired several missiles and drones towards Israel just after Israel launched its retaliatory operation. The US said at the time that all the missiles and drones were intercepted by its warship in the Red Sea. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the attack on the ship - which it did not name - as a ""very grave incident of global consequence"". The IDF said the vessel was on its way from Turkey to India when it was seized in the southern Red Sea near Yemen. Although Israel says the seized vessel does not have any connection with it, unconfirmed reports suggest the ship may have an Israeli owner. In Sunday's statement on social media, Mr Netanyahu said that Israel ""strongly condemns the Iranian attack against an international vessel"". He said the ship was owned by ""a British company and is operated by a Japanese firm"", adding that ""25 crew members of various nationalities including Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Filipino and Mexican"" were on board the ship. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has recently said that what he called resistance groups allied to Tehran were ""cleverly adjusting pressure"" on Israel and its supporters. Earlier this month, the Houthis shot down a US military drone off Yemen's coast, American officials said. The Houthis have been locked ina prolonged civil warwith Yemen's official government - backed by Saudi Arabia - since 2014.",2023-11-19T18:19:53.000Z

Gaza war: Premature babies evacuated from al-Shifa hospitalPublished19 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Thirty-one premature Palestinian babies have been evacuated from Gaza City's al-Shifa hospital, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has described as a ""death zone"". The babies have been taken to an Emirati hospital in the southern city of Rafah, close to the Egyptian border. Hundreds of people, including patients, left from al-Shifa on Saturday. The hospital - the territory's largest and most modern - is under the control of Israeli troops. They have been searching the complex for evidence that it served as headquarters of Hamas. On Saturday, hundreds of people, including some patients, evacuated the hospital, but some 300 critically ill people remained as well as 33 premature babies. A Red Crescent spokeswoman told the BBC that one baby then died on Friday evening and another on Saturday morning. On Sunday the 31 surviving babies were evacuated by the Red Crescent in coordination with the UN. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the babies were ""very sick"", had been moved under ""extremely intense and high-risk security conditions"", and were now ""receiving urgent care in the neonatal intensive care unit"" in Rafah. Dr Mohammad Zaqout, general director of hospitals in the Gaza Strip, told AP some of the babies were dehydrated or had developed gastritis due to unsanitised water. Lack of medications had caused others to develop sepsis, and some had hypothermia as they could not be placed in incubators. The babies had been accompanied by six health workers and 10 staff family members, Dr Tedros said. Doctors at al-Shifa had previously said newborns had died after power for incubators was cut off due to a lack of fuel. Red Crescent spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told the BBC that some of the premature babies' parents had been killed in Israeli air strikes. The BBC is not able to independently verify this. She said the surviving parents had been ordered to leave Gaza City - where al-Shifa hospital is located - before the babies' evacuation, and their current whereabouts were unknown. A Gaza health ministry Facebook page urged the babies' parents to rejoin their babies at the hospital in Rafah. Israel has not yet commented, though it previously said it would help evacuate babies to a ""safer hospital"". The WHO was planning further missions to take the remaining patients and staff out of al-Shifa once safe passage guarantees had been secured, he said. Al-Shifa's hospital director Dr Muhammad Abu Salima has called on the WHO and the UN to help the medical teams and patients ""leave this desolated place"". He told BBC Arabic there were about 25 medical staff left at the hospital, but that without water and electricity they were unable to properly care for the hundreds of remaining patients. ""The hospital, now, is a ghost house in the full sense of the word,"" he said. ""Corpses are spreading out in the emergency department, patients are screaming, the medical staff is quite helpless, while the army is walking freely around in the hospital,"" he said. Israel has said Hamas has a command centre under al-Shifa - a claim Hamas has denied - but has not yet provided substantial evidence of this. Later on Sunday the Israeli military released footage which it said showed a ""55m-long terror tunnel, 10m deep underneath the Shifa hospital"". The footage shows a tunnel leading to a door. The IDF said investigations were ""continuing to uncover the route of the tunnel"". Earlier this week, Israel military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, said it couldtake weeksto fully search the medical complex. Hamas, classified as a terrorist organisation in many Western countries, attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostage. Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.",2023-11-19T18:04:48.000Z

Israel hopeful of Hamas deal to release hostages in 'coming days'Published19 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israeli ambassador to the US says he is hopeful a deal for the release of a significant number of hostages will be reached ""in the coming days"". Michael Herzog told ABC ""serious efforts"" were being made, but that the fewer details he revealed, ""the better the chances of such a deal"". Hamas took an estimated 240 people hostage during their 7 October attacks which killed 1,200 Israelis. Qatar, which has been mediating, also says a deal is within reach. The Washington Post newspaper has reported that Israel and Hamas are ""close to agreement on a US-brokered deal that would free dozens of women and children held hostage in Gaza in exchange for a five-day pause in fighting"", citing ""people familiar with the emerging terms"". Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said on Sunday that only ""very minor"" practical and logistical obstacles remain, adding that ""we are close enough to reach a deal"". The US has not confirmed any details of progress. White House National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson posted on X: ""We have not reached a deal yet, but we continue to work hard to get to a deal."" And Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out a full ceasefire. Qatar has been playing a leading role in mediation efforts to secure the release of hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. It was involved in the negotiations that have seen four people freed so far -a mother and daughter, who are US nationals, andtwo elderly Israeli women. The small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state is home to the political leadership of Hamas, which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. On Saturday, protesters calling on the Israeli government to prioritise securing the release of hostages walked from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem before holding a demonstration outside Mr Netanyahu's residence. Mr Netanyahu has been criticised for not doing more to free those held by Hamas. In a press conference on Saturday night, he said the first goal of the war was to destroy Hamas, the second was to return the hostages and the third was to eliminate the threat from Gaza. ""We want answers,"" said protester Ari Levi, who had two family members - including his 12-year-old son - taken by Hamas from kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October. ""It's not normal to have children kidnapped for 43 days. We don't know what the government is doing, we don't have any information,"" Mr Levi told the AFP news agency. ""I want the government to bring them home to us,"" said Dvora Cohen, 43, whose brother-in-law and 12-year-old nephew are both believed to be held by Hamas. This week Israel's military said it hadfound the bodies of two hostages- 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano - in the Gaza Strip. Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.",2023-11-19T16:48:28.000Z

Inside the West Bank district under harsh Israeli lockdown since Hamas attackPublished19 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Fawaz Qafisha cracked his front door open a few inches, stuck his head through the gap and squinted against the sun. The street outside was almost completely dead, save for an Israeli soldier who was sitting on a garden chair placed opposite Qafisha's house, facing the front door. Before Qafisha had even adjusted his eyes to the light and spotted us coming down the road towards him, the Israeli soldier had sprung to his feet, raised his rifle halfway and ordered Qafisha back inside. The falafel cook, aged 52, gestured for us to hurry. ""This is how it is any time we try to open the door now,"" he said, as we entered. ""We are not even allowed to stand at our windows."" Qafisha, who was born and raised in Hebron, in the occupied West Bank, is a resident of H2, a dense and heavily fortified district that is home to 39,000 Palestinians and roughly 900 Israeli settlers considered some of the most extreme in the occupied territory. The Palestinians and Israelis of H2 are separated in some places here by just a few feet, and surrounded by cameras, cages, checkpoints, concrete blast walls and rolls of razor wire. For more than 40 days now, since the Hamas attack on Israel, 11 Palestinian neighbourhoods within H2 - comprising about 750 families - have been under one of the harshest lockdowns imposed on the area for more than 20 years. H2's population is almost entirely Palestinian, but the district is under the total control of the Israeli military, which has for the past few weeks been forcing Palestinian residents back inside their homes at gunpoint. Qafisha and his family of nine had barely left the house, he said. He did not want to take any risks. ""You saw what happened when you arrived,"" he said. ""We have a door we cannot open and windows we cannot look out from. We do not have any freedom. We are living in fear."" Qafisha's house sat just off Shuhada Street, once one of the busiest Palestinian market streets in Hebron. In 1994, a massacre of 29 Muslims by a Jewish extremist at a nearby mosque led to riots, which in turn prompted a crackdown by the Israeli army. The army forcibly closed Palestinian businesses and then welded shut the front doors of the Palestinian residents, on the Shuhada Street side. Since then, the Palestinians of the area around Shuhada Street have lived through shifting restrictions on where they can go, when, and how. Flare-ups in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have often led to some form of lockdown, but several residents told the BBC that this was the harshest they had ever experienced. A few hundred feet up the road from Qafisha's house, Zleekhah Mohtaseb, a 61-year-old former tour guide and translator, was staring down from her rooftop, watching a young Israeli settler shouting to himself as he meandered slowly down Shuhada Street. Mohtaseb had had spent all her six decades within a stone's throw of where she stood now, she said. Directly across Shuhada street, no more than 20 feet away, was Hebron Cemetery, where 10 generations of her family were buried. Once upon a time, she could walk straight across the street and into the cemetery. Now it took her an hour by car. ""The settlers,"" she said, shaking her head, as the young Israeli walked past her welded-shut front door. ""They can do what they want. They are the chosen people."" Mohtaseb had seen a lot in her lifetime in Hebron, but the past 40 days had been among the most tense, she said. Hours after Hamas attacked Israel, in a murderous rampage that left an estimated 1,200 Israelis dead, Palestinian residents of H2 received messages from the Israeli military telling them that they were no longer allowed to leave their homes. Israeli soldiers began forcing people off the streets at gunpoint, including Mohtaseb. ""Those first two weeks were hell,"" she said. Two weeks after it began, the curfew in H2 relented slightly, allowing the Palestinians to leave their homes for certain hours on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Then this past Thursday, as Mohtaseb was preparing to meet us, three Palestinian militants from Hebron attacked an Israeli checkpoint dividing the West Bank from Jerusalem, killing one soldier and wounding five. Immediately, she knew that the attack would prolong and intensify the crackdown in H2. ""Everyone says that Israel has the right to defend herself. Fine. We are not against it. But what about us, the Palestinians?"" she said. ""Many times we were attacked, many times we were killed, many times we were forced from our homes. Where was this right to defend when the Palestinians were attacked?"" H2 began life in 1997 when Hebron was divided into two sectors, under an agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel. H1, populated entirely by Palestinians and controlled by the Palestinian Authority, accounts for roughly 80% of the city. H2, which accounts for just 20% of the city, is populated almost entirely by Palestinians but controlled by the Israeli military. Within H2, the area around Shuhada Street and the Ibrahimi Mosque is the most fortified by checkpoints and guard posts. It has seen decades of tension, violence, and terror attacks from both sides. ""This is the closed place inside the closed place,"" said Muhammad Mohtaseb, a 30-year-old hospital security guard, sitting on the roof of his house opposite the mosque. ""We are completely surrounded by checkpoints,"" he said. ""Even on a good day, I cannot drive a car, no car can come in with Palestinian number plates. If I want to bring something to my house, I have to carry it half a kilometre from the checkpoint. When I got married, I bought all new furniture for my bedroom, but I had to take it all apart into pieces on the other side of the checkpoint to get it through the turnstiles, then rebuild it on this side."" That was a good day. Since 7 October, the freedom even to move around in the street was gone. When we arrived at Mohtaseb's home, just like at the home of Fawaz Qafisha, a soldier sprang towards the door and ordered Mohtaseb back inside. Up on the roof, Mohtaseb rolled a cigarette and looked out over the empty streets. With three of his four children out of school - the H2 schools have all been closed - Mohtaseb had been at home and away from work for 40 days. Fortunately for him, his employer had been understanding and was still paying him. This was not the case for everyone. Qafisha, the falafel cook, had been unable to fulfil his work responsibilities since the lockdown began, because he could only go out three days a week, and on those three days the allotted hours did not match the hours he would need to travel for work anyway. And unlike Mohtaseb's employer, his had not been understanding. ""In these jobs, if you work you eat,"" he said. ""And if you don't work you don't eat."" Qafisha had borrowed money several times from friends, to buy food for the family, but he was running out of options. ""Anything that you spend you cannot replace,"" he said, sitting in his living room, away from the window. ""So we are sinking."" The following morning, there was another armed attack on Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian militant, this one in Hebron itself. This time it resulted in only the attacker's death. But a few hours later, another message was sent out via WhatsApp from the Israeli military to the Palestinian residents of Shuhada Street. ""A notification for the residents of Shuhada Street,"" it said. ""You are forbidden to be in the streets for one week."" And if they left H2, it said, they would not be allowed to re-enter until the week had passed. The lockdown in H2 was a ""blatant example of how Israel is implementing collective punishment in the West Bank"", said Dror Sadot, a spokeswoman for the Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem. ""The Palestinians in Hebron are paying a price for something they didn't do,"" she said. ""People cannot go to work, children cannot go to school, they are having trouble getting water and food. It is collective punishment, and it is illegal under international law."" The Israeli military told the BBC in a statement that its forces operate in the West Bank ""in accordance with the situational assessment in order to provide security to all residents of the area."" ""Accordingly, there are dynamic checkpoints and efforts to monitor movement in different areas in Hebron,"" it said. Among the Israeli settlers living in H2, in the hardline Kiryat Arba settlement, is Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir. On Thursday, Ben Gvir, who has personally overseen the distribution of thousands of new rifles to West Bank settlers since October 7th, said that Israel should take the same approach to the occupied territory that it was taking in Gaza, where more than 11,000 Palestinians have now been killed. ""Containment will blow up in our faces,"" Ben Gvir said, of the West Bank. ""Just like it did in Gaza."" According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since 7 October, by settlers or in clashes with the military. On Wednesday, just a few hundred metres from Ben Gvir's house, Areej Jabari had gathered a small group of women into a knitting circle in her home in H2, in defiance of the Israeli orders not to move in the streets that day. This was only the second successful gathering since the lockdown began, and there were only eight women present, down from around 50 who usually gather once a week at the mosque. The knitters had got there by sleight. ""We sneak through the side roads and between the buildings,"" said Huda Jabari, Areej's younger cousin, with a grin. The women have learned, this long into the lockdown, to observe the Israeli soldiers and move when they are not looking. They use one another's houses to avoid checkpoints within H2, entering the front door in one sector and emerging from the back door into another. ""In normal times, 50 families pass through my house to get around,"" said Areej's mother Sameera, whose own house sat in the shadow of Ben Gvir's. Areej took us up to her roof to show us her view, over an Israeli military base and guard post close to her house. Below us, Israeli settlers passed by along her street, which she was no longer allowed to use. Since 7 October, Areej had been coming up here to the roof with her video camera to gather footage of the soldiers and send it to B'Tselem, the human rights organisation. In return, the Israeli military arrived at her house last Saturday and forced their way in, she said. ""They broke my press card and warned me not to take any more video or post anything on social media."" They also forbade her to go up onto her roof, she said, or look out of her windows on Fridays or Saturdays, when the Israeli settlers use her road to walk from the settlement to the Jewish holy site near Shuhada Street. The IDF told the BBC that it was aware of the incident Areej described and was following up with the specific soldiers involved to examine what happened. ""We are taking this incident very seriously,"" a spokesperson said. To Areej, it did not feel particularly out of the ordinary. ""Any time something happens they put more restrictions on us,"" she said. ""The goal is to divide us, to split the area into small pieces and to pressure us to leave."" She was standing up against the railing around the roof of her home, looking out over H2. ""I call this area the fortress of steadfastness,"" she said. She opened her video camera and pointed it in the direction of the Israeli guard post down the road. Muath al-Khatib contributed to this report. Photographs by Joel Gunter",2023-11-19T14:10:26.000Z

"Israel-Gaza: Protests against MPs cross a line, says Rachel ReevesPublished19 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Some of the protests targeting MPs over the Israel-Gaza war are ""crossing the line"" into intimidation, the shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has said. She made the comments after a demonstration was held in north London on Saturdayclose to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's constituency office. Ms Reeves called for ""civility and decency"" when discussing the conflict. Labour MPs were this week told not to vote for an SNP amendment calling for an immediate ceasefire. On Wednesday,10 Labour frontbenchers resigned from their jobsto defy Sir Keir and back the amendment. In total, 56 of the MPs voted with the SNP position. It differed from the Labour Party's, which is to call for ""humanitarian pauses"" in order to allow more aid into the enclave while backing Israel's right to self-defence. Ms Reeves called for the targeting of public figures by protesters to stop, telling the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: ""What I find very concerning is the huge pressure that MPs have been put [under] leading up to the vote and this week. ""I support the right to protest - Suella Braverman'scomments about these being 'hate marches'are appalling. ""But I don't support the intimidation of MPs and I think that's what you are seeing with some of these protests now, outside of people's offices and outside of people's homes. ""MPs have got a difficult job to do - all public servants do - and this sort of intimidation, taking protests to people's homes, goes beyond the line."" Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters descended on Sir Keir's north London office on Saturday, chanting ""Starmer, shame on you"". Shadow Welsh secretary Jo Stevenshad her Cardiff constituency office vandalisedafter abstaining on the Gaza vote, and told BBC Wales the experience was ""intimidating"" and ""threatening"". Bradford West MP Naz Shah - who quit the Labour frontbench to support a ceasefire - said she has received ""Islamophobic hatred"", while Conservative ministerMichael Gove needed a police escortafter he was surrounded by pro-Palestinian protesters at a London train station last weekend. Ms Reeves said she had not personally been targeted but said it had happened ""to colleagues"" without providing specific examples, adding: ""I'm afraid that some of these protests are now crossing the line."" Asked about the Labour rebellion over the ceasefire motion, Ms Reeves said she was ""sorry"" to see resignations. She added: ""But being leader - and hopefully next year, prime minister - Keir is going to make incredibly difficult decisions, and he's going to have to do what he thinks is right, and offer that leadership, even in difficult times."" Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he had not seen examples of antisemitism on pro-Palestinian marches he has attended, but said he would challenge it if he did. He told the BBC: ""It bothers me those chants, but they're so small a minority we've got the powers to deal with that."" Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages. Israel responded with air strikes on Gaza and has launched a ground offensive. More than 12,300 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",2023-11-19T12:22:36.000Z

"WHO says Gaza's al-Shifa hospital a death zone, as hundreds leavePublished19 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The World Health Organization (WHO) has described al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City as a ""death zone"". A joint UN team led by the WHO assessed the hospital for one hour following its occupation by the Israeli military and as some patients and those seeking shelter there began to evacuate it. The team said they saw evidence of shelling and gunfire and observed a mass grave at the hospital's entrance. They were told it held the remains of 80 people. Following an evacuation which the hospital director said was ordered by the Israeli army but which the army said was requested by the director, 300 critically ill patients remain in al-Shifa - formerly the largest and most advanced hospital in Gaza. The WHO said it was trying to arrange the urgent evacuation of remaining patients and staff to other facilities in Gaza, and repeated calls for a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the White House has responded to areport in the Washington Postwhich said Israel, Hamas and the US were on the verge of a deal that would see the release of women and children seized by Hamas on 7 October in exchange for a five-day pause in fighting. A White House spokesperson said no such deal had yet been reached but it was working hard to get one agreed. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has ruled out a full ceasefire with Hamas and said he will consider only a temporary truce in exchange for the return of hostages kidnapped by the group. Hundreds of people, including some patients, left al-Shifa on Saturday. A journalist at al-Shifa hospital told the BBC that only ""patients who could not move and a very small number of doctors"" remained behind. ""We raised our hands and carried white flags,"" Khader, a journalist who had been at al-Shifa, told the BBC. The IDF denied ordering the evacuation of al-Shifa and said it had agreed to a request from the hospital's director for those wanting to leave to evacuate through a ""secure route"". ""At no point did the IDF order the evacuation of patients or medical teams and in fact proposed that any request for medical evacuation will be facilitated by the IDF,"" a statement said. Dr Ramez Radwan, a doctor who said he was ordered to leave al-Shifa by Israeli authorities, described the situation at the hospital as ""miserable"", saying there were no painkillers or antibiotics and some patients had ""worms coming out of the wounds"". Israel's military has raided the hospital in recent days, as part of what it describes as a ""targeted operation against Hamas"", but is yet to provide substantial evidence that the group conducted a major operation in tunnels underneath the medical complex. Separately, Hamas health officials said two explosions in Jabalia in northern Gaza together killed 80 people. Israel told the BBC it could not confirm it struck a UN school-turned-shelter but was investigating. BBC Verify has geolocated footage to al-Fakhoura school in Jabalia that shows many people - including women and children - with severe injuries or lying motionless on the floor in different parts of the building. There are more than 20 such casualties visible in the footage, and around half of these are seen in one particular room on the ground floor, which also shows signs of considerable damage. The head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said he had seen ""horrifying images and footage of scores of people killed and injured"" in one of his agency's schools ""sheltering thousands of displaced"". ""These attacks cannot become commonplace, they must stop,"" he said. Elsewhere, the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 30 people from the same family had been killed elsewhere in Jabalia, in what it also said was an Israeli strike. The IDF had no immediate comment on the report but said it was expanding operations in Gaza, including in Jabalia, to target Hamas. It has told Palestinians in northern Gaza to leave for their own safety and has now begun telling people in the southern city of Khan Younis, where many thousands of people who have fled northern Gaza are, thatthey must now also leave. Israel says the aim is to wipe out Hamas, following its attack on Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage. The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.",2023-11-19T06:30:34.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: Glasgow protesters march for immediate ceasefirePublished18 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Thousands of people have attended a pro-Palestinian rally in Glasgow to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Demonstrators gathered in the east end of the city at Glasgow Green. Protesters have held demonstrations in cities and towns across Scotland every weekend since hostilities began in the Middle East last month. Next week, the Scottish government will lead a debate in Holyrood on the situation after MPs in Westminster voted against a ceasefire. The SNP tabled the motion on Wednesday which was defeated by 125 votes to 294. First Minister Humza Yousaf has been vocal in his support for a ceasefire and said he was ""beyond angry"" with MPs who refused to back an immediate end to the fighting. Mr Yousaf, who was recently reunited with his Palestinian in-laws after they returned to Scotland after being trapped for four weeks in Gaza, warned MPs who did not back an immediate ceasefire were ""on the wrong side of history"". Rabbi Pete Tobias told BBC Scotland News he would love to join a rally like the one in Glasgow, if he thought it was ""genuinely"" seeking to bring peace to the Middle East. ""But I believe that the framing of these marches as 'pro-Palestinian' and the nature of the banners and chants we see and hear makes them partisan, confrontational and frankly dangerous,"" he said. Organisers estimated that around 18,000 people turned out for the pro-Palestinian event in Glasgow, arranged by a coalition of groups called the Gaza Genocide Emergency Committee. There was also a Jewish bloc in attendance at the protest. Nadia Boukdir was one of the many people who came out to show their support for Palestinians, despite the rain. The university student, who is originally from Morocco, is studying for her masters at Strathclyde. She told BBC Scotland News it had been ""very tough"" seeing the footage coming out of Gaza. ""We're trying our best to just speak and not stay quiet because our friends, our sisters, our brothers are dying, children are dying and families are being destroyed,"" she said. Anna, a medical student from Edinburgh who is part of a group called medics for humanitarian justice, was also at the protest. She said she came out to show solidarity with her colleagues in Gaza. Those attending the rally had been urged to write their names on their arms as a gesture of solidarity with the besieged population of Gaza, who have used the method so they can be identified and buried with relatives if they are killed. ""Our government's response has been abysmal and we're demanding that they call for a ceasefire now to protect our colleagues and their patients in Gaza,"" Anna said. ""They have been consistently attacking healthcare facilities, hospitals, people accessing aid, people distributing aid. This is beyond a war. This is a genocide and we want it stopped."" On Friday, Israel's prime minister said Israel was trying to minimise civilian casualties but had been ""not successful"", which he blamed on Hamas. In an interview with CBS News, Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was firing at Palestinians trying to get safety. More than 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza, Hamas's health ministry says, since Israel went to war after Hamas's attack on 7 October. Sammy Stein, who chairs Glasgow Friends of Israel, said his group advocated for peace and supported both the Palestinian and Israeli people. ""We advocate for both people to have their own homeland, which is quite unusual because nobody else, certainly on this street and around the UK that advocates for both sides,"" he said. ""They tend to be either pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian. We believe that you cannot have peace for one side and therefore if you want peace you need to have peace for both sides."" Mr Stein said he thinks many of the people who have attend the demonstrations in Glasgow over the last few weeks have been genuine in their pursuit of peace. ""But many of them do not understand the complications of the conflict,"" he said. ""Now it's all very well for people to walk up and down with banners saying ceasefire unfortunately we know from what Hamas has said that they are not prepared to stop."" He added that he thought there was no point calling for a ceasefire if ""you know that one side is not going to honour that ceasefire"". But that has not stopped similar protests taking place across the UK demanding an end to the fighting, with one in Aberdeen andanother in Oxford. On Friday, hundreds joined a school strike for the Palestinian cause, with rallies held in Glasgow, London and Bristol as part of a number of school walkouts organised by the campaign group Stop the War Coalition. Scottish Greens councillor Blair Anderson said on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, that there would be ""no punitive action"" for any of the Glasgow schoolchildren who attended the rally. A number of pro-Palestinian marches were also held across Scotland on Armistice Day last weekend.",2023-11-18T18:17:22.000Z

Pro-Palestinian rallies held in Manchester and LiverpoolPublished18 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Thousands of people have marched in Manchester and Liverpool calling for an end to Israel's attacks in Gaza. Protesters carried a banner describing the UK government as ""complicit in genocide"" after 293 MPs voted against a call for a ceasefire. Rallies have been held since war began on 7 October, after Hamas killed 1,200 people and captured more than 200 hostages in Israel. Since then, more than 12,000 people are reported to have been killed in Gaza. Demonstrators repeated calls for a ceasefire and an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. The Conservative government, along with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, has called instead for ""humanitarian pauses"" which will allow safe passage of aid into Gaza. On Wednesday,56 Labour MPs rebelled against Sir Keir's stancein Parliament when they voted to call for an immediate ceasefire. Eight of his frontbench team - including Greater Manchester MPs Afzal Khan and Yasmin Qureshi - resigned from their roles. Robert Lizar, from Jewish Voice For Labour, told the BBC he hoped ""all the MPs will listen again and change their minds and vote for ceasefire now"". ""This is a humanitarian disaster and all the MPs should be demanding that our allies, particularly in Washington, tell Israel they've got to stop, there has to be a ceasefire. ""Let's release the hostages, release the prisoners in Israel and we have to make moves towards peace."" He said there had been ""difficult conversations [within the Jewish community] because I think quite a lot, but not all, Jewish people feel an emotional attachment to Israel and they feel that's part of their identity"". However he added ""a lot of Jewish people are highly critical of what Israel has been doing so we represent that voice"". One man told the BBC he was attending the Manchester protest for ""humanitarian reasons"", adding: ""We cannot stand and watch what's happening."" A large number of police officers were present, with the marches appearing to be peaceful, according to BBC crews covering the protests. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,XandInstagram?

Crowds blocked a road in Camden and chanted ""Keir Starmer's a wasteman"". It comes as groups held sit-in protests at several train stations across London. The demonstrations were part of a day of national action organised by the Stop the War Coalition throughout the UK. Protesters met outside Chalk Farm station before heading through Camden to Sir Keir's constituency office. Once there, protesters held up signs with slogans such as ""Stop the war on Gaza"", ""Starmer shame on you"" and ""Starmer, human rights lawyer? What a joke"". It comes after a vote in the House of Commons calling for a ceasefire in Gaza which saw56 Labour MPs defy the party lineto vote in favour of the motion. At the event on Saturday, John Rees, national officer for the Stop the War Coalition, told crowds: ""You saw what this movement did to Suella Braverman. ""Unless you get yourselves in line with the majority of people in this country who want an immediate ceasefire, this movement will do that to you Rishi Sunak, it will do that to you, Keir Starmer."" The crowds also heard from 33-year-old Palestinian Nida Badawi. She told crowds: ""For the past 40 days, over 40 days, I feel like my heart's been ripped out of my body. ""I'm just here to remind you while we're standing here, it's not the time to stay quiet. They need to hear our voices."" Meanwhile sit-in demonstrations took place at various London railway stations, where British Transport Police (BTP) issued Section 14a orders prohibiting protests between 10:00 and 23:00. Roughly 200 protesters arrived at London Bridge station at about 14:30 GMT and a police cordon was put in place around the station, but BTP later posted on X, formerly Twitter, to say the group had left the area and passengers could access the station as usual. At Waterloo station, a group of about 100 pro-Palestinian protesters sat down on the concourse demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. BTP said: ""Following engagement with protest liaison officers, protestors are refusing to leave Waterloo station as agreed. Therefore we are moving to arrest phase."" Protesters were removed from the station by officers, with at least two demonstrators carried from the scene.

Palestine protesters call for Selly Oak Labour MP to be deselectedPublished18 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Palestine supporters group has gathered outside its local MP's office calling for his deselection. Protesters gathered at Selly Oak Labour MP Steve McCabe's office after he did not vote for a ceasefire in Gaza. Police said campaigners also entered the Bullring in Birmingham but the protest remained peaceful. Steve McCabe, who chairs Labour Friends of Israel, said he ""sees himself as a friend of Palestinian people"". ""I have worked non-stop since I became the chair to advocate for a two-state solution and for an international peace and reconciliation fund to help us get there,"" Mr McCabe said. One protester who is originally from Gaza said communications with relatives cut off a week ago. ""You worry so much all the time and there are killings every day. ""You don't know if you'll wake up in the morning and hear that everybody's gone,"" he said. Protester Farhat said: ""Every single action we take makes a difference... we can get together and share our frustration and our anger and our grief about what is happening."" Ten Labour frontbenchers, including Jess Phillips, quit tovote for an SNP motionin the Commons backing a ceasefire, in defiance of Sir Keir Starmer's instructions. Mr McCabe said: ""I don't honestly believe we are going to get a ceasefire at the moment, if the entire House of Commons called for it I don't think that'll make Hamas or the Israel Defence Forces stop fighting. ""I think we have to work towards a permanent end to this and I'd like to see an enduring peace and proper peace talks after it so not only does it stop but it doesn't start again."" When asked what he thought of the protests outside his office, Mr McCabe told the BBC he worried for the people, some of which are vulnerable, who may have to walk by the protest to get into the MP's advice centre. ""It's pretty difficult when you have to walk through that sort of thing just to see your MP,"" Mr McCabe said. On 7 October,Hamas gunmen launched an assaulton Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in Manzil Way, Cowley, and marched to Bonn Square in the centre of the city. Organisers say the Palestinian people desperately need humanitarian aid. Rabiah Abbasi, from Muslim-based youth group Help The World Oxford, said she wanted local politicians to ""see that the people of Oxford demand a ceasefire and an end to this genocide"". She said the people of Gaza deserved to ""wake up to the sound of birds and not bombing"". Kendall Gardner, a Jewish DPhil student at the University of Oxford, said: ""The humanitarian situation in Gaza is an absolute atrocity. ""It's dire, and it's a failure on behalf of the international community and the UK government... to not be providing these basic services to people."" Obstetric consultant Brenda Kelly, who has trained medics in Gaza, held a banner containing the names of health workers killed in the conflict. She said during her time in Gaza she had been met with ""such humanity, hospitality, and courage"". Dr Gardner, who grew up in Northern Ireland, added: ""Conflict begets conflict, violence begets violence... we will never get peace unless people get round a table.""

Israel orders Khan Younis evacuation in southern GazaPublished18 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel has told Palestinians in Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, to leave their homes. The city hosts hundreds of thousands who fled northern Gaza as Israel began a ground operation against Hamas. The new order suggests the military operations could soon move towards the south of the Gaza Strip. Israel says the aim is to wipe out Hamas, following its attack on Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 12,000 people have been killed by Israel since then, including 5,000 children. On Saturday, Israeli missiles struck a residential building in Khan Younis, killing 26 people, a local health official said. Israel has not yet commented on the incident. But it has been dropping leaflets in the wider area, urging people to leave for shelters. ""We're asking people to relocate. I know it's not easy for many of them, but we don't want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire,"" Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told US network MSNBC on Friday. Israel did not want to see ""civilians caught up in the crossfire"", Mr Regev said. He said Israeli troops would need to advance into the city to remove Hamas fighters from underground tunnels, adding he was ""pretty sure"" those being urged to relocate ""won't have to move again"" if they head west, towards the Mediterranean Sea. Mr Regev said the areas they were being asked to move to would ""hopefully have tents and a field hospital"", although no such plans have yet been publicised, and it is unclear if such facilities would be able to accommodate potentially well over a million evacuees. Because the western areas are close to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, humanitarian aid could be brought in ""as quickly as possible"", Mr Regev said. Like elsewhere in the Gaza Strip, southern Gaza has been in the grip of a humanitarian crisis since 7 October, when Israel enforced a full-scale blockage. There have been widespread reports of water, food and fuel shortages, as well as concerns about healthcare facilities and sanitation conditions. Israel has launched near-constant air strikes across much of the Gaza Strip, as well as a ground incursion into northern Gaza, including reducing much of Gaza City - the enclave's largest city - to rubble. The UN estimates that at least 1.5 million people in Gaza are internally displaced, with overcrowding a major concern. Many are sheltering in UN facilities, as well as hospitals, churches and public buildings. Much of the recent fighting has centred on Gaza City's al-Shifa Hospital, where Israel says Hamas has been operating a command-and-control centre, which Hamas denies. Israel is yet to provide substantial evidence to back its claim. Hundreds of people are reported to have left al-Shifa on Saturday, with one journalist who left the hospital telling the BBC ""we raised our hands and carried white flags"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have denied ordering an evacuation of the hospital, but said it had agreed to a request from a hospital director and was providing a ""secure route"" for those wishing to leave. Hamas officials say 120 patients remain at the hospital, along with premature babies. There are also reports that a UN school-turned-shelter in northern Gaza has been hit, with many casualties. The Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip told the AFP news agency that at least 50 people had been killed in an Israeli strike on the Al-Fakhoura school. BBC Verify has geolocated footage to the school that shows many people - including women and children - with severe injuries or lying motionless on the floor in different parts of the building. There are more than 20 such casualties visible in the footage, and around half of these are seen in one particular room on the ground floor, which also shows signs of considerable damage. An IDF spokesman told the BBC that he could not confirm it was an IDF strike and was looking into the incident. The head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) Philippe Lazzarini said he had seen ""horrifying images and footage of scores of people killed and injured"" in one of his agency's schools ""sheltering thousands of displaced"". ""These attacks cannot become commonplace, they must stop,"" he said.",2023-11-18T15:02:14.000Z

He has vowed to continue advocating an ""end to violence"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer instructed his MPs to abstain on the amendment, thougheight shadow ministers resigned to vote for it.

It was defeated by 125 votes to 294, with 56 Labour rebels joining other opposition parties to demand a ceasefire, against the Conservatives who opposed it. Mr Dhesi says he has since received abuse and death threats over his abstention. He said: ""I have openly called for a ceasefire, but also acknowledge that neither Israel or Hamas are agreeing on one yet, even though a lot of work has been done to hopefully bring an end to these horrors. ""I abstained on all other parties' amendments - as is usual practice - but voted for the comprehensive Labour amendment which was only tabled the night before calling for 'an end to the violence in Israel and Palestine'."" The Labour motion also called for the release of all hostages, the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, and lifting of the siege.

Israel says it will allow two trucks of fuel a day into GazaPublished18 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel says it will allow two fuel trucks a day to enter the Gaza Strip, after pressure to do so from the US. A US State Department official says around 140,000 litres of fuel will be allowed in every two days. Most of that is intended for trucks delivering aid, as well as supporting the UN in providing water and sanitation, the official said. The rest is for mobile phone and internet services, which had been cut off due to a lack of fuel. On Friday, the company which provides Gaza's communications said that its services were returning after receiving some fuel via Unrwa, the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees. The US official said Washington exerted considerable pressure on Israel to push this fuel agreement through. The deal had been agreed in principle weeks ago, the official added, but was delayed by Israel for two reasons. Israeli officials told the US that fuel had not actually run out in southern Gaza, and they also wanted to wait and see if they could negotiate a hostage deal first. The head of Unrwa warned on Thursday that the agency may have to suspend all of its activities due to the lack of fuel. In its latest situation report, the agency said it required ""160,000 litres of fuel every day for basic humanitarian operations"" - more than double what has been agreed. Earlier, an Israeli official said the new fuel allowance would be brought in through the Rafah crossing to the civilian population in the southern Gaza Strip via the UN, provided that it does not reach Hamas. The Israeli official said the fuel would give ""minimal"" support to water, sewage and sanitation systems, in order to prevent the outbreak of epidemics that could spread in the area. International organisations have repeatedly expressed grave concerns over the humanitarian situation unfolding in the Gaza Strip. The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously warned of ""worrying trends"" in the spread of disease in Gaza, where the lack of fuel and Israeli bombardment have severely disrupted the healthcare system and sanitation facilities. On Friday, Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian Territories, said that more than 70,000 cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea had been recorded, according to Reuters - figures significantly higher than expected. Fuel is needed in Gaza to run the enclave's desalination plant, to provide electricity to homes and hospitals, and for sanitation, transport, and communications infrastructure. It is also crucial for the delivery of aid around the territory. Israel has been blocking fuel from entering Gaza, arguing that it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes. Before the latest war Israel provided the majority of Gaza's electricity, and some was produced by the enclave's sole power plant which is no longer functioning. On Saturday in Gaza's south, the director of Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said it had received the bodies of 26 people, and 23 others with serious injuries, after an air strike on a residential building in Hamad city. The Israeli military has not yet commented on the report. Meanwhile, the Red Crescent said at least five Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a building in the Balata refugee camp in the West Bank city of Nablus. The Israeli army said it was checking on the reports. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told Israel to take ""urgent"" action to ""de-escalate tensions in the West Bank, including by confronting rising levels of settler extremist violence"". The strike happened a day after Israeli military said it killed at least seven militants in two separate confrontations in the West Bank. Israel's latest siege and military operation began following Hamas's brutal 7 October attack, when the group - which is banned as a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other powers - killed around 1,200 people and took more than 230 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. At least 12,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel began its retaliatory strikes, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the Palestinian enclave.",2023-11-18T05:20:24.000Z

Tanzanian student taken hostage by Hamas confirmed deadPublished17 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Tanzanian government has confirmed the death of a student taken hostage in the Hamas attack on Israel. Clemence Felix Mtenga, 22, was one of two Tanzanians taken by the group on 7 October. It is unclear how he died. The country's foreign ministry said it was in touch with Israel over the other Tanzanian hostage, Joshua Mollel. More than 230 hostages were taken in the assault by Hamas, and at least 1,200 people killed. Israel says the hostages - which were taken from Israel to the Gaza Strip - come from 25 countries, including one South African who is yet to be identified. Approximately 260 Tanzanians study agriculture in Israel, and both Mr Mtenga and Mr Mollel had been in the country as part of an agricultural internship programme,Israel's foreign ministry said on X. The pair had only landed in Israel in September, and were due to study there for 11 months. Mr Mtenga had been living on Kibbutz Nir Oz and working at a dairy farm in the afternoons,a friend and fellow student told the BBC. When news of his kidnapping broke last month, his sister said hiswhole family were worried about him, but remained hopeful he would be rescued. She said: ""He should be courageous where he is, know that we love him and that we pray for him day and night, hoping that he will be back soon."" Tanzania's foreign ministry said Mr Mtenga's family had been informed, and that officials were liaising with the Israeli government to send his body home. Mr Mollel's situation is currently unclear. Before it was confirmed that he had been taken hostage, his father told the BBC hecould not eat or sleepbecause he was desperate to know what had happened to him. The last words he said to his son before he disappeared were: ""Be on your best behaviour because you're somewhere new, and make the most of the internship you're there to do.""

Gaza: Gillian Keegan says school protests 'unacceptable'Published17 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The education secretary has said she is ""deeply concerned"" about children skipping lessons to attend protests calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Pupils were among hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters at events around the UK on Friday, amid a row over whether they should miss class. The number of youngsters on strike is unclear but turnout appears fairly low. Demonstrations took place in various cities, with some signs reading ""stop killing children"". Education Secretary Gillian Keegan posted on X, previously Twitter, on Friday afternoon: ""I'm deeply concerned that some children are attending political protests during the school day."" She added that ""missing school for activism is unacceptable."" Protests listed by the Stop the War coalition included events on Friday in Harrow and Redbridge in London, Manchester, Glasgow, Bristol and Burton, Staffordshire. Many children, ranging in ages from the very young through to sixth formers, attended with their parents. Bristolian school pupils handed in a petition calling for a ceasefire to representatives at the city council on Friday morning. The Green Party's co-leader, Carla Denyer, who is also a local councillor, collected the petition during the event and told the crowd: ""[Hamas'] atrocities do not in any way justify the level of bombardment of civilians, including many Gazan children, that has shocked the world."" Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages. Israel responded with air strikes on Gaza and has launched a ground offensive. More than 12,000 people have been killed, including more than 4,500 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. A pro-Israel demonstration last month in central London called for the safe return of hostages from Gaza, with protesters in Trafalgar Square holding up photographs of those missing. Among the pro-Palestinian demonstrators in Burton Upon Trent on Friday were Zubia and her son Yahya. The 10-year-old said: ""I'm here because innocent people are dying. Most of them are children and we need to support them to raise awareness."" Stop the War said it was ""providing support"" to school students and parents, who it said were ""self-organising"" the strikes with help from the School Strike For Palestine organisation. Videos have shown demonstrators in Luton, while students gathered in Tower Hamlets, London, on Thursday in an event Stop the War claims attracted around 400 school children and another 100 adults. A Department for Education spokesperson told the BBC: ""Children should be in school. ""While we recognise these young people should be able to peacefully express their views, we do not condone them missing out on their education."" The Metropolitan Police was unable to say how many people attended demonstrations in London on Friday. But a spokeswoman told the BBC: ""Strikes and protests by pupils are primarily a matter for school staff, but where they take place it is likely that local officers will be sent to ensure the safety and security of those involved. ""Their priority in these situations is safety but in the event that any offences occur they will respond appropriately."" School strikes are rare - but four years ago, they regularly took place around the UK and the globe to highlight concerns about global warming. Those protests, partly inspired by Greta Thunberg, have continued but often in lower numbers, aftermillions of children took part in one event in September 2019.

Biden facing growing internal dissent over Israel's Gaza campaignPublished17 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"US President Joe Biden is under growing pressure to rein in Israel's military campaign against Hamas in Gaza. The thousands of civilian casualties and desperate humanitarian conditions have alarmed Arab allies, but also stirred an extraordinary level of criticism from within his own administration. ""I'm stunned by the intensity,"" said Aaron David Miller, who worked as an adviser on Arab-Israeli relations during a 25 year tenure at the US State Department. ""I've never seen anything quite like this."" Several internal memos have been sent to Secretary of State Antony Blinken through a channel, established after the Vietnam war,  which allows employees to register disapproval of policy. An open letter is also said to be circulating at the Agency for International Development (USAID). Another has been dispatched to the White House by political appointees and staff members representing dozens of government agencies. Another to members of Congress by staffers on Capitol Hill. Much of this dissent is private, and the signatures are often anonymous out of concerns the protest might affect jobs, so the full scale of it is not clear. But according to leaks cited by multiple reports, hundreds of people have signed on to the wave of opposition. An administration official has told the BBC that these concerns are very real and there are active discussions about them. At a minimum, the letters are asking that President Biden demand an immediate ceasefire, and push Israel much harder to allow for more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. In some cases, the language is stronger, echoing the rhetoric of young political activists and apparently reflecting to some degree a generational divide that is more critical of Israel and sympathetic to Palestinians. The letters condemn the atrocities carried out by Hamas during its surprise 7 October attack that killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians. More than 12,000 have been killed in Gaza by Israel since that attack, according to the latest figure from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has said it is trying to minimise civilian casualties in the war in Gaza but has not been successful, blaming this on Hamas. The high number of Palestinian deaths is a ""font of the dismay"" in the administration, according to Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, a former US diplomat who is now president of the Middle East Policy Council. The administration's support for the Israeli military operation appears for many ""far too much of a one-sided position for the US government"", she said. Ms Abercrombie-Winstanley signed dissent cables during her career and has been consulted by current employees about whether they should do so now. These memos feel like they have a ""broader reach"" than others, she said, drawing in people who are not necessarily working on the specific issue at hand. Ms Abercrombie-Winstanley believes the chorus of dismay has contributed to significant shifts in US language and approach, since the days immediately after the Hamas attack when President Biden pledged unwavering support for Israel in an emotional address. Propelled by the destruction in Gaza and growing anger in the Arab world, the administration's rhetoric on protecting civilians has become more insistent. ""Far too many Palestinians have been killed"" in Gaza, Mr Blinken said recently. He and other senior officials are now treating humanitarian assistance as not only a moral imperative, but a strategic one too. This is something Mr Blinken highlights when meeting frustrated employees in listening sessions, according to State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller. He makes clear that ""it is the United States of America, not any other country, that was able to secure an agreement to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza"" and ""to get humanitarian pauses"". The secretary of state is aware of the disquiet simmering in his building and has made a point of addressing it. ""We're listening,"" he wrote after returning from his recent trip to the Middle East, in an email obtained by the BBC. ""What you share is informing our policy and our messages."" But it has not changed core policy approaches, nor appeared to have had significant influence on Israel's military campaign. The Biden administration has become more open about airing its growing divergences with Israel. Mr Blinken has deliberately set out principles of Palestinian governance and statehood for the ""day after"" in Gaza, that Israel's right-wing government rejects. The president is frequently on the phone to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and senior officials keep up a steady drumbeat of visits to the region, pressing Israel to follow the laws of war. But there's no suggestion the Biden administration is considering using its main leverage, putting conditions on its massive military assistance to Israel, which was ramped up even further after the Hamas attack. And Biden signalled this week that the US had not given Israel a deadline for its military campaign to end. It will end when Hamas ""no longer maintains the capacity to murder, abuse and just do horrific things"" to Israel, the president said. The bottom line is that the US and Israel have the same goal, according to Mr Miller, the former adviser at the State Department. Both want to destroy Hamas's capacity as a military organisation so it can never mount a 7 October-style attack again. With that aim in mind, he said, a full ceasefire that ends hostilities in pursuit of peace does not make operational or political sense. It only delays war, Mr Miller said, ""because you're not going to get a negotiated ending to this... The tactics may differ, but the objective remains the same"". So what exactly would force President Biden to change course? Most likely not his internal opposition. For all its ferment, the dissent in the administration is not yet a revolt. Only one State Department official has publicly resigned. Mr Miller suggests it would more likely take an external event, such as the unconditional release of all the hostages held by Hamas, or a single Israeli operation that results in mass Palestinian casualties, although the bar has been set quite high. There are also political risks for Mr Biden. His solidarity with Israel is shared by Republicans and centrist Democrats, but concerns within the younger and more left-wing elements of the Democratic Party are growing. His former election campaign staffers have sent their own letter to the president calling for a ceasefire. Gwen Schroeder, who worked on Mr Biden's digital team during the 2020 election, was one of the signatories. She said Israel's ""disproportionate response"" in Gaza showed that Palestinian lives ""mean less than those of our Israeli allies"". ""I'm not ashamed of getting Biden elected,"" she said, but added: ""I grapple with this every day, you know, is this the administration that I fought so hard for?"" It is too early to say how these sentiments might affect Mr Biden's bid for re-election next year, but it does underline the tightrope that he is walking. He has been telling Israeli leaders that the way they fight this war will determine what is possible after it ends. How much he is able to influence that is important, because he will be linked with whatever the outcome.",2023-11-17T18:22:03.000Z

Labour MP Jo Stevens's office vandalised after Gaza votePublished17 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Police have launched an investigation after a Labour MP who abstained on the Gaza vote had her office vandalised. Shadow Welsh secretary Jo Stevens's Cardiff office was daubed in red paint and covered in posters which accused her of having ""blood"" on her hands. She called the incident ""intimidating"" and ""threatening"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's stance on the Israel-Gaza war caused amajor rebellionwith 56 of his MPs voting for an immediate ceasefire. Beth Winter was the only Welsh Labour MP to back the ceasefire. The red paint and banners appeared on Ms Stevens's office in Albany Road, Roath, on Thursday night, with some accusing the Cardiff Central MP of supporting the deaths of babies in Gaza. Another poster said the Labour MP had ""blood on your hands"". Ms Stevens toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastshe was shocked by the damage, which occurred during an event she said was described as a ""vigil"". ""I absolutely support the right to protest, but what was done last night has gone way beyond that,"" she said. ""If you have someone write murder across your door, it is intimidating."" Adam Johannes from the Cardiff Central Anti War group said about 200 people gathered outside the office. ""We don't feel our MP is representing the majority opinion in our constituency,"" he said. ""We had a march down Albany Road, returned back and dispersed."" Mr Johannes said organisers asked people to  protest ""peacefully and respectfully"", but added: ""I think we have to look at the bigger picture. After the vote... many people said they felt a sense of powerlessness. ""We're seeing very catastrophic realities, emotions are running high."" He said the group would like Ms Stevens to arrange a forum in which the situation in Gaza could be openly debated with constituents. South Wales Police said it was investigating criminal damage and that ""a number of items have been seized for examination"". First Minister Mark Drakeford hasechoed the stancetaken by Sir Keir, who called for longer ""humanitarian pauses"" to allow aid to reach civilians in Gaza. The issue has divided Labour, with ten of Ms Stevens's fellow frontbenchers stepping down from their jobs over the vote, including eight shadow ministers. Ms Stevens said she ""found it particularly surprising"" that a former Member of Senedd had been present at the protest. ""I would have thought at the very least, that this individual would have had some understanding of the effect that this will have on my team,"" she added. ""This is a workplace and my staff team and I, as well as my constituents who come to my office every day for help, should be able to do so in safety."" Former Plaid Cymru MS Bethan Sayed said she had taken part in the protest ""peacefully"", and accused Ms Stevens of failing to ""hear and respect"" the views of her constituents who support a ceasefire. ""I took part peacefully,"" Ms Sayed said in a statement. ""I'd urge Jo Stevens MP to consider her actions as opposed to focusing on me."" Plaid Cymru's three MPsvoted for the ceasefirebut their parliamentary leader, Liz Saville Roberts, criticised the damage caused to the office. ""Jo and I voted differently this week and I strongly disagree with Labour's stance,"" she said. ""But attempts to intimidate elected representatives through vandalism and harassment are unacceptable and counterproductive."" Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas, which it considers a terrorist group, in retaliation for the 7 October cross-border attack by hundreds of gunmen. At least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's assault on Israel and about 240 others were taken hostage. Since Israel started its counter-attack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,500 people have been killed in the territory and the United Nations has warned of a ""humanitarian disaster"".",2023-11-17T17:30:29.000Z

Gaza: Belfast-born man confirms his two children have crossed borderPublished17 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Belfast-born man whosewife and other family members were killed in Gazahas said his children have crossed the border into Egypt. Khalid El-Estal, 30, had appealed for help reuniting with his children. His four-year-old son Ali and one-year-old daughter Sara have now been allowed through the Rafah border crossing. Mr El-Estal told BBC News NI that it was a ""great feeling"" to know his children were on their way to him. ""It's hard for me but for my wife I will take care of the children. I will do my best to be strong,"" he said. ""The thing that hurts me is that they will not be able to remember their mother as I remember her."" Mr El-Estal was born in Belfast and attended primary school in the Botanic area while his father worked as a lecturer at Queen's University. When he was aged eight, the family relocated to Gaza, where he met his wife, Ashwak Jendia, at university. Israel began bombarding Gaza after Hamas's 7 October attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 hostages were taken. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 11,500 people have been killed in the territory since 7 October - of whom more than 4,500 were children. Mr El-Estal was working in Saudi Arabia when his wife was killed along with his mother, brother, uncle and two cousins. On Wednesday, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said 23 Irish citizens had crossed into Egypt from Gaza. He said it was ""very welcome news"" that some families with children had successfully crossed the Rafah checkpoint. Mr Martin said another group of about 40 Irish citizens and dependents were due to leave the warzone. On Thursday, the tánaiste travelled to southern Israel, following a visit to Egypt on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters there he said three more Irish citizens had crossed into Egypt on Thursday, a lower number than hoped for, due to ""processing delays"". He also said the Israeli foreign minister, Eli Cohen, has assured him that the majority of Irish citizens remaining in Gaza would be able to exit in the coming days. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said 26 Irish citizens and dependants had crossed the border into Egypt on Wednesday and Thursday, where they are receiving support from the Irish Embassy in Cairo. A spokesperson added: ""Embassy staff are at the border today again. A number of Irish citizens and their families are in the process of crossing. We hope to be able to confirm more details later in the day.""",2023-11-17T16:20:36.000Z

Labour MP repeats call for Israel-Gaza ceasefire after votePublished17 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Labour MP who defied leader Sir Keir Starmer to back calls for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war has repeated his demand that the fighting must stop. Afzal Khan was amongeight shadow ministers to step down from the frontbenchafter the vote earlier this week. Labour has instead called for a ""humanitarian pause"". Manchester Gorton MP Mr Khan said the answer was not to be ""more barbaric"" than Hamas. ""An eye for an eye. We will all end up blind and that's not the way forward,"" he said. ""I feel in the response it is almost collective punishment and I feel Israel has crossed all red lines."" He said it was clear that the focus should now be on finding peace. ""I know this as 18 years ago I set up the Muslim Jewish Forum of Greater Manchester,"" he said. ""In the last Gaza war we brought people together and, after that session, the thing that hit me the strongest was a simple point - both sides wanted peace."" About 240 people were kidnapped by Hamas gunmen during the group's 7 October massacre, which killed 1,200 people. More than 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its retaliatory strikes, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The vote was on a Scottish National Party amendment to a government motion on its plans for the year ahead, presented in the King's Speech last week. It called for an end to the ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"" and urged ""all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire"". Sir Keir had signalled before the vote that MPs holding a frontbench role would be sacked if they backed the ceasefire call. As a result, Mr Khan resigned from his role as shadow minister for exports along with Jess Phillips, Yasmin Qureshi, Paula Barker, Sarah Owen, Rachel Hopkins, Naz Shah and Andy Slaughter. It was defeated by 125 votes to 294, with the 56 Labour rebels joining other opposition parties to demand a ceasefire. A Labour motion, tabled by Sir Keir, backed a pause in the conflict instead, to allow in more humanitarian aid was also heavily defeated. Mr Khan said while he felt Labour was moving in the right direction as a humanitarian pause was a ""starting point,"" he said progress was slow. ""I think the scale of the losses we already have demands that we should have a ceasefire,"" he said. ""My concern is we don't stop here. We need to now resolve it so we don't end up with a cycle of violence where innocent people in Israel and Palestine lose their lives."" Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,XandInstagram?

Berlin on edge for Erdogan after fierce Israel criticismPublished17 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"No speeches in front of cheering crowds. No joint public appearances between leaders. And a rumoured joint visit to a Germany-Turkey football match in Berlin that is not happening after all. For a state visit, Friday's visit by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Germany is remarkably low key. He is first meeting German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and then will have dinner with the chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Two meetings behind closed doors and a private dinner hardly speak of fanfare. Apart from the intense security in the centre of the capital - the same level as precautions taken for US presidential visits — the German government hopes Mr Erdogan's visit will pass with little notice. That's because this event couldn't come at a worst time for Germany. Relations between President Erdogan and successive German governments have been difficult for years, with spats between Berlin and Ankara regularly breaking out. When German government spokespeople mention the phrase ""difficult partner"" you know they're talking about President Erdogan. But the Hamas atrocities in Israel on 7 October, and Israel's subsequent retaliation in Gaza, have left Germany and Turkey on opposite sides of the conflict. Over the past month the Turkish president has become increasingly strident in his criticism of Israel. He has refused to condemn the killings and hostage-taking by Hamas, referring to the group as ""liberators"". Hamas is classed as a terrorist organisation by Western allies, including Germany. He has also appeared to call into question the Jewish state's existence by saying that Israel's ""own fascism"" undermined its legitimacy. Jewish leaders in Germany have accused Mr Erdogan of fuelling antisemitism with such comments and there have been calls for the German government to cancel the Turkish president's visit. For Germany, historical Nazi guilt for the Holocaust means that support for the state of Israel is non-negotiable and a key cornerstone of Berlin's foreign policy. When asked in a news conference earlier this week about President Erdogan's comments Chancellor Scholz called them ""absurd"". Both Olaf Scholz and former Chancellor Angela Merkel have repeatedly called Israel's security Germany'sStaatsräson, or ""reason of state"", a vague term German leaders use to express the idea of unwavering German support for Israel. But as Israeli attacks on Gaza intensify, and the death toll rises, that principle is coming under strain. After the initial shock of the Hamas attacks, German mainstream media is increasingly also portraying the humanitarian suffering in Gaza, leading to a growing unease about Israel's actions. On German streets outrage at Israel's actions is growing and pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been held most weekends since 7 October. Germany has large Arab diaspora communities with links to, or sympathy for, people in Gaza. Support for Palestinians is also traditionally a totemic issue for some German left-wing groups. There are fears that any comments about the conflict by President Erdogan during his visit could inflame tensions. But Germany and Turkey need each other. Germany is an important trade partner for Turkey. It also is home to the world's largest Turkish diaspora community and is an electoral battleground for President Erdogan. He is popular with some German-Turks. Around three million people of Turkish heritage live in Germany, with half of them still able to vote. In May a majority of Turkish voters in Germany who took part in the election put their cross by Mr Erdogan. Berlin, meanwhile, needs Turkish help to control migration from the Middle East. Chancellor Scholz is hoping to revive a refugee pact with Turkey to send back asylum seekers and wants more Turkish support for the West in Russia's war in Ukraine. Behind closed doors on Friday those issues will be discussed. But the German government will be more nervous about what President Erdogan might say in public. It was in May, after Mr Erdogan's re-election as Turkish president, that Chancellor Scholz issued the invitation to Berlin. He probably now wishes he hadn't.",2023-11-17T13:52:00.000Z

Bowen: Ceasefire demands will grow without proof of Hamas HQ at al-ShifaPublished17 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"It is now days since Israeli forces entered al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, and what appears to be happening on Friday is that they are continuing their search for evidence of this being a key Hamas command centre. We have to remember that there is no independent scrutiny inside the hospital; journalists cannot move freely into Gaza, and any who are reporting from the site are working under the aegis of the Israeli military. The evidence Israel has produced, so far, I do not believe to be convincing in terms of the kind of rhetoric Israelis were using about the set-up at the hospital, which suggested this was a nerve centre for the Hamas operation. If there was a nerve centre there - and there has been speculation about that possibility since 2014 - then the Israelis have not yet revealed definitive evidence of its existence to the outside world. What has been recovered includes some Kalashnikov rifles - these are common in the Middle East - a tunnel entrance, of which there are many in Gaza, some military uniforms and a booby-trapped vehicle. The discovery of and evidence for a major Hamas headquarters underneath the hospital is of course still possible. The hospital was, after all, built by the Israelis in the 1970s during its full control of the territory, and it is a large site which will take time to thoroughly search. It's well known that the Israeli architects who designed al-Shifa included extensive basements. It is also possible that the Israelis have found something, and for their own reasons - military or security perhaps - have decided not to reveal it yet. Why that would be the case is unclear - Israel has a lot riding on al-Shifa. From the beginning of this war on 7 October, when a surprise attack launched by Hamas killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, it has said reaching the hospital is one of its main targets. Proving Hamas is using Gaza's medical facilities to cover its operations is a key Israeli objective and it is an accusation Hamas has repeatedly denied. Israel's major justification for killing so many people in Gaza - more than 11,500 in more than a month, according to the latest figure from the territory's Hamas-run health ministry - is that Hamas was using them as human shields. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benyamin Netanyahu claimed in an interview on Thursday night that Hamas had a military command centre at the hospital. He is also pointing to what he called ""strong indications"" that hostages had been held there too, after the Israel Defense Forces said the body of 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss, who had been kidnapped from her home in Be'eri near the Gaza boundary, was discovered in a house near al-Shifa. Negotiations are ongoing with Qatar to try to reach some sort of deal to recover the more than 200 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas inside Gaza. But if solid evidence of a Hamas headquarters cannot be found, at al-Shifa or elsewhere, then the pressure on Israel from the international community to negotiate a ceasefire is going to increase. So many civilians have been killed by Israel in Gaza in the last 42 days that concern is growing about Israel's methods in the United States - which is the only international power the Israelis really worry about. US President Biden said from the outset that Israel has the right to defend itself, but that it must do it in the right way - meaning following the laws of war. On Wednesday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution asking for extended humanitarian pauses that the Americans did not veto. This was significant because it is the first resolution that's gone through without a condemnation of Hamas that was not vetoed by the US or the UK. And another interesting development is the publication by what's called the ""Elders"", a group of retired prime ministers, presidents and elder statesmen and women from around the world, of a statement condemning Hamas but also saying that ""Destroying Gaza and killing civilians is not making Israel safer. These actions will breed more terrorism across the region and beyond. There is no military solution to the conflict."" So Israelis are aware that pressure for a ceasefire is steadily growing, and with increasing questions about Israel's strategy, that will intensify. This is not going to end easily. I do not think there is going to be a clear moment when Israel can say they have got the job done and can leave Gaza. The government also does not appear to have a plan for the day after. Mr Netanyahu has only said he expects to have security responsibility there to prevent the ""re-emergence of terror"". Anything that Israel does there, in a place that has experienced huge levels of killing and destruction, will see them having to deal with more than two million people who will hate them. They could possibly face an insurgency, depending on how long they stay. So for Israel it's crucial to prove that it had no choice other than to use methods that killed thousands of civilians, so that its allies will continue to shield it from international pressure for a ceasefire.",2023-11-17T13:15:23.000Z

Netanyahu says Israel 'not successful' at minimising Gaza casualties but blames HamasPublished17 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel's prime minister has said it is trying to minimise civilian casualties in the war in Gaza but has been ""not successful"", blaming this on Hamas. In an interview with CBS News, Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was firing at Palestinians trying to get safety. Hamas ""don't give a hoot about the Palestinians"", he said. More than 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza, Hamas's health ministry says, since Israel went to war after Hamas's deadly attack on 7 October. Some 1,200 people were killed and about 240 were taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities and military bases. Several of the missing people have since been confirmed dead, with Hamas blaming Israeli air strikes, although the claim cannot be independently verified. Mr Netanyahu told the BBC's US partner CBS that Israel would ""try to finish the job"" of wiping out Hamas in Gaza with minimal civilian casualties. He said: ""That's what we're trying to do: minimal civilian casualties. But unfortunately, we're not successful."" Mr Netanyahu said the Israeli military dropped leaflets urging people to leave certain areas and called civilians on their mobile phones warning them to leave but claimed Hamas was preventing this ""at gun point"". ""Any civilian death is a tragedy. And we shouldn't have any because we're doing everything we can to get the civilians out of harm's way, while Hamas is doing everything to keep them in harm's way,"" he said. He added Hamas had ""fired at the safe corridors that we provided for the Palestinians"". Addressing Israel's military raids on Al-Shifa hospital - the biggest medical facility in Gaza - Mr Netanyahu said there were ""strong indications"" that Israeli hostages were being held there and this was ""one of the reasons we entered"". He said there were no hostages at the hospital when forces entered the hospital on Wednesday, claiming: ""If there were [hostages], they were taken out."" Israel said it has further intelligence about those being held, but Mr Netanyahu said ""the less I say about it, the better"". Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of housing a major base underneath Al-Shifa - something which Hamas and hospital authorities have always denied. Mr Netanyahu did not elaborate on what information Israel had to suggest that hostages had been held at Al-Shifa. But he said Israel had ""concrete evidence"" that there were ""terrorist chieftains and terrorists"" in the hospital who he said had fled as Israel's forces entered. ""Hamas was using the patients in that hospital as a human shield,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu said Israel had warned the hospital authorities it was going to enter the facility and to move patients out of the way, adding they were ""doing this very gingerly"" because they were trying to ""do the moral thing"". Israel's military said its soldiers had found the bodies of two hostages -65-year-old Yehudit Weissand 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano - in the vicinity of the hospital.",2023-11-17T12:08:20.000Z

Israel finds second hostage body near Al-Shifa hospitalPublished17 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel has confirmed that it has found the body of a second woman who was taken into Gaza by Hamas in its attack last month. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 19-year-old Cpl Noa Marciano was discovered in a building next to the Al-Shifa Hospital. On Thursday, the IDF said theyfound the body of a 65-year-old hostage in a house near the same hospital. Troops are continuing their search in and around Gaza's biggest hospital. A spokesman for the IDF, Daniel Hagari, wrote on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that Israeli intelligence led soldiers to the exact location of her body. The IDF did not give further details on how Cpl Marciano died. Hamas's military wing claimed she was killed in an Israeli air strike on 9 November, though this could not be independently verified. Cpl Marciano was serving as a lookout at the Nahal Oz kibbutz when it was stormed by part of a wave of gunmen who had burst through the nearby Israel-Gaza border, attacking dozens of Israeli communities, several military bases and hundreds of young people attending a music festival. According to Haaretz, Cpl Marciano's mother, Adi Marciano, said in an interview that she last spoke to her daughter on the morning of the attack. ""She told me she was in a protected space and that there had been an infiltration... She said that she had to end the call. I didn't hear shots or screams. Half an hour later, I sent her a message, but she didn't reply."" She had appeared in a video released by Hamas on Monday. The IDF called it ""psychological terrorism"". So far, only four of the 240 hostages who were abducted by Hamas last month have been freed. Israeli officials say that at least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's cross-border attack. Since Israel started its counter-attack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,400 people have been killed in the territory. Al-Shifa, Gaza City's largest hospital, became the focus of fighting at the start of the week and was raided by the Israeli military on Wednesday morning. The IDF says Hamas has been using the hospital as a command centre and has spent two days searching the complex for evidence of this. Hamas denies operating there and the BBC cannot independently verify claims by either side.",2023-11-17T10:40:47.000Z

Hundreds gather in central London for vigil ahead of ceasefire votePublished17 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hundreds descended on central London for a vigil ahead of the ceasefire vote. People of all nationalities and religions came together for a moment of reflection and solidarity, opposite Downing Street, following the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war. Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders as well a Labour and a Lib Dem MP gave speeches calling to end the violence. The ceasefire vote was defeated by 125 votes to 294. The vote called for an end to the ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"" and urged ""all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire"". It was supported by 56 Labour rebels who joined other opposition parties to demand a ceasefire, against the Conservatives who opposed it. The vigil was held opposite Downing Street to acknowledge the suffering experienced by the Israelis and Palestinians. Nearby a separate protest was held calling for a ceasefire, where banners were held. In central London, Rabbi Josh Levy, co-leader of Progressive Judaism, said ahead of the vote: ""It's a hugely important sight. Certainly many of us feel that we've needed this over the course of the last few weeks. ""This moment of coming together. We have much more in common than we do that divides us. Even in the heart of the pain of this moment. ""This event was about making that statement, and that we need to look after each other."" Magnen Inon, whose parents were murdered by Hamas on 7 October, told BBC London: ""Our shared future is based on the belief that all human beings are equal, and deserving of respect and safety. ""This is how I was raised and how I am raising my own children."" Julie Siddiqi, Muslim co-organiser and a faith-relations consultant, said: ""It's been very emotional. Looking over and seeing everyone who has made a point of coming. ""It shows and reminds me that there is more humanity not hatred. ""People don't want this binary nastiness and it's really important for us to come together and show that we can cut through that with hope."" Rabbi Charley Baginsky, co-leader of Progressive Judaism, added: ""I don't think people are going to get over their grief by seeing this [vigil] but they can see that we can stand together in our grief. ""We have different starting places for our grief but we need to reminded that we are human, and we are friends and we need to hold each other in this moment."" Sheikh Ibrahim Mogra, senior Muslim leader, said: ""Tonight I'm feeling very hopeful. The number of people who have turned up today is a demonstration that people genuinely want us to get along. ""Our hearts are all broken, but there is hope when we can recognise each others grief and pain and speak out against any hatred that will divide our communities. ""Standing together we have a remedy to patch things up between our communities who have lived together for decades. ""We have friendships and good relations between religions in this country and we can't allow that to be taken away from us."" The vigil is a fraction of the size of weekend protests, but it is mid-week and a working day for many who might otherwise like to be here. Nevertheless, thousands of people have come to Westminster. The crowd is made up of Christians, Muslim, Jews, people of other faiths and none, all ages and colours. A minute's silence has been held for victims on both sides of the war and I've seen Imams and Rabbis hugging each other in the name of humanity.

Ceasefire protest at Democrats' national headquarters turns violentPublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Police and protesters clashed outside the Democratic party's national headquarters on Wednesday, forcing dozens of lawmakers to be evacuated. Officials said the pro-Palestinian organisers calling for a ceasefire in Gaza were gathered ""illegally and violently"". Demonstrators said they were provoked by police in riot gear who rushed them without warning. Six officers were treated for injuries and a protester was arrested. Officers said they were pepper sprayed and punched by people in the crowd. The incident unfolded on the front steps of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington DC, where political leaders, including the highest-ranking House Democrat, had gathered for a reception. Chants of ""ceasefire now"" from roughly 150 activists outside the event resounded in the halls. Capitol Police swiftly descended on the crowd to block off the building's entrance and exit. Demonstrators said the policing quickly turned aggressive. Video footage of the incident appears to show protesters shouting and screaming as the police barrel in to restrain them. ""It is shameful the way that nonviolent protesters and members of our community were met with violence tonight,"" Dani Noble, a demonstrator who arrived from Philadelphia, told the Washington Post. He said police were ""pulling on folks that are disabled or have chronic illnesses, pulling people to the ground"". Inside, police rushed to direct lawmakers to safety. Security has been tightened around the building since pipe bombs were found at both the Democratic and Republican Party headquarters on the eve of the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot. No-one has ever been arrested for the planting of those devices. California congressman Brad Sherman wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""Was just evacuated from the #DNC after... protestors grew violent, pepper spraying police officers and attempting to break into the building."" In a statement shared with US media, House Democratic leaders said members of the House Democratic Caucus, aides and guests were participating in an event inside when ""some protesters escalated their activity in a manner that exceeded a peaceful demonstration"". ""We are thankful for the service and professionalism of the US Capitol Police officers who worked to ensure that Members, staff and visitors were able to safely exit,"" the leaders said. ""We strongly support the First Amendment right to freedom of expression and encourage anyone exercising that right to do so peacefully."" The protest was organised by a coalition of groups, including Jewish Voice for Peace Action and If Not Now, both US Jewish groups who are critical of Israel. The confrontation on Wednesday was the latest in a series of demonstrations across the US, as tensions over the Israel-Gaza war intensify. On Tuesday, thousands of pro-Israel protesters crowded the fields at the National Mall in Washington DC, demanding the release of Hamas-held hostages. A number of rallies have pressed for the US to call for a ceasefire in the conflict, which President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has resisted. On Capitol Hill, many Republicans have rejected the idea of a ceasefire outright. The militant group Hamas entered Israel on 7 October and killed roughly 1,200 people while kidnapping more than 200 others. In response, Israel has killed more than 11,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run healthy ministry.",2023-11-16T22:40:49.000Z

Israel says hostage's body found near main Gaza hospitalPublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel's military says its soldiers have found the body of an Israeli hostage taken into Gaza by Hamas in its attack last month. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss was discovered in a house near Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. It said that her family had been informed, and her body would be returned to Israel. Ms Weiss was kidnapped from her home in Be'eri near the Gaza border. She had been recovering from breast cancer when Hamas launched its deadly attack on 7 October, but was without her medication when she was taken, according to the Bring Them Home Now group. Ms Weiss worked in her kibbutz's kindergartens, managed the dining room and specialised in nursing before she retired, the group said. She was a ""loving full-time grandmother"", it said, adding she had a love for culture, sports, travelling and baking. Her husband, Shmulik, a rabbi, was killed in the Hamas assault. In a statement, the IDF said that Kalashnikov rifles and rocket-propelled grenades were among the weapons discovered where her body was located. ""Unfortunately, Yehudit was murdered by terrorists in Gaza and we did not get to her in time,"" IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a news briefing on Thursday evening. He did not give further details on how she was killed. So far only four of the 240 hostages who were abducted by Hamas last month have been freed. Israeli officials say that at least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October by hundreds of gunmen. Since Israel started its counter-attack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,400 people have been killed in the territory. Al-Shifa, Gaza City's largest hospital, became the focus of fighting at the start of the week, and was raided by the Israeli military on Wednesday morning. The IDF says Hamas has been using the hospital as a command centre, and has spent two days searching the complex for evidence of this. Hamas denies operating there and the BBC cannot independently verify claims by either side. Currently more than 650 patients, 500 medical staff and over 5,000 displaced people are taking shelter in the hospital. Its director Muhammad Abu Salmiya saidconditions were ""tragic"" at the site, and the hospital has run out of oxygen and water.",2023-11-16T21:56:15.000Z

Al-Shifa Hospital director in Gaza says no water or oxygen leftPublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The director of the Gaza Strip's main hospital raided by Israeli soldiers says the facility has now run out of oxygen and water, and patients ""are screaming from thirst"". Muhammad Abu Salmiya said the conditions were ""tragic"" in Al-Shifa, where there were more than 650 patients, 500 medical staff and 5,000 displaced people. Israeli tanks were surrounding the hospital in Gaza City, he said, with drones buzzing overhead and Israeli soldiers still moving around inside, as their search of the complex lasted a second day. Israel's army said its operation against Hamas was proceeding in a ""discreet, methodical and thorough manner"". However a journalist trapped inside the hospital, Khader, told the BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf by phone that Israeli troops were ""everywhere, shooting in all directions"". The BBC has not been able to independently verify either of the reports. Since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched their raid on Al-Shifa early on Wednesday, they have released several photos and videos of what they say are Hamas weapons and equipment. On Thursday they said they had found an ""operational tunnel shaft and a vehicle containing a large number of weapons"". Mr Abu Salmiya said Israeli troops had blown up Al-Shifa's main water line. ""Sniping operations continue, no-one can move from one building to another, and we have lost communication with our colleagues,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, Khader told the BBC that Israeli troops had ""stormed all departments"", destroying the southern part of the building's wall and dozens of cars. Before Khader's phone line cut off, he also said that armoured bulldozers had been brought in. Gaza's Hamas-controlled health ministry reports that Israeli bulldozers ""destroyed parts of the southern entrance"" of the medical complex. Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the 7 October cross-border attack by hundreds of gunmen. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist group, as does the UK, US and European Union. At least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's assault on Israel and about 240 others were taken hostage. Since Israel started its counter-attack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 11,400 people have been killed in the territory and the UN has warned of a ""humanitarian disaster"". On Thursday evening, the IDF announced that the body of one of the hostages had been found near Al-Shifa. The IDF identified the victim as Yehudit Weiss, saying she had been kidnapped from her home in Be'eri - a kibbutz in southern Israel. At the same time, there have been reports of amajor phone and internet outage in Gazabelieved to have been caused by telecom companies running out of fuel supplies. The IDF said their soldiers were continuing their ""complex"" operation against Hamas at the hospital. ""Soldiers are proceeding one building at a time, searching each floor, all while hundreds of patients and medical staff remain in the complex,"" an official said in an update on Thursday evening. The official reiterated the IDF's claim that there was a ""well-hidden terrorist infrastructure in the complex"". Hamas has repeatedly denied that its fighters have been operating inside the hospital. On Thursday, Osama Hamdan, the most senior Hamas leader in Lebanon, ridiculed the Israeli weapons claims, saying that all the arms had been brought in and planted in the hospital by Israelis. Asked by the BBC why progress on talks to release hostages had failed, he said that on three occasions they had been close to a deal but each time it had been stopped by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Israeli government has not commented on Mr Hamdan's allegation. In a separate development, Israel has dropped dropped leaflets in the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza, warning people in four towns to evacuate their homes and head to shelters. If that is an indication of an upcoming military operation around the southern city of Khan Younis, it could be a real concern to the hundreds of thousands now sheltering there. Before the war, Khan Younis was home to about 300,000 people - a number that has now grown to one million after Israel urged civilians to move south for their safety.",2023-11-16T21:29:52.000Z

Gaza faces communications blackout due to lack of fuelPublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Mobile phone and internet services have gone down across the Gaza Strip due to a lack of fuel for back-up generators, Palestinian telecoms companies say. Telecom firms Paltel and Jawwal said all energy sources sustaining their networks were depleted, and an internet monitor confirmed a major outage. Israel has blocked all but one delivery of fuel to Gaza since the start of its war with Hamas five weeks ago. The UN said a blackout could jeopardise civil order and undermine aid efforts. ""We regret to announce that all telecom services in Gaza Strip have gone out of service as all energy sources sustaining the network have been depleted, and fuel was not allowed in,"" Paltel said in a statement on Thursday afternoon. At the same time, internet observatory NetBlocks said live metrics showed Gaza was ""in the midst of a major internet outage"", with telecom services likely to be unavailable to most residents. Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip to destroy Hamas, which it considers a terrorist group, in retaliation for the 7 October cross-border attack by hundreds of gunmen. At least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's assault on Israel and about 240 others were taken hostage. Since Israel started its counterattack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,400 people have been killed in the territory and the United Nations has warned of a ""humanitarian disaster"". The Israeli government has defended blocking fuel deliveries during its campaign, saying it is concerned that Hamas could steal fuel and use it for military purposes. One tanker carrying 23,000 litres of diesel crossed from Egypt on Wednesday, but Israel restricted its use only for the refuelling of UN aid lorries. Other key services have already had to shut down because of similar issues. This includes hospitals, water pumps, desalination plants, sewage treatment facilities and bakeries. The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, confirmed that all communications were down across Gaza on Thursday night. He said it would now be extremely difficult to get any information about what was happening on the ground elsewhere, particularly in places like Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where Israeli forces were carrying out an operation for a second consecutive day. Before the start of the blackout, a journalist trapped inside the complex had told him by phone that troops were storming all of the hospital's departments and ""shooting in all directions"". Our correspondent has been unable to re-establish contact since then. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - which runs the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza - said he feared the blackout could cause a further breakdown of civil order. ""These are signs of a situation when you have a blackout and you cannot communicate with anyone anymore... that triggers and fuels even more the anxiety and the panic,"" Philippe Lazzarini, the UN leader, told a news conference in Geneva. ""This can provoke or accelerate the last remaining civil order that we have in the Gaza Strip. And if this completely breaks down, we will have difficulties to operate in an environment where you do not have a minimum of order."" Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday that a prolonged communications blackout could ""provide cover for atrocities and breed impunity while further undermining humanitarian efforts and putting lives at risk"". Mr Lazzarini also said that he believed there was a ""deliberate attempt to strangle"" Unrwa's work in Gaza, warning that the agency might have to entirely suspend its operations if its fuel supplies ran out. Unrwa, which is hosting 813,000 displaced people in its facilities, says it needs at least 160,000 litres of fuel every day to maintain its basic operations. ""If the fuel does not come in, people will start to die because of the lack of fuel,"" Mr Lazzarini warned. ""Exactly as from when, I don't know. But it will be sooner rather than later."" The head of the UN World Food Programme meanwhile said that supplies of food and water were ""practically non-existent"" and that ""only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders"". ""With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,"" Cindy McCain warned. But a spokesman for the Israeli defence ministry body overseeing policy for the Palestinian territories, Cogat, told the BBC: ""As far as I know, there is no lack of food and no lack of water in Gaza."" Col Moshe Tetro said Israel was fulfilling its obligations to facilitate the delivery of aid and that the number of lorries crossing from Egypt was increasing every day. The UN says 1,139 aid lorries have entered since 21 October, compared to about 500 each day on average before the war. Col Tetro also stressed that Israel was doing everything it could to reduce civilian casualties, including by telling residents in the north of Gaza to flee southwards for their own safety as it focuses its air and ground assault on what it sees as Hamas's stronghold. Many of the 1.5 million displaced people have fled to Khan Younis, where the pre-war population of 300,000 has tripled. On Thursday, there were reports that Israeli forces had dropped leaflets urging people to evacuate four towns east of the city - Bani Shuhaila, Khuzaa, Abasan and Qarara - where tens of thousands of people have been sheltering. An Unrwa spokeswoman said the south had ""not been safe at all"", and an expansion of Israel's ground assault into the region would be bad news.",2023-11-16T19:48:35.000Z

Starmer calls for Labour unity after rebellion in Gaza votePublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants Labour to be ""as united as we can"" after a series of frontbench resignations over the Israel-Gaza war. Ten frontbenchers quit tovote for an SNP motion in the Commons backing a ceasefire, in defiance of Sir Keir's instructions. He said he was focused on ""alleviating the situation on the ground"" in Gaza, not ""party management"". But he added: ""I want us to move forward as united as we can."" There was ""absolute unity"" across the party about helping people in Gaza, the Labour leader told ITV News. He said: ""You wouldn't expect me to stand here today and say my concern is Labour Party management rather than the hostages and the innocent civilians and children that are dying in Gaza. ""My focus and attention is there, and that's where it is and where it will always be."" Jess Phillips, Afzal Khan and Yasmin Qureshi were among eight shadow ministers who quit their roles to back an amendment to the King's Speech, tabled by the SNP, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Two parliamentary aides also voted for it. A Labour motion, tabled by Sir Keir, backed a pause in the conflict instead, to allow in more humanitarian aid. Both were heavily defeated. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said it was ""disappointing"" that Labour MPs had rebelled - but added that those who had left the front bench would be supporting the party from the back benches. She said Sir Keir ""wants to act like a prime minister in waiting and that means aligning ourselves with the international community and taking practical steps to get support into Gaza, whilst also putting pressure on Hamas to release the hostages."" The day after the vote, six Labour councillors in Walsall, including the group leader, resigned from the party over its position on Gaza. In a letter, they said they felt ""betrayed"" over the party's stance, adding the leadership had ""lost its moral compass"". Since the beginning of the conflict, at least 56 Labour councillors have left the party over the issue. Sir Keir had signalled before the vote that MPs holding a frontbench role would be sacked if they backed the ceasefire call. At least seven Labour frontbenchers who have publicly supported the idea of a ceasefire did not vote for the SNP amendment and kept their roles. One of these MPs, Rushanara Ali, the shadow business minister,said she would have resignedif it ""meant the needle would move in the slightest over forcing a ceasefire"". Ms Phillips, who announced she was quitting her role as shadow domestic violence minister ahead of the vote, told the BBC: ""I don't feel like I am rebelling against the Labour Party"". Inan interview with Radio WM, she said: ""I feel like I am taking a position with my heart, my head and my constituents. ""There is no animosity between me and Keir Starmer. I will work every single day to ensure a Labour victory and, as I said in my resignation letter, I am incredibly proud of the work the Labour Party is proposing to do in government about the thing I care the most about in politics and that is violence against women and girls."" Thevote was on an SNP amendmentto a government motion on its plans for the year ahead, presented in the King's Speech last week. It called for an end to the ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"" and urged ""all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire"". It was defeated by 125 votes to 294, with 56 Labour rebels joining other opposition parties against the Conservatives who opposed it. There are 29 Labour MPs in the shadow cabinet - none of whom rebelled - but around half of the party's 198 MPs hold some kind of frontbench position, including as whips in charge of party discipline. Labour, like the Conservative government, the United States and the European Union, is calling for ""humanitarian pauses"" to help aid reach Gaza. Compared with a formal ceasefire, these pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours. They are implemented with the aim of providing humanitarian support only, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions. Last week, the US said Israel would begin to implementdaily four-hour military pausesin areas of northern Gaza.",2023-11-16T18:59:11.000Z

"No animosity with Starmer over Gaza vote, Jess Phillips saysPublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Labour MP Jess Phillips says there is no animosity between her and Sir Keir Starmer after she quit the party front bench over a ceasefire vote on Gaza. Ms Phillips said on Wednesday that it was with a ""heavy heart"" that she was leaving her shadow minister role. ""I don't feel like I am rebelling against the Labour Party, I feel like I am taking a position with my heart my head and my constituents,"" she said. Ten of the party's shadow frontbenchershave now left their jobs over the vote. MP's voted 293 to 125 toreject the Scottish National Party's motioncalling for all parties to agree to an ""immediate ceasefire"" in the region. Labour leader Sir Keir had previously argued that a ceasefire would not be appropriate,but had advocated for pauses in the bombardment to allow aid into Gaza. But Ms Phillips, MP for Birmingham Yardley, said there had been a ""huge outpouring of grief and pain"" from her constituents about the ongoing situation in Israel and Gaza. ""I don't feel that the current military action is doing anything to secure a stable future in the Middle East,"" she said. Ms Phillips, who had served as the party's shadow domestic violence minister since 2020, was one of56 Labour MP's who voted for an immediate ceasefire. She said she understood Sir Keir and Labour's position but said she did not see where current action ""ends in a safer [and] securer Israel and Palestine"". ""Newborn babies in incubators are not a threat, and the cost of their lives because there is no fuel getting into Gaza, is just not something I can sit with,"" she told BBC Radio WM. ""No one is suggesting that Israel doesn't have the right to defend itself - I am suggesting that it has to be completely and utterly proportionally targeted and protects peace in the future."" MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana had also voted for a ceasefire. ""There is nothing humanitarian about letting children eat a little today, only to bomb them tomorrow,"" she said. ""The only humanitarian way forward is an immediate ceasefire.""

Gaza: Belfast-born man confirms his two children will be evacuatedPublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Belfast-born man whosewife and other family members were killed in Gazahas told BBC News NI of his happiness after learning that his children will leave the Palestinian territory. Khalid El-Estal, 30, had appealed for help reuniting with his children after the loss of his family members. His four-year-old son Ali and one-year-old daughter Sara are now included on an evacuation list to leave Gaza. They are due to enter Egypt via the Rafah crossing in the next day. The children are currently situated at the crossing and will travel to Ireland with his brother-in-law, he added. ""You can't imagine how I felt, I was very happy and excited about that... I was thinking 'what should I bring for the kids?' ""I hope they will make it, if not today then please tomorrow,"" he said. ""They have a good chance [in Ireland]."" Mr El-Estal was born in Belfast and attended primary school in the Botanic area while his father worked as a lecturer at Queen's University. When he was aged eight, the family relocated to Gaza, where he met his wife, Ashwak Jendia, at university. He told BBC News NI it was a ""very long love story"" with his ""beautiful, talented"" wife. Israel began striking Gaza after Hamas's 7 October attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 hostages were taken. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 11,500 people have been killed in the territory since 7 October - of whom more than 4,500 were children. Mr El-Estal was working in Saudi Arabia when his wife was killed along with his mother, brother, uncle and two cousins. ""Everything was going in the right path, we were expecting to come [to Ireland] together,"" he said of his wife. ""Years of love, happiness... all of it is gone."" Mr El Estal said he is now worried for his father and brothers who remain in the Gaza Strip. ""My brothers are Irish citizens, they didn't want to come to Ireland because they [didn't] want to leave my father and mother, but now it's different. ""I'm really hoping they can figure something for my father, because he's not Irish, to join me here... I can't imagine leaving my father alone. ""How can he face all of this, and I am his eldest son? I should be with him."" On Wednesday, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Micheál Martin said 23 Irish citizens had crossed into Egypt from Gaza. He said it was ""very welcome news"" that some families with children had successfully crossed the Rafah checkpoint. Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ, Mr Martin said there is another group of about 40 Irish citizens and dependents due to leave the war zone. On Thursday, the tánaiste travelled to southern Israel, following a visit to Egypt on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters, Mr Martin said three more Irish citizens have managed to cross into Egypt today, which is a lower number than hoped for, due to ""processing delays"". He also said the Israeli foreign minister, Eli Cohen, has assured him that the majority of Irish citizens remaining in Gaza will be able to exit within the next three days. On Wednesday evening, a motion which called for the expulsion of Israel's ambassador to Ireland wasrejected in the the Dáil (Irish lower house of parliament). Meanwhile, in the UK Parliament, MPs voted to reject a call for an immediate ceasefire.

Third of London Labour MPs rebel over Gaza ceasefire votePublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Nearly a third of Labour's London MPs voted against the party line to support a motion calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer hadordered his party to abstain on the SNP motionand instead back one calling for humanitarian pauses. Over 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Hamas's 7 October attacks, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The ceasefire motion was defeated by 294 to 125. In total, 56 Labour MPs rebelled, including 15 of the party's 46 MPs in London. Andy Slaughter, MP for Hammersmith, was sacked from his role as shadow solicitor general for not abstaining on the vote. BBC London has contacted Mr Slaughter for comment. MP for Walthamstow Stella Creasy, who voted for a ceasefire, told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We're all under no illusions that how the UK parliament acts on its own will make very little difference. It's about what we ask our government to prioritise. ""Many of us felt personally it was important to send the message that the government should be working with a range of organisations to see how a ceasefire which involved all parties [...] could be achieved."" The vote was on an SNP amendment to a government motion on its plans for the year ahead, presented in the King's Speech last week. In a statement after the vote, Sir Keir, who represents Holborn and St Pancras, said he regretted the stance of some of his party.

More powers to protect war memorials from protesters consideredPublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The government is considering whether police need new powers to stop protesters climbing war memorials. A breakaway group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators scaled the Royal Artillery Memorial in London's Hyde Park Corner on Wednesday night. Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said their actions were ""inflammatory"" but did not break any laws. No 10 said it was an ""affront"" and that it would look at further measures so officers could take action in future. ""We will look at what further measures are needed so that the police can have confidence in taking action on this,"" the prime minister's official spokesman said on Thursday. ""We do believe there are extensive powers available to them but the public will have been shocked and I'm sure appalled by what they saw."" Protesters calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict marched outside the Houses of Parliament on Wednesday night. A group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators were filmed climbing up the Hyde Park Corner monument, which was built to commemorate the thousands of soldiers from the Royal Artillery who were killed in World War One. In a statement, the Met said officers were on the scene quickly but ""not quickly enough to prevent the protesters accessing the memorial"". Met chief Sir Mark said his officers recognised the behaviour to be ""unfortunate"" and ""inflammatory in certain ways"", but not illegal. Speaking at an Institute for Government event on Thursday, he said it was for the government to consider whether officers should be given further powers to respond to protests. Asked about the police response to the incident, he said: ""What the officer didn't do last night was make up a law that it's illegal to do something and do an arrest which would have been illegal, clearly. ""The officers intervened, as officers often are doing, to try and de-escalate risk of conflict, even when there isn't explicit power to do it."" Sir Mark refused to be drawn on an article inthe Times newspaper written by former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, in which she accused officers of ""playing favourites"" when policing protests. In her article, Mrs Braverman accused Met Police of applying a ""double standard"" to its policing of recent pro-Palestinian protests. She claimed aggressive right-wing protesters were ""rightly met with a stern response"", while ""pro-Palestinian mobs"" were ""largely ignored"". James Cleverly, who replaced Mrs Braverman as home secretary, said he would be examining whether the police needed new powers following Wednesday's protest. ""These - and the police have said this - are deeply disrespectful actions,"" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain on Thursday. ""The war memorials recognise the sacrifice people have made for our freedom, and abusing, desecrating behaviour like this is deeply, deeply offensive. ""I will look at what further measures need to be taken so the police can take action on this."" Other measures intended to strengthen police powers to deal with protesters arealso reportedly being considered by the government, including lowering the threshold for when police could apply for a ban to stop marches taking place. Protests have been taking place in London and across the UK to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel began air strikes on Gaza following Hamas's attacks on 7 October, in which 1,200 were killed and more than 200 hostages were taken. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then.",2023-11-16T17:22:07.000Z

Pro-Palestinian rooftop protest at Leonardo UK in SouthamptonPublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Pro-Palestinian activists have carried out a rooftop protest at a defence firm in Southampton. The Palestine Action group said its members scaled the roof of the Leonardo UK factory on First Avenue. Hampshire police responded alongside fire and ambulance crews shortly before 07:00 GMT. Two men and a woman were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass and criminal damage. Damage to the roof of the building was being assessed, police said. A Palestinian flag could be seen attached to railings on the roof during the protest. In a statement, police said ""Officers attended with our colleagues from other emergency services to monitor the situation and ensure the safety of those involved. ""We have also been in communication with the owners of the premises. ""Everyone has the right to free speech and peaceful protest however, officers will take necessary action against those who choose to act outside the law."" Leonardo UK describes itself as ""one of biggest suppliers of defence and security equipment"" to the Ministry of Defence. In a statement, it said: ""This morning a small group of protesters entered the Leonardo site in Southampton and were removed by police. ""Together with the authorities, we are keeping our people fully informed."" Palestine Action said on social media the factory was targeted as it was producing ""weaponry for Israel"". Police said one of the men arrested was 28 years old and from Cambridge, and the woman was 68 and from Norwich. The force said it did not have age or address details for a second man being held. The Israeli military has been launching air and artillery strikes in response to militant group Hamas' unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October when hundreds of gunmen infiltrated communities near the Gaza Strip.

BBC goes inside Al-Shifa hospital with the Israeli armyPublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"We clamber into the Al-Shifa hospital complex in darkness over a caved-in wall in the perimeter - knocked through with an armoured bulldozer on Tuesday to allow safer access for Israeli forces. The BBC and one other television crew were the first journalists invited by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to view what Israel says it has found at the site. Any extra light here is risky so we grope our way through the compound, following the heavily armed troops sent to escort us - stepping around makeshift tents, debris and sleeping people. Doctors at the hospital say they have been working without power, food or water for days now - and that critically ill patients have died as a result, including newborn babies. People displaced by the fighting in Gaza have been sheltering in the hospital complex. But Israel says Hamas also runs a network of underground tunnels, including under Al-Shifa hospital. The masked special forces leading us into the building over debris and broken glass are a sign of how tense the situation still is here. Our presence, just a day after Israel took control of the hospital, speaks volumes about Israel's motivation to show the world why they are here. In the brightly lit corridors of the MRI unit, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus shows us three small stashes of Kalashnikovs, ammunition and bullet-proof vests - he says they have found around 15 guns in all, along with some grenades. Lt Col Conricus also shows us some military booklets and pamphlets, and a map that he says is marked with potential entry and exit routes from the hospital. What it tells us, he says, is that Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes. ""[And] we uncovered a lot of computers and other equipment which could really shed light on the current situation, hopefully regarding hostages as well."" The laptops, he says, contain photos and videos of hostages, taken after their kidnap to Gaza. There is also recently released footage, shared by Israeli police, of their interrogations of Hamas fighters arrested after the October attacks. The BBC was not shown what was on the laptops. This, Lt Col Conricus said, suggested Hamas were here ""within the last few days"". ""At the end of the day, this is just the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. ""Hamas aren't here because they saw we were coming. This is probably what they were forced to leave behind. Our assessment is that there's much more."" Israel's army has spent weeks fighting its way to the gates of the hospital. The streets around have seen some of the fiercest fighting in Gaza in the past few days. Our visit was tightly controlled; we had very limited time on the ground and were not able to speak to doctors or patients there. Our journey in to Gaza, in an armoured personnel carrier sealed tight from the darkness outside, traced the path of Israel's first major ground incursions into Gaza weeks ago. On the screens inside the military vehicle, the agricultural land morphed slowly into distorted streets strewn with large pieces of debris, and the blurred outlines of shattered buildings. Just south of Gaza City, we stopped to change vehicles, clambering out on to undulating mounds of twisted metal and large chunks of rubble and concrete. Small groups of soldiers crouched over tiny campfires, cooking a makeshift dinner beside the rows of tanks. ""It's a secret recipe,"" one winked. Above them, buildings had collapsed in strange shapes. The rolling metal door of a shopfront hung cramped, halfway open. A Star of David was scrawled on a wall in red spray-paint; inside it someone had written ""IDF"", and above it, the words: ""Never Again"". The attacks of 7 October changed the calculation for Israel in its conflict with Hamas. It has vowed to end years of uneasy standoff, by destroying both the military and political power of Hamas, designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and others. That means going into the heart of Gaza City, including inside Al-Shifa. Israeli forces are still searching for the tunnels beneath the hospital that they believe Hamas fighters may have withdrawn to, perhaps with some of the hostages. This building has become a central focus of Israel's war, described as a key command centre, even potentially the ""beating heart"" of Hamas operations. And in the brutal information war that tails this conflict, this is Israel's moment of truth. After almost 24 hours securing and searching the hospital, Israel says it has found weapons and other equipment that could help provide information on both Hamas fighters and the hostages. But it has its hands on neither. We leave the hospital, and rumble down the wide avenue that leads to Gaza's coastal road. Gaza City is now ruled by tanks. The ghostly avenues look in places like an earthquake zone, the destruction is so severe. It is clear what it took for Israel to get control of these streets.

Labour ceasefire stance divides voters in target seatsPublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"While they are united in their horror at the Israel-Gaza conflict, the Muslim and Jewish communities of Bury have very different views as to the stance the UK's politicians should be taking. The borough has an above average Muslim and Jewish population, and is split into two parliamentary constituencies - Bury North and Bury South. Bury North is currently held by the Conservatives and Bury South is Labour - the MP Christian Wakefielddefected from the Tories in 2022. Both seats are Labour targets for the next election. The UK government and the Labour Party have both called for a ""humanitarian pause"" in the conflict, to allow aid into Gaza and to get Israeli hostages out. The Labour Party has now tabled a motion in the House of Commons, which says that the party ""believes all human life is equal and that there has been too much suffering… over the past month in Gaza."" It calls on all parties to follow the ""rules based international order"" and strengthens language around the need to allow in humanitarian assistance. But Bury resident Waheed Arshad illustrates the problem the Labour Party has by not calling for a permanent ceasefire. He has previously voted Labour, but says Muslim voters in the area feel ""taken for granted"" by the party, which will impact both their voting and their enthusiasm for campaigning. Many are watching Wednesday's potential vote in the Commons on the issue closely, he believes, ""disappointed"" in the Labour leadership's positioning so far. ""Disappointed is probably an understatement on this particular issue. You can see the frustration in the way people are talking,"" he says. ""There's no real recognition of the fact that actually this is a lot of people taking this position, they want a ceasefire and that's not being reflected. It's very easy for us to say do it because Muslims are saying it or we can swing it - I really want him to do it because it's the right thing to do and from a humanitarian point of view."" Waheed has heard opponents of a ceasefire argue that it might give Hamas the opportunity to regroup, but doesn't accept that view. ""You've got to look at the bigger picture in terms of where we are at now with close to 10,000 deaths. Where do we draw the line?"" In the absence of Labour calling for a permanent ceasefire, Waheed says he would look to support an independent candidate. ""Conversations are starting to happen"", he says, about council candidates who could stand against Labour councillors. In total, there are 14 marginal seats the Labour Party would hope to win at the next general election, where the Muslim population is bigger than the current Conservative majority. There are five Labour target seats where Jewish voters could play a crucial role. But while ethnicity and religion are significant factors in determining how people feel about the Israel-Gaza war, clearly individuals will make their own judgements as to which party or candidate represents them best. Hendon in north London,which is currently held by the Conservatives,is another marginal constituency with a higher than average Jewish and Muslim population. Laurence Stein is the kind of swing voter Labour will be hoping to win over at the next election. In the past he's voted for both Labour and Conservative and the crisis in the Middle East is the sort of issue that could decide his vote. ""If you'd asked me this question a few weeks ago, I probably would have said I'd vote Labour,"" he tells me. ""And the reason I would have said that is because I am concerned about the cost of living."" ""Because I feel Rishi Sunak has been a really powerful ally of the Jewish people certainly since 7 October, and in truth before then as well, my views are changing and if there was a general election tomorrow, I would vote Conservative."" Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the Equality and Human Rights Commission found the Labour Party had been responsible for unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination over antisemitism. Mr Corbyn responded by saying that the scale of antisemitism within Labour had been ""dramatically overstated"" by his opponents. He now sits as an independent MP and is barred from standing as a Labour candidate. Laurence had been encouraged by Sir Keir Starmer's moves to rid his party of antisemitism, but is now uneasy about the views of some Labour colleagues as they call for a ceasefire. ""I like Keir Starmer. I think he's been a great ally to the Jewish people as well in this country but I am worried about the people sitting next to him and behind him."" When asked if there was anything the Labour leader could do to win him back, Laurence is ready with an answer. ""I think he could go to visit Israel and give his support to the Israeli government."" Daniel Stiassny, another Hendon constituent, says Sir Keir's position has cemented his support among some Jewish voters. He says he's voted Conservative at every election since 1992 but Labour has now won his vote. ""Had Starmer said he's calling for a ceasefire, had Starmer not backed the Jewish community, I think it would have been a disaster for them in terms of the Jewish vote,"" he says. ""I think Keir Starmer has shown some good solidarity with the Jewish people, some good solidarity with Israel and I hope he can maintain and I am sure they will. ""There will be some people on the left who will be trying to push him, sway him - but I think he's held his nerve."" Sir Keir will be hoping that by strengthening his language he can avoid further frontbench resignations and hold together a party that remains significantly ahead in the polls. But with both Labour and the Conservatives so far taking a very similar stance on the Israel-Gaza war, there are many who feel their voices are not being heard.",2023-11-16T08:34:04.000Z

Keir Starmer suffers major Labour rebellion over Gaza ceasefire votePublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Sir Keir Starmer has suffered a major rebellion over his stance on the Israel-Gaza war, with 56 of his MPs voting for an immediate ceasefire. Jess Phillips, Afzal Khan and Yasmin Qureshi were among shadow ministers who quit their roles toback the motion from the SNP. Ten of the party's frontbenchers have left their jobs over the vote, including eight shadow minsters. Sir Keir has instead backed pauses in the conflict to deliver aid. Announcing she was quitting her role as shadow domestic violence minister, Ms Phillips said she was voting with ""my constituents, my head, and my heart"". ""I can see no route where the current military action does anything but put at risk the hope of peace and security for anyone in the region now and in the future,"" she added. Ms Phillips, Mr Khan and Ms Qureshi, along with Paula Barker, announced they would be leaving shadow ministerial positions in the run-up to the vote. Sir Keir had signalled before the vote that MPs holding such a role would be sacked if they backed the ceasefire call. Other frontbenchers Sarah Owen, Rachel Hopkins, Naz Shah and Andy Slaughter have also left their roles after voting for the motion. Dan Carden and Mary Foy left posts as parliamentary aides. In a statement after the vote, Sir Keir said he regretted the vote of some of his party. ""I regret that some colleagues felt unable to support the position tonight. But I wanted to be clear about where I stood, and where I will stand"". He said Israel had suffered ""its worst terrorist attack in a single day"" at the hands of Hamas on 7 October. ""No government would allow the capability and intent to repeat such an attack to go unchallenged,"" he added. The vote was on an SNP amendment to a government motion on its plans for the year ahead, presented in the King's Speech last week. It called for an end to the ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"" and urged ""all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire"". It was defeated by 125 votes to 294, with the 56 Labour rebels joining other opposition parties to demand a ceasefire, against the Conservatives who opposed it. There are 29 Labour MPs in the shadow cabinet, but around half of the party's 198 MPs hold some kind of frontbench position, including party whips. Among the Labour MPs voting in favour of a ceasefire was Stella Creasy, who told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, while she respected Sir Keir's position, she defied party instruction as a matter of principle. ""Nobody is under any illusions that a single vote in the UK parliament is going to change the situation on the ground,"" she said, but ""advocating for a ceasefire is far better than the alternative of being silent."" SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said it was ""shameful that a majority of Tory and Labour MPs blocked calls for a ceasefire - and have condoned the continued bombardment of Gaza"". The voting took place amid demonstrations from pro-Palestinian supporters, who chanted ""ceasefire now"" outside Parliament. The UK has seen a series of protest marches demanding a ceasefire in recent weeks, with an estimated 300,000 people taking part in arally over the weekend, the biggest in the UK since the war began. In a bid to defuse the ongoing row over the party's position, the Labour leader had tabled his own amendment spelling out his position, which was defeated - but garnered 160 Labour votes. It supported Israel's right to self-defence after Hamas's ""horrific terrorist attack"" on 7 October, in which 1,200 people were killed, and called for the release of more than 200 people taken hostage. But it also said there had been ""far too many deaths of innocent civilians and children"" since Israel began striking Gaza in response. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then - of whom more than 4,500 were children. The amendment also called for longer humanitarian pauses to allow aid, calling this a ""necessary step to an enduring cessation of fighting as soon as possible"". Sir Keir has argued that a ceasefire would not be appropriate, because it would freeze the conflict and embolden Hamas. Labour, like the Conservative government, the United States and the European Union, is calling for ""humanitarian pauses"" to help aid reach Gaza. Compared with a formal ceasefire, these pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours. They are implemented with the aim of providing humanitarian support only, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions. Last week, the US said Israel would begin to implementdaily four-hour military pausesin areas of northern Gaza. There had been intense efforts to minimise frontbench resignations by strengthening criticism of Israel's conduct of the campaign in Labour's own motion. There will be relief in Labour leader's office that no one who sits round the very top shadow cabinet table broke ranks to support the SNP's ceasefire motion- though they are now looking for eight more junior shadow ministers and two parliamentary aides. While the rebellion stretched beyond Labour's left wing, the party leadership believe the scale of disunity won't be replicated in other policy areas. The assessment is that the passion and pressures relating to the Middle East are unique. Insiders say that Sir Keir's call for a pause not a ceasefire keeps him in lock-step with the EU and US. But some of his closest allies frankly recognise that calls for a ceasefire from an opposition Labour leader will have no effect on Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, never mind Hamas in Gaza. So in that sense, there's little logic to calling for it. But it means politically, he will have to face down continued pressure domestically to change position.",2023-11-16T07:45:15.000Z

How the dead are counted in GazaPublished16 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"In any warzone, counting the dead is a challenge. Gaza is no different. As battles there intensify, the chaotic situation - with bombardment by Israeli forces, on-the-ground fighting, communications blackouts, fuel shortages and crumbling infrastructure - makes getting accurate information on the numbers of people who have died extremely demanding. And Palestinian officials have said there are now ""significant difficulties"" in obtaining updated information because of the interruption of communications in the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-run health ministry is Gaza's official source for death numbers - which it updates regularly. On Monday evening, it said 11,240 people had been killed, including 4,630 children, since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October which prompted the current war. The figures have been publicly doubted by Israel. The number of those killed in the attacks in Israel, meanwhile, was initially put at 1,400 by Israeli authorities but was later revised down to about 1,200. US President Joe Biden has said he has ""no confidence"" in the Gaza statistics. But international organisations, such as the UN's World Heath Organization (WHO), have said they have no reason to disbelieve them. The BBC has been looking in detail at how the casualty figures for Gaza are counted. The health ministry in Gaza reports a regular death total on social media, with an additional breakdown of the number of women, children and the elderly who have been killed. The figures do not give the cause of death, but describe the dead as victims of ""Israeli aggression"". The ministry also gives figures for the injured and the missing. Some of the bodies remain trapped under piles of rubble, says the Palestinian Red Crescent. Health ministry officials say the death figures are recorded by medical professionals before being passed on to them and the figures only include people recorded dead in hospital. The figures do not distinguish between military and civilian deaths. And, because they do not take into account those who died at the scene of blasts whose bodies have not been found, or buried immediately, they may be an undercount, Gazan officials say. That point was amplified by the Biden administration last week, when a senior US official said the death toll was likely to be greater than the numbers being reported. ""We think they're very high, frankly,"" Barbara Leaf, assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, told a House Foreign Affairs Committee, ""and it could be that they're even higher than are being cited."" It stands in stark contrast to the view of Mr Biden himself, who, on 25 October, said he had ""no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed."" However, he did not provide any evidence for his scepticism. A day after Mr Biden's dismissal of the numbers, the health ministry in Gaza provided more information, publishing an extensive list of names of all those who had been killed between 7 and 26 October. The list included more than 6,000 full names with their ages, sex and ID numbers. How was it compiled? The BBC has spoken to people involved in gathering and organising the data as well as an academic who has checked for duplicates on the list of names. We have also spoken to an independent research group, Airwars, which is in the process of matching deaths it has investigated to names on the health ministry's list, and the UN - which has assessed death figures in Gaza during previous periods of conflict. Healthcare workers like Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a Médecins Sans Frontières plastic surgeon based in London who has been treating people at hospitals in Gaza City, are key to recording those figures. He says the hospital morgue records deaths after confirming the identity of the dead person with their relatives. The number of deaths registered so far, he believes, is far fewer than those that have actually occurred. ""Most of the deaths happen at home,"" he says. ""The ones we could not identify, we did not record."" However, once a body is found, it ""has to be taken to the hospital to be recorded"", says a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent. To examine the health ministry's list, the BBC cross-referenced names included on it with the names of dead people who had appeared in our reporting. One of those deaths the BBC reported was Dr Midhat Mahmoud Saidam, who was killed in a strike on 14 October. The BBC spoke to his former colleagues. Satellite imagery analysis carried out by the BBC showed damage to the area where he lived around the date of his death. An image posted on social media shows a body bag with his name and details written on it. Similar work, but on a larger scale, is being done by Airwars. As part of its work investigating civilian deaths, it has matched names of the dead on the health ministry list with areas that have been bombed. So far, Airwars has found 72 names on the ministry's list in five of the areas it has investigated, including Dr Saidham's. Its investigation also found 23 of his family members had also died and all were recorded on the health ministry list. Scrutinising the stats The BBC also spoke to the UN and Human Rights Watch - both of which said they had no reason to disbelieve the figures released by the health ministry in Gaza. The UN relies on the health ministry as a source for casualty figures in the area. ""We continue to include their data in our reporting, and it is clearly sourced,"" it said in a statement. ""It is nearly impossible at the moment to provide any UN verification on a day-to-day basis."" Others who have scrutinised the health ministry's figures include economics professor Michael Spagat, from Royal Holloway, University of London - who chairs the charity Every Casualty Counts which studies death tolls in wars. He says he and a colleague found just one duplicate entry in the health ministry dataset - that of a 14-year-old boy. However, one discrepancy remains hotly contested - that of the death toll after a blast at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City on 17 October. The health ministry said 500 people had been killed, and that figure was later revised down to 471. An assessment by US intelligence was lower, ""probably at the low end of the 100-to-300 spectrum"". Israel's military cited the al-Ahli figures as the basis for a claim that the Gaza health ministry ""continuously inflates the number of civilian casualties."" The BBC has made repeated attempts to contact the health ministry in Gaza, but has been unable to get a response so far. Prof Spagat has also looked back at previous conflicts, and found that health ministry figures in Gaza have held up under past scrutiny. In an analysis of health ministry death figures from the Israel-Gaza conflict in 2014, in which Gaza was bombed, and a separate record of death figures from that same year collated by Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem, Prof Spagat found overall consistency in the reported figures. The ministry of health said 2,310 Gazans had been killed in 2014, while B'Tselem counted 2,185 deaths. The UN said 2,251 Palestinians were killed, including 1,462 civilians and Israel's foreign ministry said the 2014 war killed 2,125 Palestinians. Discrepancies such as these are ""fairly normal"" says Prof Spagat, as some people may have died in hospital for reasons subsequently shown to be unrelated to violence in conflict. Ola Awad-Shakhshir, president of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, receives regular updates of deaths from Gaza. Ms Awad-Shakhshir says that Israel's interior ministry effectively controls ID numbers for newborn babies born in Gaza and the West Bank - the same ID numbers that appear on the Hamas-run health ministry's register of recorded deaths. The Israeli Population Registry Officeholds files that match those in Gaza and the West Bank. When the BBC approached a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces about why they have cast doubt on the Gazan death figures it said the health ministry was a branch of Hamas and that any information provided by it should be ""viewed with caution"". But it did not provide any evidence of inconsistencies in the data released by the health ministry. We also asked the Israeli prime minister's office about how the numbers of Israelis killed on 7 October by Hamas were recorded. It did not answer that question, however in recent days Israel has revised down the number of people killed during the attack to about 1,200, from the earlier figure of 1,400. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said the revised number was because many bodies were not immediately identified after the attack, and ""now we think those belong to terrorists... not Israeli casualties"". The Israeli government has not published a detailed list of the civilian casualties although some Israeli media outlets have assembled such lists with names, ages and locations of deaths. Israel's police says more than 850 bodies of civilians have been identified - work is continuing to try to identify remains using specialist forensic techniques. There is a public list of the Israeli soldiers killed so far that includes 48 who have died in the fighting inside Gaza.",2023-11-16T05:04:33.000Z

Al-Shifa: What we know about Israel's raid on Gaza's main hospitalPublished15 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israeli military has raided Gaza's main hospital in what it describes as a ""targeted operation against Hamas"". An eyewitness at Al-Shifa hospital told the BBC that troops moved in overnight and were interrogating people. On Wednesday, Israel said it found Hamas' ""operational centre"" at the hospital, sharing images of what it said were Hamas weapons and equipment. Hamas denies operating there and the BBC cannot independently verify claims by either side. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said he was ""appalled"" by the Israeli raid, while the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was ""extremely worried"" for patients and staff, with whom it had lost contact. The BBC has been speaking to a journalist and a doctor inside the hospital to find out what is happening there, while the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has also been providing updates. Khader, a journalist inside Al-Shifa, told the BBC's Rushdi Abualouf that Israeli troops were in ""complete control"" of the hospital and no shooting was taking place. He said six tanks and about 100 commandos entered the complex during the night. The Israeli forces then went room to room, questioning staff and patients. The IDF reportedly asked all men aged 16-40 to leave the hospital buildings, except the surgical and emergency departments, and go to the hospital courtyard. Soldiers fired into the air to force those remaining inside to come out, Khader said. However Muhammad Zaqout, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry's director of hospitals, told Al Jazeera that ""not a single bullet"" had been fired - because ""there are no resistors or detainees"" inside. Early on Wednesday, the IDF said its forces were in the midst of a ""precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area"" in the hospital. It said the raid was ""based on intelligence information and an operational necessity"", calling for the surrender of ""all Hamas terrorists"" present there. As the soldiers entered the hospital complex, they engaged with a number Hamas members and killed them, the IDF said. On Wednesday evening, the IDF said troops found ""an operational command centre, weapons, and technological assets"" belonging to Hamas inside the MRI building. It said it was ""continuing to operate in the hospital complex"", sharing images and videos showing what it said were Hamas weapons. In a seven-minute video, IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus pointed to security cameras that he said had been covered over, and weapons that he said were AK47 rifles hidden behind MRI scanners. The BBC has not yet been able to verify the video or its location. But unless Israel has more to reveal, the military's controversial operation inside the hospital did not net a major arsenal of weapons, reports the BBC's Orla Guerin in Jerusalem. Hamas knew Israel was coming, and therefore, if they were operating beneath the hospital, they would have had weeks to clear out through Gaza's extensive tunnel network, our correspondent adds. Israel's Army Radio reported that troops had not yet found any sign of any of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attack on Israel, when 1,200 other people were killed. The raid on Al-Shifa came shortly after the US publicly backed Israeli claims that Hamas had infrastructure underneath the hospital. However Dr Ahmed Mokhallalati, a plastic surgeon at Al-Shifa, told the BBC there were only civilians in the hospital. He said there were tunnels under every building in Gaza, including Al-Shifa hospital. According to international humanitarian law, hospitals are specially protected facilities. This means that parties to conflicts cannot attack hospitals, or prevent them performing their medical functions. They can lose their protection if they are used by a party to the conflict to commit an ""act harmful to the enemy"". The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says this could be something like ahospital being used as a base from which to launch an attack, as a shelter for able-bodied fighters, or to shield a military objective from attack. The IDF said it had repeatedly warned Hamas its ""continued military use of Al-Shifa jeopardises its protected status"", calling for the evacuation of the hospital before the raid. The WHO had warned that evacuating patients would be a ""death sentence"", given that the medical system was collapsing. Dr Mokhallalati told the BBC on Wednesday the hospital was without power, oxygen and water. On Tuesday, surgeries had been carried out without proper anaesthesia, with patients ""screaming in pain"". Doctors were unable to help one patient with burns, and had to just ""let him die"". Dr Mokhallalati said  six premature babies had died in recent days. ""Why can't they be evacuated,"" he said. ""In Afghanistan, they evacuated the cats and dogs."" The IDF said it was providing incubators, baby food and medical supplies.",2023-11-15T22:45:29.000Z

Aladdin and Olfat Sagga, who live Kirkdale, Liverpool, travelled to Gaza to visit family in October. They were in Gaza City when Israel's retaliation began following the 7 October attack by Hamas. The couple said 44 members of their wider families had since been killed inthe conflict. Speaking to the BBC at their home in Liverpool, the couple said they were now battling with the mental anguish of what they had witnessed. ""I don't feel that I am fine. I need someone to help me because we didn't think for one second that we were going to leave alive out of this war,"" Mrs Sagga said. ""We were pretty desperate."" Mr Sagga, 61, said when the bombs started falling ""everyone didn't know what to do"". ""Everyone was just jumping and wanting to take care of their relatives and kids and mothers and sons and families,"" he said. The couple were in the region to visit Mr Sagga's 97-year-old mother, who they transported with them to Khan Yunis in the south of Gaza when the bombing started. ""We were sleeping on the floor; my mother was there my sister was there and we woke up covered in glass and sand,"" Mr Sagga said. The couple said they travelled seven times to the Rafah crossing into Egypt before they were able to leave. Since returning to Merseyside, they said that they did not know if they would ever be able to return to Gaza. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,XandInstagram?

Layla Moran: MP confirms death of family member in GazaPublished15 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran has said a member of her family has died in Gaza. The Oxford West and Abingdon MP, whose mother is Palestinian, told the Commons her family member died due to their inability to access medical care. She was speaking ahead of a vote on a motion calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war. Ms Moran said it was the ""most difficult day"" she had endured in her parliamentary career. ""We are now over a month on from the atrocious attacks by Hamas on 7 October, and we were all right to utterly condemn the attacks,"" she told the House of Commons. ""But ahead of the votes that we are going to take in a moment I wanted to let the House know that today I lost my first family member. ""The reason why this is important, having spoken about how they are in a church in Gaza City and how they didn't, I am afraid, die of a bomb - instead they died perhaps for lack of food, perhaps for dehydration. ""Their health deteriorated in the last week and they couldn't get to the hospital they needed."" The MP has previously spoken about being ""deeply worried"" for her extended family in Gaza, with some sheltering in a church, unable to move south, after an Israeli missile struck their home. Ms Moran became the UK's first MP of Palestinian descent when she was elected in 2017, and is the foreign affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats. She told the Commons she was backing calls for a ceasefire. ""Today, I wanted to vote for peace. I wanted to be voting for a two-state solution, because that is the only way that these horrors will never be seen again,"" she said. ""I wanted to vote for getting Hamas out of Gaza, and I wanted to vote for those reasons for an immediate bilateral ceasefire, so that families like mine - but also families in Israel - don't have to endure this anymore."" She added that it was ""more than just party politics right now"". Last month, Ms Moran told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire: ""No longer are people saying, where do we go to be safe? ""The question they are now asking is, where do we want to be when we die?"" At least 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October, when gunmen infiltrated communities near the Gaza Strip. More than 200 hostages were snatched at gunpoint. In retaliation Israel launched a war against Hamas - proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, including the UK. Since then, more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza - 4,500 of them children - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Forty-six Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting inside Gaza over the same period, the Israel Defense Forces say. Follow BBC South onFacebook,X, orInstagram.

Ai Weiwei's London exhibition called off over Israel social media postPublished15 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Artist Ai Weiwei has said his new exhibition has been cancelled after he posted comments on social media referencing the Israel-Gaza conflict. The Chinese artist and activist's exhibition was due to open on Wednesday at the Lisson Gallery in London. Ai, who has been vocal in his support for the Palestinians, said he was ""committed to voicing my perspective"". The gallery said there was ""no place for debate that can be characterised as anti-Semitic or Islamophobic"". Its statement said: ""After extensive conversations with Ai Weiwei, following a comment he posted online, we together agreed that now is not the right time to present his new body of work."" His post, which has since been deleted, suggested that the ""sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people"" had been transferred and held against the Arab world. He also said the Jewish community has a strong influence in the media, finance and culture in the US, and that America's $3bn (£2.45bn) annual military support to Israel meant the two countries have a ""shared destiny"". Ai said he had received a notification from the gallery that his exhibition was ""effectively cancelled due to my tweet"". A representative for the artist said a further three exhibitions - at the Lisson Gallery in New York and the Galerie Max Hetzler in Paris and Berlin - had also been called off. Ai said he had replied to another user who had asked him a question, and he had ""attempted to be objective and neutral without moral judgment, accusations, or evaluation of human actions"". He also said that as an artist, he was only interested in free expression, not ""seeking correct expression"". However, he continued: ""When discussing correctness or wrongness, I must be wrong. I have always regarded free expression as a value most worth fighting for and caring about, even if it brings me various misfortunes... ""Incorrect opinions should be especially encouraged. If free expression is limited to the same kind of opinions, it becomes an imprisonment of expression. Freedom of speech is about different voices, voices different from ours."" In a separate statement, he said: ""If culture is a form of soft power, this represents a method of soft violence aimed at stifling voices. ""It's not directed solely at me but at the broader culture of a society lacking a spiritual immune system. When a society cannot withstand diverse voices, it teeters on the brink of collapse."" In its statement, the Lisson Gallery said ""all efforts should be on ending the tragic suffering in Israeli and Palestinian territories, as well as in communities internationally"". It added: ""Ai Weiwei is well-known for his support of freedom of expression and for championing the oppressed, and we deeply respect and value our longstanding relationship with him."" Ai Weiwei is a contemporary artist, documentarian and activist who found global prominence after being openly critical of the Chinese government's stance on democracy and human rights. He was born in Beijing in 1957, and grew up in labour camps in the north-west of China after his father, Ai Qing, an anti-establishment poet, was exiled. In 2011, he was arrested in Beijing for ""economic crimes"", and detained for 81 days without charge. Ai is one of China's most vocal political commentators and makes use of Chinese art forms to display political and social issues. He is also a well known advocate for human rights and has vocally expressed support for the Palestinian people. In 2016 he filmed a documentary, Human Flow, in Gaza about the global refugee crisis.",2023-11-15T19:18:06.000Z

Keir Starmer set for showdown with Labour MPs over Gaza stancePublished15 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Sir Keir Starmer is set for a showdown with Labour MPs later over the party's position on the Israel-Hamas war. Dozens could back a Commons motion from the SNP calling for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict, in contrast to the Labour leader. Labour has ordered its MPs to abstain on the SNP's motion, meaning frontbenchers must resign or face the sack to support it. But three frontbenchers have already indicated they will defy their leader. Shadow Home Office minister Naz Shah, shadow education minister Helen Hayes and shadow trade minister Afzal Khan all told MPs they wanted to support an immediate ceasefire. The party has tabled its motion urging longer pauses in the fighting to deliver aid, which, along with the SNP motion, will be voted on after 19.00 GMT. Nineteen frontbenchers have expressed an opinion on the conflict at odds with their leader. One, shadow minister Imran Hussain,quit his position last weekin order to campaign for an immediate ceasefire. Speaking ahead of the vote, he said humanitarian pauses - as advocated by Labour's leader - do not ""go far enough,"" adding that a ceasefire would ""create space for meaningful negotiations"". Nearly 70 Labour MPs have defied their leader to call for a ceasefire now, and nearly 50 councillors have resigned from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Sir Keir has argued that a ceasefire would not be appropriate, because it would freeze the conflict and embolden Hamas. Instead, Labour, like the Conservative government, the United States and the European Union, is calling for ""humanitarian pauses"" to help aid reach Gaza. Compared with a formal ceasefire, these pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours. They are implemented with the aim of providing humanitarian support only, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions. Last week, the US said Israel would begin to implementdaily four-hour military pausesin areas of northern Gaza. The competing motions on the conflict come in the form of amendments to the King's Speech, the government's legislative programme for the year ahead unveiled last week. Labour's motion would support Israel's right to self-defence after Hamas's ""horrific terrorist attack"" on 7 October, in which 1,200 people were killed, and call for the release of more than 200 people taken hostage. But it also says there has been ""too much suffering, including far too many deaths of innocent civilians and children"" since Israel began striking Gaza in response. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then - of whom more than 4,500 were children. The amendment calls on Israel to ""protect hospitals and lift the siege conditions"" on the territory, and urges longer humanitarian pauses to allow aid ""on a scale that begins to meet the desperate needs of the people of Gaza"". It says this is a ""necessary step to an enduring cessation of fighting as soon as possible and a credible, diplomatic and political process to deliver the lasting peace of a two-state solution"". Labour has confirmed that its MPs will be under a three-line whip - the strictest instruction - to back the party's motion, and abstain on the competing SNP motion calling on ""all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire"". ""This is a whipped vote and every MP knows what the consequence of that means,"" a spokesman added. Supporters of Sir Keir's position hope the gambit of tabling its own motion could mean most resignations are avoided. However, they concede that the question of backing a ceasefire has become the central issue for some of the MPs.",2023-11-15T17:36:05.000Z

First fuel tanker enters Gaza from Egypt since start of warPublished15 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A tanker has delivered fuel to Gaza for the first time since the war between Hamas and Israel began five weeks ago. A senior UN official said it had received 23,000 litres (5,060 gallons) of fuel via Egypt's Rafah crossing. But he warned that Israeli authorities had restricted its use to transporting aid into Gaza, and that none could be used to power hospitals or water pumps. Israel has been blocking all deliveries of fuel, saying it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes. An Israeli defence ministry body said it had agreed to allow UN aid lorries to be refuelled following a request from the US government. The decision came hours after Israeli troops raided Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, which has been the focus of days of fighting and seen nearby air strikes. Israel launched a major military campaign to destroy Hamas - which it classes as a terrorist group - and began a siege of Gaza in retaliation for a cross-border attack by hundreds of gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,000 people have been killed in the territory since then and the UN has warned of a ""humanitarian disaster"". The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - which runs the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza - said on Tuesday that the lack of fuel meant it could no longer unload or distribute aid from lorries that arrived at Rafah. Although Wednesday's delivery means the UN will now be able to fill up its vehicles, Israel has banned it from using any of the fuel to provide basic services to 1.5 million people who have fled their homes, more than half of which are sheltering in Unrwa facilities. ""Our entire operation is now on the verge of collapse,""Unrwa's Commissioner General, Philippe Lazzarini, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""By the end of today, around 70% of the population in Gaza won't have access to clean water,"" he added. ""To have fuel for trucks only will not save lives anymore. Waiting longer will cost lives."" The agency's Gaza chief, Thomas White, said 23,000 litres represented only 9% of what it needed daily to sustain life-saving activities and demanded that aid ""be delivered based upon need - not based upon conditions set by parties to a conflict"". Earlier, Mr White said all three sewage pumps and 10 water pumps in the southern town of Rafah had stopped working because they had run out of fuel, as had the desalinisation plant in the nearby city of Khan Younis. Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis has also been forced to halt all services except for emergencies and 24 ambulances have been taken out of service. Many other health, water and sanitation facilities have already been forced to shut down across the Strip due to lack of fuel, damage, attacks and insecurity. Palestinian telecommunications firms have also said that they expect to switch off phone and internet services on Thursday due to a lack of fuel for data centres and exchanges, according to the UN. The Netblocks internet observatory said on Wednesday thatmetrics showed a new gradual decline in internet connectivity in Gazaand that residents' ability to communicate was likely to be reduced. On Tuesday, 91 lorries carrying food, medicines, health supplies, bottled water, blankets, tents and hygiene products entered Gaza from Egypt,the UN said, bringing the total since the Rafah crossing reopened on 21 October to 1,187. The UN has described that as a ""drop in the ocean"", noting that about 500 lorries would cross into Gaza each day on average before the war began.",2023-11-15T13:36:25.000Z

Bowen: Al-Shifa Hospital raid comes as tone shifts on IsraelPublished15 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Al-Shifa is the main hospital in Gaza City - I've been there many times. It has big grounds, so people in Gaza went there to seek shelter and camp out as they saw it as a safe area. It has now become a symbol of the juxtaposition of the war - the Israeli invasion of Gaza inflicting masses of casualties and damage, set against the crisis of urgent humanitarian need inside the hospital. The Israelis have made a very big point about saying that, as well as going after the Hamas military command, they have brought in some fuel and incubators, because there has been a very concerning claim that premature babies in Al-Shifa Hospital had to be taken out of their incubators. However, the issue isn't a lack of incubators, it's a lack of fuel. Until Wednesday, Israel hadn't allow fuel into the Gaza Strip because they argued that Hamas would steal it and use it. Some 23,000 litres (5,060 gallons) of fuel has now been allowed in, but it is only to be used to refuel UN lorries. The UN says the delivery comprises only a fraction of what's needed for humanitarian operations, and the entry of fuel to run generators at hospitals and at water and sanitation facilities remains banned. Israel says Hamas has stockpiles of its own, and that it should use that fuel for the generators supplying the hospital electrical system. So there are a lot of strands coming together in what's unfolding in Al-Shifa Hospital this morning, but that's not the whole war - it will continue once this particular operation is over. At the same time, we have seen a hardening of the international position around the Israeli offensive in the last few days with the US, the UK and France using language that is shifting the tone - perhaps summed up best by what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last weekend: ""Far too many"" Palestinian civilians have been killed. The Israelis knew this shift would come because this is a repeat of the pattern we have seen many times before with Israel's military operations. They talk about different clocks running during any operation. One is military: how long do they need before they accomplish their military objectives? The other is diplomatic: how long does Israel hold legitimacy to carry out that operation before its allies say, ""you've killed enough people, civilians, you need to stop now please."" Israel feels that because of the absolute enormity of the numbers of casualties in the Hamas attacks on 7 October, they have more time than usual, and I think they have gone in - as we can see from the levels of casualties in Gaza - using a great deal of force. I have seen some estimates that suggest the Israel Defense Forces will continue to work in this way for a couple more weeks, but I think the forces are gathering among their allies to say you need to change the nature of your military operation. That doesn't necessarily translate to a call for this to stop - certainly we haven't yet heard a call for a ceasefire from the British or the Americans.",2023-11-15T12:59:28.000Z

Gaza vote sees Natasha Asghar targeted at Cardiff UniversityPublished15 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A politician had protesters chant ""shame on you"" and ""you support genocide"" as she spoke in front of students. Natasha Asghar,Member of the Seneddfor South East Wales, was talking to Cardiff University's politics society when a group began banging the door. Ms Asghar, along with other Tory and Labour politicians,did not support calls for a ceasefirein Gaza. A Cardiff University spokesman said it was reviewing what happened on Monday. ""Despite repeated attempts to explain my point of view following last week's vote, and answer their questions, many of the protestors simply would not listen and engage and instead continued disrupting the event because they didn't like my answers,"" Ms Asghar said in a statement. ""I am not prepared to be bullied and intimidated into not attending important events like these and I would like to say a huge thank you to my team, the police and the university's security team for keeping me safe."" Avideo posted on X, formerly Twitter, shows Ms Asghar talking about the demise of HS2 and funding for transport routes in north Wales, when protesters begin banging the door and shouting. It follows a motion in the Welsh Parliament last week where Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said both Hamas' attacks on Israel and the ""collective punishment"" of Gaza were unjust and inhumane. His call for a ceasefire in Gaza  was backed by a total of 24 MSs, while 19 voted against. The Welsh Conservative group and four Labour members opposed the ceasefire calls. Ms Asghar said, while she accepted people had the right to protest, the scenes at the university were ""totally unacceptable"". She said: ""Chanting all sorts of hateful messages, including calling me a murderer, ramming doors to try and gain access to the room I was in, and pounding on the walls from start to finish is absolutely uncalled for."" Adam Johannes from campaign group Cardiff Stop the War Coalition said: ""Polls show that the majority of people in Britain favour an immediate ceasefire, but the majority of politicians want the slaughter to continue."" He said there was ""anger and pain and trauma"" at Ms Asghar's vote in the Senedd, adding: ""Students picketed the meeting outside to show the level of anger, many also attended the talk to challenge the Tory politician."" Cardiff Students' Union said it was dedicated to providing a space where students could engage in discussions, express their opinions and advocate for change. It said union leaders attended the event to ensure it could go ahead and protesters could express their opinion. Cardiff University said security staff were also there and it went ahead with ""minimal disruption"" but would review the events and ""adapt our procedures, if necessary"". It added: ""It is important to stress that universities are places where a range of ideas can be considered, examined and dissected both in academic programmes and in the wider university life. ""This means differing views can be brought forward and listened to. As a result, we will continue to take all reasonable steps to ensure that - within the law - freedom of speech is secured on our campus."" South Wales Police said officers attended after reports of a protest, but no arrests were made.",2023-11-15T12:58:41.000Z

Israel Gaza war: History of the conflict explainedPublished15 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip. About 1,200 people were killed, while the Israeli military says more than 200 soldiers and civilians, including women and children, were taken to Gaza as hostages. More than 14,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Britain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a ""national home"" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community. The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922. To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move. Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two. Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased. In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented. In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel. It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews. Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, orthe ""Catastrophe"" By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East. Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades. In a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula. Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state. Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital. In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live. Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this. Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt. Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth. In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years. Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel. There are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: Israel-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence. A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton. In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up. Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal. The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995. In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington. The mostrecent peace plan - prepared by the USwhen Donald Trump was president - was called ""the deal of the century"" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground. Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries. Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment. This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis. These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack. But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons. The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel. The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war. Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East. Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack. Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however,denied any involvement.",2023-11-15T11:22:33.000Z

Hostages' fates haunt Israel as war intensifiesPublished15 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Their smiling faces look down from the sides of skyscrapers, walls between Tel Aviv's restaurants and bars and a giant video screen at a shopping mall entrance. More than 240 hostages were snatched at gunpoint on 7 October from their homes or workplaces next to the Gaza Strip, from military bases and a big outdoor dance party. They included some 30 children, the youngest just nine months old. But since Hamas gunmen spirited them away to Gaza, the fates of most remain unknown. For Israelis reeling from last month's bloody massacres, it is an ongoing trauma. ""This is the last photo we have of my aunt. She was taken on a motorcycle by two terrorists,"" says Eyal Nouri, showing me a picture of Amina Moshe, 72, being driven away from Nir Oz, a kibbutz where she lived for 50 years. ""No children, no babies, no older women are meant to be part of any conflict. It's something against humanity to kidnap children."" Although this is the biggest, over the years, Israel has endured many hostage crises. During the 1980s, the country showed it was ready to pay high prices for its citizens in prisoner swaps with Palestinian and Lebanese armed groups. Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, who later founded Hamas, was freed in one exchange. Even Israeli soldiers' corpses were traded to give them proper Jewish burials. Then in 2006, Hamas kidnapped a soldier, 19-year-old Gilad Shalit, in a cross-border raid. His father, Noam, led a painful five-year campaign to bring him home, stressing the ""unwritten contract"" between the state and its conscripts. Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister - then as now - signed off on the biggest ever prisoner exchange for a single soldier. More than a thousand inmates were released including Yahya Sinwar, who went on to lead Hamas in Gaza, and apparently masterminded the 7 October attacks. A key figure involved in the Shalit deal sees major differences between the circumstances then and now which he thinks will prevent any comprehensive deal being done. ""We had five years and four months to build trust with Gilad Shalit. [Now], we have days. The future of the hostages will be decided in the coming days,"" says Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist, who led secret backchannel talks with Hamas. The main complication this time, he says, is the scale of atrocities.  ""What Hamas did, they crossed the line, where it's inconceivable that they will continue to be in power in Gaza after this war is over,"" Mr Baskin says. ""So, there's some kind of built in contradiction to trying to negotiate with the people that you intend on killing."" Early on, Qatar did broker the release of an American Israeli mother and daughter and Egypt helped bring out two older Israeli women hostages. However, no bigger agreement has since taken shape. This week, the military wing of Hamas said it was ready to free up to 70 women and children held in Gaza in exchange for a five-day ceasefire. Speaking to the US network, NBC on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu raised the possibility of a deal. The US President Joe Biden has since said he is engaged in daily discussion to secure the release of the hostages and believes it will happen. However, publicly, Israel has rejected a ceasefire, arguing that Hamas would use it to regroup. It has said it could agree to shorter humanitarian pauses in hostilities. Polls suggest that position is supported by many Israelis. In the latest survey by the Israeli Democracy Institute, the most common response - from 38% of people - was that Israel should negotiate a prisoner deal but continue fighting. Overall, 70% of respondents did not think the war should stop. ""In return for the hostages they are ready to give Palestinian prisoners. But the popular view is to say: ""don't stop the fighting,"""" says Professor Tamar Hartmann who conducted the poll. ""It's because the cost of stopping the fighting right now might be greater in terms of people's lives, if we stop and the aims of the war will not be achieved."" A persistent small group of those polled - about a fifth - refuse any deal making with Hamas. Many Israelis point out how in the past, prisoners - like Yahya Sinwar - who already had blood on their hands were released and went on to plot further deadly attacks. With the odds against them, families and supporters of the hostages are coming up with creative ways of raising public pressure. A huge art installation filling HaBima Square in Tel Aviv features an empty bed for every adult, child and couple missing in Gaza. Every Friday on the Jewish sabbath, relatives gather in what is now known as Hostages Square outside the Museum of Art. They set up a giant table with places set for every person missing. On Tuesday, a large crowd began a 40 mile (63 km) march from Tel Aviv to the prime minister's office in Jerusalem to urge their government to take action. With each passing day, fears grow for the hostages. Hamas says several dozen have already been killed in Israeli air strikes. Past experience has taught Israelis that deals can be done but now the intensity of the ongoing war brings a new level of urgency.",2023-11-15T06:00:01.000Z

US evangelicals drive Republican support for IsraelPublished15 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Republican support for Israel has been near monolithic since the 7 October attack by Hamas. Conservatives argue the US is backing a close ally, standing up for the region's only democracy and sending a message that terror against civilians will not be tolerated. But there's more to it than that. Evangelical conservatives are a key part of the Republican party's coalition, and these religious voters - and politicians - have a connection to the state of Israel that runs deep. George Washington University religious scholar Christopher Rollston says: ""There's a strong sense within evangelicalism that the Jewish people are God's people. ""And there's a theological assumption that's pretty pervasive within certain segments of evangelicalism that the establishment of the modern state of Israel was the fulfilment of biblical prophecy."" The new Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, has strong evangelical ties. The Louisiana congressman was one of a handful of politicians who addressed a crowd organisers estimated as being in the hundreds of thousands at a ""March for Israel"" event in Washington DC on Tuesday. Quoting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he called the conflict between Israel and Hamas ""a fight between good and evil, between light and darkness, between civilisation and barbarism"". He said demands for an Israeli ceasefire in Gaza were ""outrageous"". ""It is my hope that this gathering today serves as a reminder to the entire world, but also to those within our own borders, that the United States stands proudly with Israel and the Jewish people forever,"" he said. Mr Johnson stood on a stage bedecked with dozens of Israeli and American flags, the US Capitol in the background. Two senior Democrats, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, joined him, along with Republican Senator Joni Ernst. They raised their hands together and led the audience in a chant of ""we stand with Israel"". ""There are few issues in Washington that could so easily bring together leaders of both parties in both chambers,"" Mr Johnson said, ""but the survival of the state of Israel unites us together and unites all Americans."" The Democrats are divided, however. While the two congressional leaders, along with President Joe Biden, have been firm in their support for Israel following the attack, a growing number on the left are calling attention to Palestinian civilian casualties and condemning the Israeli military campaign. With the exception of a handful of Republican politicians, however, dissent on the right has been missing. When a standalone bill providing $14.3bn (£11.5bn) in US aid to Israel was introduced in the House of Representatives, only two Republicans - Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky - voted no. Their isolated opposition is a far cry from the significant and growing number of Republicans who oppose continued US support for Ukraine, the world's other current major international conflict. The influence of an evangelical leader invited to speak towards the end of the March for Israel's programme helps explain why Israel is treated differently by Republicans. John Hagee is a Texas-based Christian minister and president of Christians United for Israel, which boasts 10 million members. In 2008, he said the Holocaust was part of God's plan to return Jews to Israel. The Republican presidential candidate at the time, John McCain, declined his endorsement in part because of those comments. The organisers of Tuesday's march, the Jewish Federations of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, invited Mr Hagee to speak at their rally, however, as a part of a ""voices of allies"" segment. The organisers did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment. For his part, Mr Hagee was effusive in his support for Israel. He told the crowd that a line should be drawn uniting Christians and Jews and that there was no ""middle"" ground in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. ""We must all stand united with one voice and boldly declare over and over: Israel, you are not alone,"" he said. In his deep southern preacher drawl, he placed the fate of Israel squarely in a religious context. ""The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob guarantees Israel's deliverance will come as proclaimed every year during Passover,"" he said. ""Israel is the apple of God's eye. Israel is the shining city on the hill. God says of Israel, Israel is my firstborn son."" For some evangelicals, however, the ties between their religion and the fate of Israel have a darker hue. And it's where Mr Hagee's more controversial views come into play. In the End Days, a certain strain of Christian theology holds, the Jewish people will either convert to Christianity or perish in flames. It is a key step towards Armageddon that is then followed by 1,000 years of peace, according to this belief. A Pew Research survey last year found 39% of Americans - including 63% of evangelicals - believe humanity is ""living in the end times"". And for the moment - on the stage in Washington on Tuesday and in the halls of Congress - the interests of Israel, Republicans and evangelicals are in alignment.",2023-11-15T03:10:43.000Z

Israeli-Canadian peace advocate Vivian Silver confirmed killed in Hamas attackPublished15 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An Israeli-Canadian peace advocate, feared to have been taken hostage in Gaza, has been confirmed killed. Vivian Silver, 74, lived close to Israel's border with Gaza in kibbutz Be'eri - which was attacked by Hamas during the 7 October attacks. Remains had been found earlier at her house, but they were only formally identified as hers five weeks later. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly described Ms Silver as a ""lifelong advocate for peace"". ""Canada mourns her loss,"" she wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Ms Silver, born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was one of Israel's best known advocates for peace with the Palestinians. Her movement, Women Wage Peace, was established to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to reach a peace agreement to end the Arab-Israeli conflict. Her son Yonatan Zeigen told the BBC she stayed busy in her retirement, continuing her life's work as an activist, holding meetings just days before the Hamas attacks. Her family had believed she had been kidnapped by Hamas and held in Gaza for the past five weeks. Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation last week, Mr Zeigen said that while they knew Ms Silver's house had been burned to the ground during Hamas's attack, and that a body had been found at that time, there was ""no evidence there of a struggle or bullets"", leading the family to believe she had been kidnapped. In an interview with the BBC in the days after the attack, Mr Zeigen recounted his final communications with her as she hid in a cupboard while armed men were moving through the kibbutz. He said his mother told him that she loved him, and said ""'they're inside the house, it's time to stop joking and say goodbye.'"" ""I wrote back that 'I love you, Mum. I have no words, I'm with you,'"" he said. ""Then she writes, 'I feel you.' And then that was it, that's the last message."" Asked what his mother would have said about everything that has happened, Mr Yonatan said: ""That this is the outcome of war. Of not striving for peace, and this is what happens."" ""It's very overwhelming but not completely surprising. It's not sustainable to live in a state of war for so long and now it bursts. It bursts."" Gershon Baskin, a friend of Silver's, remembered her as a ""happy, optimistic person"". ""She was a person who lit up a room whenever she came in,"" he toldCBC. ""She had a moral compass that led the direction of many people who followed her."" More than 100 members of Ms Silver's kibbutz were killed in the attack. There have beengrowing calls for a humanitarian pauseto allow aid into Gaza, and to help get out some of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas. Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu has said all hostages must be released before any temporary truce can be agreed. Israel began striking Gaza after Hamas's surprise attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since.",2023-11-15T01:44:11.000Z

Israel-Gaza war: US says Hamas has command centre under Al-Shifa hospitalPublished14 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The US says it has intelligence that Hamas has a command centre under Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. National Security spokesman John Kirby said the group stored arms there and were prepared for an Israeli attack. This is the first time the US has independently backed claims by close ally Israel that Hamas uses hospitals to hide its bases. Hamas denies this. The statement came as Israel faced mounting global pressure to protect civilians trapped in the hospitals. US President Joe Biden said that Al-Shifa hospital ""must be protected"" from intense fighting around the complex, and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Israel must act within international law. The area around Al-Shifa, Gaza's biggest hospital, has become the focus of fighting in recent days. Thousands of people are believed to be sheltering there. Mr Kirby said the US had its own intelligence, which had come from a variety of sources, suggesting that Hamas and Islamic Jihad used hospitals in the Gaza Strip and tunnels underneath them to conceal military operations and hold hostages. Previously the US administration had only cited open-source intelligence and would not confirm that it had its own sources for this. ""Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members operate a command and control node from Al-Shifa in Gaza City,"" he said. ""They have stored weapons there and they are prepared to respond to an Israeli military operation against that facility."" Mr Kirby said this showed how challenging the Israeli operation was as ""Hamas has deeply embedded itself within the civilian population"". ""To be clear, we do not support striking a hospital from the air and we do not want to see a firefight in the hospital where innocent people, helpless people, sick people are simply trying to get the medical care that they deserve, not to be caught in a crossfire. Hospitals and patients must be protected,"" he said. ""As we have been clear on multiple occasions, Hamas's actions do not lessen Israel's responsibility to protect civilians in Gaza, and this is obviously something we're going to have an active conversation with our counterparts about."" Responding to the White House's remarks on Tuesday, Hamas said in a statement reported by the AFP news agency that Israel would use Washington's assessment to give it a ""green light"" to commit ""brutal massacres"" against medical facilities, ""destroying Gaza's healthcare system and displacing Palestinians"". Doctors inside Al-Shifa say that dozens of people, including at least three premature babies, have died due to a lack of fuel, medicine and power. They have told the BBC that more than 100 bodies lay unburied in courtyards, and anyone trying to leave the complex - or even move between buildings - risks death due to the violence in the area. Israel maintains that it has not fired directly on hospitals in Gaza despite what it says is Hamas's presence in them. The Israeli military has vowed to destroy Hamas, a designated terror group in the US, UK and EU, in the Gaza Strip. On Monday Israel released video of what it said was a Hamas hideout under the Rantisi children's hospital in northern Gaza City. In asix-minute video marked as ""raw footage"", the IDF's chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari is seen saying he is at a tunnel 200 metres away from Rantisi. In the video, Hagari points to the tunnel entrance, which he says he believes is ""connected"" to the hospital, and electrical wiring he says proved solar panels had been powering a bunker. No further evidence is provided for the existence of a command centre but the IDF spokesman said investigations were continuing. The footage then cuts to basement rooms he says are inside Rantisi hospital. He points to a cache of weapons, including explosive belts and grenades, and a motorcycle with what he says is bullet damage. Rear Adm Hagari says there are signs that hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the group's attack on Israel had been held in the basement. A shot shows a chair with what appears to be rope ties, below a control panel marked ""World Health Organization"" with a child's feeding bottle resting on top. In another room, he points to a calendar on the wall counting the days in Arabic from 7 October - the date of Hamas's attack into southern Israel. Rear Adm Hagari claims the calendar shows the ""terrorists' shifts"" as they guarded the room. He says names were written alongside shift times. The top of this document mentions the ""al-Aqsa flood"" - Hamas's codename for the 7 October attacks. However, the Arabic words translate to the days of the week, not names. He separately states that the room is decorated with curtains like a video studio. Of the hostage videos released by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, none have shown a matching pattern in the background. The IDF escorted CNN journalists around the site and the hospital, which was evacuated on Friday. BBC News has not visited the site and is not able to independently verify any of the allegations made by Hagari. However, the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza responded in detail to the Israeli claims, describing them as a ""theatrical farce"". It said the underground space shown in the video was used for administration and storage, and as a shelter from air strikes. It described the display of weapons as staged, and said there were thousands of similar motorcycles in Gaza. The ministry says that more than 11,000 people have been killed in Israel's operations against Hamas, since the group killed 1,200 people in Israel on 7 October and took about 240 people hostage.

"British man killed by Hamas was due to leave kibbutz, brother saysPublished14 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","A British man killed in a Hamas attack on an Israeli kibbutz was meant to have left but stayed ""one more day"" in a place he considered a ""little piece of heaven"", his brother has said. Daniel Darlington, 34, originally from Manchester, was killed at the Nir Oz kibbutz in the 7 October massacre. His brother Lior Peri told the BBC Mr Darlington was an ""amazing free sprit"" who was the ""cool uncle"" in his family. He said his focus now was to bring his 79-year-old hostage father home. The UK government has confirmed 12 British nationals were killed in Hamas's attack last month. A further three are missing. Mr Darlington, a photographer, had been living in Berlin and was visiting friends in Israel when Hamas struck. Mr Peri said it was by ""complete chance"" his half-brother was in the kibbutz when Hamas arrived. He said: ""He stayed in the kibbutz one more day. ""He was supposed to come back to us in Tel Aviv and he was so happy to announce to me that he found a ride the next day so he could stay one more day in this little piece of heaven he liked so much. ""That's where it ended unfortunately."" Mr Peri said his father Haim, a lifelong peace activist, was among those taken hostage in the attack. ""He has been a farmer all his life and an enthusiastic peace activist,"" he said. ""I get my hope from the belief that I will see my father alive and well again. It's the only thing keeping me and all of us up and running,"" he said. Mr Peri said the operation to rescue the hostages now needed to be the ""first priority"". ""We've started calling more on the Israeli government to persuade us that they are doing whatever they can to release the hostages, since we don't really have the confidence that they are doing whatever is needed,"" he said. ""They are continuing the ground invasion. We can't know if this pressure applying on Hamas is helping us in the hostage situation or is it pushing us further away."" More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Forty-six Israeli soldiers have been killed, the Israel Defence Force has said.

Arab and Muslim leaders blame West for Gaza miseryPublished14 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hypocrisy, double standards and a failure to understand the region. These are the charges being levelled at the West, primarily the US, by leaders of 57 Arab and Muslim countries who convened at the weekend in the Saudi capital Riyadh. How is it, foreign ministers said to me, that the West slams Russia for killing civilians in Ukraine, yet, in their words, it ""gives a green light to Israel to do the same in Gaza""? In the luxurious surroundings of Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel, amid giant floral bouquets and glittering chandeliers, and a world away from the shattered landscape of Gaza, princes, presidents and prime ministers met for the Joint Arab Islamic Extraordinary Summit. Blame for the war and the destruction of lives and property was heaped unilaterally on Israel and its supporters. No-one criticised Hamas for its 7 October raid into southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw some 240 taken hostage, triggering the massive military retaliation. Israel, said the secretary general of the Arab League, had committed criminal acts. ""We warn of the disastrous repercussions of the retaliatory aggression by Israel against the Gaza Strip, which amounts to a war crime,"" said the final communique. ""We warn of the real danger of the expansion of the war as a result of Israel's refusal to stop its aggression and of the inability of the [UN] Security Council to enforce international law to end this aggression."" Few people I spoke to at the summit expected Israel to take much notice. Instead, it was clear that this summit and its intended message of unity was aimed at Israel's biggest backer - the United States. Leaders want the Biden administration and the West in general to exert sufficient pressure on Israel to stop the war altogether. But what they could not agree on was how to achieve that. The summit pulled together some strange bedfellows - an indication of just how worried the region is at events in Gaza spiralling beyond their control. Iran - Israel's main adversary - attended, with President Ebrahim Raisi striding across the carpeted halls in his black, cleric's robes, flanked by his scowling security men in dark suits and collarless shirts. This in itself was a surprising sight. Until they patched over their differences in March this year, Saudi Arabia and Iran were arch rivals exchanging venomous mutual accusations. They still have competing agendas, with Iran backing what many call its ""proxy militias"" - Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. The Saudis, together with their conservative Arab allies like Egypt and Jordan, see these movements as dangerous destabilisers. As he departed Tehran airport for Riyadh, President Raisi said that now was the time for action over Gaza, not words. But anyone expecting concrete, punitive actions against the US or the UK was left disappointed. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which only recently opened full diplomatic, trade and security ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, resisted calls to break them off. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad was also at the summit. Until very recently he was a pariah in the Arab world for the repressive actions of his regime in Syria's civil war. He told the summit it would achieve little without concrete measures, but suggestions of an oil embargo or the expulsion of US bases from Arab countries were quietly batted away. Yet there is no denying that the 7 October Hamas raid and the ensuing war has changed the whole paradigm in the Middle East. Up until that murderous morning in southern Israel the tectonic plates of regional politics were shifting away from the interests of Iran and its militant allies. Six Arab nations had already established full ties with Israel; Saudi Arabia was well on the way to being next. The Israeli tourism minister visited Riyadh just days before the Hamas raid. Dubai has been luring Israeli tourists in large numbers and there has been a huge Arab appetite for Israel's expertise in technology, surveillance, bio-tech and other sectors. With the exception of Qatar, which hosts the exiled political leaders of Hamas, Gulf Arab rulers had grown tired of what they saw as the corruption, inefficiency and infighting of Palestinian leadership. While sympathetic to the plight of ordinary Palestinians, still without a state after 75 years, they largely took the view that Israel was too important a nation to ignore, and that it was time to move on and normalise ties with it. The question of a future Palestinian state, while still featuring in speeches, was getting little practical attention. Today, those Arab-Israeli ties, while not yet broken, are certainly fraying at the edges. ""We are really worried about the radicalisation of our youth,"" one Arab foreign minister told me on background. ""They watch what is happening in Gaza on TV and they are increasingly angry."" Time and again I heard delegates complain that the actions of the Netanyahu government have gone far beyond self-defence and are now dragging the region down a dangerous path. There are concerns that extremist narratives are gaining popularity online. Arab and Muslim leaders are frustrated that the UN Security Council has failed in their eyes to exercise any restraint on Israel's military in Gaza. America's opposition to a ceasefire has deeply embarrassed those countries it calls allies in the region. Washington's strategic alliance with the oil-rich Gulf Arab states dates back to 1945 and a wartime meeting on a US warship in the Red Sea between President Roosevelt and the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz. Today, the US still provides the bulk of Saudi and Gulf Arab defence and security needs. But below the surface things are changing. Ever since the Obama administration's ""pivot to Asia"" there has been a fear here in the Gulf that the US is losing interest in the region, that it cannot be relied upon as a loyal partner. At the same time, the influences of Moscow and Beijing are in the ascendant. China recently brokered the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. President Putin has impressed Arab leaders with his unstinting support for Syria's President Assad. They compare this with how quickly Washington abandoned Egypt's President Mubarak in 2011 when the crowds came out on Cairo's Tahrir Square. None of this means the West has lost the friends it had in the Middle East. Those Arab allies are clearly reluctant to go beyond angry words with Washington. But they do want to be heard and for the violence in Gaza to stop now, before events in the region and in their own countries risk deteriorating far beyond their control.",2023-11-14T16:12:43.000Z

Giving birth with no painkillers under the bombs in GazaPublished14 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"""My child doesn't have a name yet because of the war. She's four days old,"" says Kefaia Abu Asser. Sitting on a straw mat in a corner of a school shelter run by the UN in Rafah, in southern Gaza, Kefaia cradles her baby daughter, who is wrapped in a red blanket. Stress and exhaustion are visible on her face. Being a first-time mother is hard anywhere in the world, but Kefaia had to do it under unimaginable trauma. Originally from northern Gaza, the 24-year-old fled her home with her family after the Israeli military warned civilians to move to the south of the Strip for their safety. Kefaia was heavily pregnant. ""I had to run and flee from one place to another. I was utterly exhausted. Initially we went to the Nuseirat Camp. But there was a bombing close to us. I saw bodies that had been ripped apart. It was extremely difficult,"" she tells a freelance journalist working in Gaza for the BBC. Kefaia and her family are among the hundreds of thousands who have fled northern Gaza and, like many others, she had to walk for miles, all the while worried about being bombed. ""It was so dangerous for my unborn child. I was scared all the time,"" she says. The family finally reached the Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah city but its maternity ward had been closed down. Kefaia was then moved to the nearby Emirati Hospital. ""It was very hard because the number of women giving birth was huge,"" she says. ""They were coming from all parts of Gaza, from the north to the south and everywhere in between."" ""There was a shortage of painkillers,"" she adds. ""So they only administered it if the pain became really unbearable and only to those most in need."" She gave birth with no painkillers. The World Health Organization (WHO) says more than half the hospitals in Gaza are not functioning due to lack of fuel, damage, attacks and insecurity. The UN estimates that around 50,000 pregnant women have been caught up in the conflict, and despite the state of hospitals, roughly 180 deliveries are expected to take place each day. Many pregnant women have been cut off from safe delivery services as hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties, out of fuel for generators, and lacking medicines and basic supplies - including for the management of obstetric emergencies. Ola Abu Oali was one of them. ""My baby is two weeks old. He was born during the war, right here in this school,"" she tells Majdi Fathi, a freelance journalist working for the BBC in Gaza. Ola has another young son. They are all currently living in a different overcrowded UN school shelter in Rafah. ""Both my children are getting sick. Their stomachs are bloating and they have severe diarrhoea. Every time I breastfeed my baby, he vomits. I've had to take my other child to the hospital three times to put him on a drip, but his condition has not changed,"" she says. Access to clean water is one of the biggest challenges for the displaced in Gaza. The UN says each person has access to only three litres of water a day for all their needs. ""We don't have any water. There is no milk for my baby. And the condition of the toilets is unbearable. There is a stench and we have to wait our turn to use it,"" Ola says. Wafaa Yousef Fakhry Ahmed is sheltering in the same school as Ola. ""I'm pregnant. I fear for my child's life. I'm approaching my due date and I'm worried about the environment I'm living in, about getting diseases. We don't have water for basic cleanliness, "" she says. Wafaa is from Beit Hanoun, near Gaza's northern border, and has also moved from place to place in search of safety. ""First, we went to a school in the Al-Muaskar area. We were asked to leave there too, so we came further south. We used carts and donkeys on some part of the way. But most of it, we walked, "" she says. ""We had no water with us to drink, so the only option we had was to drink from the sea. My husband was trying so hard to get one bottle for us to drink from."" The WHO says maternal deaths are expected to increase in Gaza given the lack of access to adequate care. It says the hostilities have direct and deadly consequences for pregnancies, with a rise in stress-induced miscarriages, stillbirths and premature births. Asma is from Gaza City but is now living with her three young children in a tent in the compound of the Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza. She's pregnant and before she was forced to flee her home, she had gone to the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City for a check-up. ""Due to the constant sound of bombings, many women suffered miscarriages at Al-Shifa. The situation is unbearable, especially for pregnant mothers. I'm really worried about my baby and about having a miscarriage,"" Asma says. ""Waking up with aching bones has become a daily reality. We're exposed to unsanitary conditions. And we've repeatedly witnessed distressing sights of dead bodies."" Asma says she's exhausted and wants the fighting to stop. ""I plead for a ceasefire. What is the fault of the children that they have to suffer this much? What is the fault of my baby who hasn't come to life yet?""

Israel confirms death of soldier held hostage in GazaPublished14 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Israeli military has confirmed the death of a soldier abducted by Hamas and held in Gaza following the group's massive attack on Israel on 7 October. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had informed 19-year-old Corporal Noa Marciano's family of her death. Cpl Marciano had appeared in a video released by Hamas on Monday. The IDF called it ""psychological terrorism"". She was one of about 240 hostages taken by Hamas gunmen during last month's attack, which killed 1,200 people. Cpl Marciano was serving as a lookout at the Nahal Oz kibbutz when it was stormed by part of a wave of gunmen who had burst through the nearby Israel-Gaza border, attacking dozens of Israeli communities, several military bases and hundreds of young people attending a music festival. As with all the hostages, Cpl Marciano's whereabouts in Gaza had not been known. Hamas's military wing claimed Cpl Marciano was killed in an Israeli air strike on 9 November, though this could not be independently verified. Following the 7 October attack, Israel launched a war against Hamas - proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, including the UK. More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Forty-six Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting inside Gaza over the same period, the IDF says. Since 7 October, Hamas has released four hostages and the IDF has rescued one.",2023-11-14T11:44:15.000Z

Blackpool family who fled Gaza fear for those left behindPublished14 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A British family who fled Gaza with only a small suitcase between six of them have said they do not know what the future now holds and they fear for the lives of those left behind. Emad Abuaassi and his wife Stephanie moved to Gaza from Blackpool a year ago, to be closer to his family. After the conflict began they left their flat in the middle of the night. They crossed the border into Egypt on 3 November and flew back to the UK but do not have anywhere permanent to live. Emad Abuassi said their family home in northern Gaza had been completely destroyed and he was worried for the safety of his mother, brothers and sisters in southern Gaza. ""This is the saddest moment I have been across in my whole life,"" he said. ""When I left the border I was looking behind me like just measuring who's going to be alive and who's going to have died after all this. ""Everybody's life there is in danger. ""Could be my mom passed away tomorrow, my brother, my cousin, my neighbour my friend."" He and his wife and four children have been housed in emergency hotel accommodation in Cardiff and are waiting to hear about temporary housing. They are anxious for the children to resume schooling, after their education came to an abrupt end on 7 October. They also need medical aid, as Mrs Abuaassi has also been without the medication she needs for 15 days. The couple's 14-year-old son said he was also worried about his relatives in Gaza who were all staying together in one house, but that he was happy to be back in the UK in emergency hotel accommodation. ""It's better than being in a flat with 50 people,"" he said. ""I mean it's nice having a bed to sleep on instead of sleeping on the mattress on the floor."" He and his two brothers and younger sister are sharing two hotel rooms with their parents as they wait to find out if they can be housed. He said he missed studying and wanted to return to education. ""As soon as we get settled, we can start to get into school and that was kind of the most important thing right now to get into school,"" he said. ""So yeah, we need to get a house.""

Israel Gaza: Hospitals caught on front line of warPublished14 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hospitals and medical facilities have become caught up in intense fighting as Israel presses its offensive against Hamas in Gaza City. The focus of attention has been on Al-Shifa, Gaza's largest hospital, where thousands are trapped by nearby battles, but other facilities are also reporting a lack of supplies and power because of fighting. Israel says it is not targeting hospitals directly but acknowledges ""clashes"" around Al-Shifa and other facilities. The World Health Organization (WHO) says 36 health facilities including 22 hospitals have been damaged since the war began on 7 October, and only a handful are now still operational. Here is what the BBC knows about the situation at the main facilities in northern Gaza. The WHO said on Sunday that Al-Shifa in Gaza City - the territory's largest with 700 beds - had ceased to function and that the situation inside was ""dire and perilous"". The surrounding streets are engulfed by fighting between Hamas and Israeli forces. Critical infrastructure has been damaged,according to the UN. Israel says Hamas fighters operate in tunnels underneath the hospital - a claim which Hamas denies. Staff inside say it is impossible to leave without risking injury or death. The WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on X that ""constant gunfire and bombings in the area"" had ""exacerbated the already critical circumstances"". Multiple reports from inside say there are no food and no fuel to run generators. Solar energy is being used to power a few critical systems. There have been communication blackouts - the Doctors Without Borders charity was unable to contact its members inside Gaza over the weekend. Attempts by the BBC to contact workers have often been unsuccessful. The Hamas-run health ministry has said there are at least 2,300 people still inside the hospital - up to 650 patients, 200-500 staff and around 1,500 people seeking shelter. This number includes newborn babies being kept in a surgical theatre at the site. Staff say that three of 39 infants in their care died over the weekend for lack of incubators. Surviving babies were at serious risk of death, according to doctors. The Israel Defense Force's (IDF) chief spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said on Saturday that Israel would provide assistance to evacuate the babies to a ""safer hospital"". However, that evacuation had yet to happen as of Monday afternoon. Hospital staff have told the BBC that moving the babies safely would require sophisticated equipment, and that there is no ""safer hospital"" inside Gaza. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said that the 300 litres offered would have been enough for the babies and more could be provided. ""Hamas did not want to accept solutions for the lack of fuel needed to save the babies,"" he said, adding: ""We provided fuel and they [Hamas] refused to take it."" On Saturday, Colonel Moshe Tetro of the IDF said there were clashes nearby, but no shooting at the hospital itself, and no siege. Anyone who wanted to leave, he said, could do so. He insisted that to say otherwise was a lie. Marwan Abu Saada, a surgeon in Shifa, told the BBC that there was bombing around the hospital and ambulances could not get in. The IDF also said efforts to deliver 300 litres of fuel to Shifa on Sunday had failed because Hamas had refused to accept it - something Hamas denied. Mr Abu Saada told the BBC on the same day that 300 litres would ""last 30 minutes"" - the hospital needs 10,000 litres a day to operate normally. On top of this is the growing risk of disease from lack of sanitation and the decomposition of dead bodies that cannot be refrigerated. Mr Abu Saada said that attempts to bury the dead had been thwarted by fighting around the complex, and the morgue refrigerator had failed for lack of power. There were 100 bodies unburied in the hospital courtyard, he added. Dr Marwan Al-Barsh, director general of Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, said that as well as the courtyard, the hospital's mortuaries were also filled with corpses. He added that hospital officials had tried to bury those who had died in the hospital, but that people had been unable to leave without coming under fire. Israel says it knows ""with certainty"" that there is a Hamas command centre underneath Shifa. It has shared a 3-D representation of what it said were a network of tunnels under the hospital, and recordings it says are of Hamas fighters discussing them. Hamas denies it is using the hospital or that it has an operations centre underneath. Doctors inside insist there is no Hamas presence there. The BBC's Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abualouf said that he had never seen ""any military capability"" inside the hospital, but acknowledged it was difficult to verify either Israel's or Hamas's claims. WHO's Dr Tedros said on 10 November that the hospitals that were functioning in the Gaza Strip were ""operating way beyond their capacities"". Dr Ghassan Abu Sittah, a doctor working at Al-Ahli in northern Gaza, told the BBC that the hospital was now taking all of the wounded from Gaza City but that it did not have the resources to cope. He said that ambulances were arriving with wounded people every 10 minutes, and that hospital staff did not have access to a blood bank, which he said was surrounded by Israeli tanks. ""We don't have an x-ray technician and we are short of medication to the point where we're having to do extremely painful procedures on large wounds to keep them clean with no analgesia, no anaesthetic,"" he said. He added that operating rooms were being saved for life-saving surgeries ""because we don't have enough resources to treat everybody"". Last month Al-Ahli wasthe scene of a deadly blastthat was at the centre of competing claims between Israel and Hamas about who was responsible. The Gaza Strip's second largest hospital after Al-Shifa has, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent, ceased to be operational. The Palestinian Red Crescent said on Saturday that its teams were trapped inside with 500 patients and around 14,000 displaced people, mostly women and children. On Sunday it stated that the hospital was ""out of service... no longer operational... due to the depletion of available fuel and power outage"". It added that the hospital ""has been left to fend for itself under ongoing Israeli bombardment, posing severe risks to the medical staff, patients and displaced civilians"". It also said that an ""evacuation convoy"" travelling from Khan Younis in southern Gaza towards Al-Quds hospital had had to turn back after experiencing ""relentless bombardment"". It added that those trapped in the hospital were without food, water or electricity. Doctors Without Borders said on Saturday it had lost contact with a surgeon working and sheltering in Al-Quds with his family. A spokesman for the Red Crescent told Reuters news agency that the hospital had been cut off for nearly a week, with ""no way in, no way out"", and the surrounding area was under constant attack. The small Rantisi Specialised Hospital for Children and the nearby Al-Nasr hospital, in the north of Gaza City, were evacuated on Friday save for a handful of patients and staff. Rantisi had Gaza's only paediatric cancer ward. The IDF released to the BBC details of phone conversations between an official at Rantisi and a senior officer in the IDF, in which they discussed arrangements to get ambulances to evacuate patients. The hospital official asked about hundreds of displaced civilians camped out at the two hospitals. The Israeli officer told them to leave via the main entrance at 11:20 and explained in detail which streets they should walk along to leave Gaza City. And he twice told the hospital official to make sure civilians were carrying something white to show they were not combatants. ""They will all go out with their hands in the air,"" the hospital official said. ""Perfect,"" the Israeli said. In a video verified by the BBC, peoplewaving white flagswere seen apparently coming under gunfire on as they attempted to leave Al-Nasr on Friday. It was not clear where the gunshots had come from or who had fired them. Dr Bakr Gaoud, the head of Rantisi, was quoted by the New York Times as saying that Israeli forces had arrived at the end of last week and provided maps showing a safe way out. ""We dragged our patients out of their beds,"" he said, adding that the patients in the worst condition were sent to Al-Shifa, which was already overwhelmed and ceasing to function. Everyone else, he said, had made their way to southern Gaza away from the main fighting. On Monday evening IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari showed journalists what he said was evidence of Hamas infrastructure at Rantisi - video of explosives, suicide vests and even a motorcycle used in the 7 October attacks, hidden in a basement. He showed video of a deep shaft with a ladder down the side which he said was the entrance to a tunnel that was next to both a school and the hospital, adding it was ""nothing else but a terror tunnel"". The UN's office for humanitarian affairs said in its Sunday night update that the Swedish clinic had been ""hit and destroyed"" by an air strike on Saturday. There were around 500 people sheltering there, it reported, and the casualty toll was ""unclear"". On Monday morning, BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf spoke to Maryam al-Arabeed, a 65-year-old woman who said Israeli soldiers had entered the facility on Sunday night and moved everyone out. She said she had then watched ""an Israeli bulldozer completely demolish the building"". ""They took the young men out including my three sons and separated the women and children,"" she told the BBC. She added that she did not know where her sons or relatives were. The IDF said it was investigating the report. ""In start contrast to Hamas's intentional attacks on Israeli men, women and children, the IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm,"" the Israeli military added.",2023-11-14T00:44:04.000Z

Al-Shifa: WHO says Gaza hospital unable to bury dead bodiesPublished13 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"This story contains some upsetting details Thousands could be trapped inside Gaza's largest hospital due to nearby fighting, while officials have warned of rotting bodies piling up there. Al-Shifa Hospital, which is also tackling power cuts and a lack of fuel, is ""nearly a cemetery"", the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. The hospital's manager said it was under a ""blockade"", and that dogs had started eating corpses. The area around the hospital has seen intense fighting in recent days. US President Joe Biden said he hoped to see ""less intrusive action"" at the hospital, which he said ""must be protected"". Gaza City has seen an intensification of fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces in recent days, much of which has been taking place in streets close to the hospital. There have been reports of tanks and armoured vehicles being within metres of the hospital gate. Israel accuses Hamas of operating a command-and-control centre in tunnels underneath the hospital, which Hamas and the hospital deny. It also accuses Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, of ""preventing humanitarian solutions"". Israel's army has also said that while there are clashes close to Al-Shifa, there is no shooting at the hospital itself nor a siege, and that anyone wanting to leave can do so. Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the WHO, said about 600 people remained in the hospital, with others sheltering in hallways. ""Around the hospital there are dead bodies which cannot be taken care of or not even be buried or taken away to any sort of morgue,"" he said. ""The hospital is not working at all any more as it should. It's nearly a cemetery."" The Hamas-run health ministry has said there are at least 2,300 people still inside the hospital - up to 650 patients, 200 to 500 staff and around 1,500 people seeking shelter. Doctors have also spoken of bodies piling up and rotting at the hospital, and Dr Mohamed Abu Selmia, Al-Shifa's manager, said there were about 150 bodies decomposing, ""leaving unpleasant odours"". He told the BBC the Israeli authorities had still not granted permission for those bodies to leave the hospital to be buried, and that dogs had now entered the hospital grounds and started eating the bodies. There are also concerns about the fate of dozens of premature babies that are no longer able to stay in their incubators due to the power cuts. Dr Selmia said three babies were among several patients who have died due to a lack of oxygen. He said negotiations had been conducted with Israeli authorities to try to evacuate the babies, but that no agreement had been reached. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was offering ""practical solutions"" to evacuate the babies, but accused Hamas of not accepting proposals. ""They don't take the fuel that was offered for their generators. They don't support the movement of babies out in ambulances, so of course they're stuck there because [Hamas] want those terrible photographs,"" he said. He also accused Hamas of turning the hospital ""into a war zone"" by building tunnels underneath it. Hamas denies using the hospital for its operations, while doctors inside insist there is no Hamas presence there. As well as Al-Shifa, other hospitals across the Gaza Striphave reported widespread issues, including a lack of supplies and power due to the fighting and the blockade Israel has enforced on the territory since Hamas launched its attacks on Israel on 7 October.",2023-11-13T22:02:26.000Z

British-Palestinians ask PM for urgent meeting over GazaPublished13 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A British-Palestinian group has written to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, asking for an ""urgent meeting"" about Gaza. The letter also urges the UK government to ""use its influence"" to call for a ceasefire. It was sent, earlier on Monday, by the UK-based International Centre of Justice for Palestinians. The ICJP said it was speaking ""on behalf of members of the Palestinian community in the UK with families and loved ones living in Gaza"". The group said it wanted a meeting ""to express our concerns, similar to the meetings you have had with other British communities who have families in the region who have experienced distress similar to ours"". Calls for humanitarian pauses were ""inadequate"", it said. And the government's failure to call for a ceasefire ""is putting our loved ones in danger and is contributing to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis"". ""It also ignores our voices as British citizens with friends and family under attack in Gaza,"" the ICJP said. A spokesperson for the UK government told the BBC that it had ""helped more than 150 British nationals and dependents to leave Gaza so far"". ""We must see humanitarian pauses that allow enough time for hostages to be released, as well as aid to go in,"" it said. It said the Foreign Office was in regular contact with those who remained in Gaza, ""and our teams are working around the clock with the Israeli and Egyptian authorities to ensure they can leave as quickly as possible"". Six British-Palestinians told a press conference dozens of their family members had been killed in Gaza. Lubaba Khalid, who stepped down from chairing the Young BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) Labour network last month, over comments made by Labour leader Keir Starmer, said she had found out on social media her relatives had been killed. ""Due to the lack of electricity and networks, we have found it very difficult keep in touch with family members just to check if they're alive,"" she said. ""As a result, I found out my great uncle's house was bombed, on the social-media platform X [formerly known as Twitter] before I could get any confirmation from my own family."" Six members of her family had been killed in that bombing, she said, five of them children. Accountant Omar Mofeed accused the UK government of ""double standards"" in its treatment of those evacuating Gaza. Non-British family members of British nationals who have fled Gaza and are now in Cairo currently need to apply for British family visas from Egypt. And Mr Mofeed pointed to the visa schemes available to those fleeing war in Ukraine, including the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme - also known as Homes for Ukraine - and the Ukraine Family Scheme, both of which are free for those applying. The Foreign Office has previously told BBC News it is working with the Home Office to process visas for non-British family members of British nationals who have left Gaza.",2023-11-13T19:49:49.000Z

Brother of Hamas victim fears antisemitism in UKPublished13 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The brother of a British-Israeli man murdered by Hamas has told the BBC he has never been more fearful of antisemitism in the UK. Bernard Cowan, from Scotland, was killed by Hamas gunmen in his home on a kibbutz in Southern Israel during the 7 October attack. The 57-year-old left his family in Glasgow when he was just 19 to move to Israel. His brother Colin says he ""is filled with dread"" as a Jew living in Britain. He told BBC News how his brother loved the kibbutz way of life, working and living communally among the mango and banana trees. Bernard helped tend the gardens and lived happily with his wife, three children and two grandchildren, with one born just a few months ago. But Hamas gunmen ended the life he had built when they killed him on Kibbutz Sufa on 7 October, along with more than 1,200 other people. In his home in Glasgow, his brother Colin Cowan remembers a man who loved diving, travelling, whisky and his family. ""Bernard loved to live,"" he said. ""He was a free spirit and all he wanted to do was see the world. He was loved throughout the world. ""I think if you were to look at Bernard as a soul who wanted to do nothing but good for the world, and for his country, and to love his family, that would be the perfect epitaph."" Bernard was at his home with his wife on Kibbutz Sufa when Hamas gunmen arrived, armed with machine guns and missile launchers. They shot the tyres of an ambulance, killed a dog, then moved onto those living on the kibbutz who were hiding in their safe rooms. ""Bernard was claustrophobic,"" said Mr Cowan. ""There are no windows in the safe room for obvious reasons. He went out into his kitchen and two terrorists walked by and saw him there and shot him dead. Our world just fell apart."" Bernard's wife had to stay in the safe room for many more hours knowing her husband was lying dead just outside the room. Despite living so far away, Bernard remained close with his family in Scotland and visited regularly. Mr Cowan said: ""We break down thinking: 'Why is he not here?' It was recently my birthday and I always got a message from him saying 'happy 21st.' ""That was Bernard, he was always joking. And it never came this year. So yes, it's been a tough time."" But Colin doesn't just mourn his brother - the grief is mixed with deep anxiety for the safety of his own community in the UK. ""Hamas want us off the face of the earth,"" said Mr Cowan. ""How can we live in this society today knowing that there are terrorist organisations out there who only want to murder and eradicate Jews from the world?"" While many British Jews feel enormous concern and pain about the situation their relatives and friends in Israel are facing, Mr Cowan says that in Israel they worry about their relatives in the UK. ""My nephew, my brother's son, asked me if I would come and live in Israel because of the antisemitism in the UK,"" he said. ""As Jews we are worried. I'm not a fearful person but it does fill me with dread where we are at the moment and where we could end up. Britain was meant to be safe but maybe it's not."" He added: ""When I walk down the street I'm thinking: 'What would they do if they knew I was Jewish?' And that's a horrendous thought. I ask, are we any different to where Jews were in Germany in 1938?"" Some pro-Palestinian protests, where a minority have carried antisemitic banners and chanted slogans perceived as antisemitic, have left many Jews scared. ""People have a right to protest as we have freedom of speech in the UK,"" he said. ""The problem with the protest is there's that element which isn't just about the humanitarian side. ""There's an element within these protests, which is about Hamas and supporting that organisation and that's where the fear comes."" It is why Mr Cowan says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,"" referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. The chant has drawn criticism from some, including ex- Home Secretary Suella Braverman who said it was an ""expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world"". Israel and most Jewish groups agree. The interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself. Mr Cowan said: ""There is only one meaning to that and that means to eradicate all Jews from the earth."" He also highlighted the ripping down of posters showing the faces of the 239 hostages, including dozens of children, held by Hamas. ""If we're putting up pictures of hostages and then they're getting ripped down, then no wonder we are in fear for our lives,"" he said. ""Because if they're willing to do that then they're willing to support Hamas, because they're not willing to accept that the hostages have to be released."" The Cowan family has received support from Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf,whose in-laws were recently trapped in Gaza. Last month, after the attack in Israel, the first minister attended a solidarity event at a synagogue in Glasgow and hugged Bernard Cowan's mother as she mourned outliving her son. ""You could feel his empathy... but a lot of people don't believe what he believes,"" added Mr Cowan. Asked if he remembers feeling this fearful in the UK as a Jew, he said: ""Never, never in my whole life. There's not a Jewish person who I've spoken to who's not fearful of the situation we're in at the moment.""",2023-11-13T18:00:09.000Z

US airstrikes target more Iran-backed bases in SyriaPublished13 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The US has conducted ""precision"" air strikes in Syria on facilities used by the Iranian revolutionary guard, the Pentagon has said. Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin said the strikes were in response to ""continued attacks"" on US bases in Iraq and Syria by Iran-backed fighters. At least eight pro-Iran fighters were killed, a UK-based war monitor said. It is the third time since 26 October that the US has carried out such air strikes. They come amid rising tensions in the region due to the Israel-Hamas war. Mr Austin confirmed the air strikes in a brief statement on Sunday, saying they were conducted against a training facility and a safe house near the cities of Albu Kamal and Mayadin in eastern Syria. He added the attacks were ordered by President Joe Biden ""to make clear that the United States will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests"". The Pentagon did not provide any details on the damage caused by the strikes, but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, said eight members of Iran-backed militias were killed in the attack. Seven others were injured, SOHR said. Most of the victims were non-Syrian nationals. The group added that the strikes destroyed a weapons depot around Abu Kamal, near the Iraq-Syria border, and a rocket launch platform near Mayadin. Iran-backed militias had also fired rockets at US bases overnight, SOHR said, though no one was killed. The monitor has since reported a total of six attacks on International Coalition bases in Syria since Monday morning. Pentagon officials said last week that Iranian-backed militias have attacked US bases and facilities in Iraq and Syria at least 41 times since the Israel-Hamas war began on 7 October. They added that 56 US personnel have been injured in these attacks between 17 October and early November. The injuries are a combination of traumatic brain injury and minor injuries. All personnel have since been treated and have returned to work, the Pentagon said. American officials attribute the attacks to Iranian proxy groups operating in the region. Iran is believed to have deployed hundreds of troops in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad in the country's 12-year civil war. It has also armed, trained and financed thousands of Shia Muslim militiamen - mostly from Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, but also Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen - who have also fought alongside the Syrian army. On 27 October, the US carried out its first of the air strikes against two weapons and ammunition storage facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran-backed militias. Another ""self-defence strike"" was conducted on 8 November on a facility in eastern Syria by two F-15 aircraft, the Pentagon has said. With a war raging in the Gaza Strip and fears of an escalation into a regional conflict, there is an underlying worry that Iran and its proxies could soon get involved in the fight between Israel and Hamas, sparking a wider and even more serious war. The US has emphasised that its recent airstrikes are not connected to what is going on in Gaza, that they were not done in any coordination with Israel, and that they are completely separate actions of self-defence. American officials said they have been in contact with Iran and its proxies to warn against the escalation of fighting in the region. ""We aim to clarify that our military actions do not signal a change in our approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict, and we have no intentions of escalating conflict in the region,"" a senior Pentagon official has said in a statement. Last month, President Biden sent a rare message directly to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warning him not to target US troops in the Middle East.",2023-11-13T17:16:56.000Z

UK doctor Ahmed Sabra finally gets to Egypt from GazaPublished13 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A UK doctor who was stuck in war-torn Gaza when his name was left off a list of British nationals has finally reached Egypt. Ahmed Sabra, a UK citizen who holds a British passport, was visiting family in Gaza with his wife and three children at the start of the war. His wife and children were allowed to cross into Egypt on Thursday, butDr Sabra was turned away. The Foreign Office said it was working to get all British nationals home. Dr Sabra, a consultant cardiologist at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire who was a cardiology registrar at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, said he had made it through the Rafah crossing on Monday and was waiting to get his passport stamped. Former colleague and friend Sara Gretton, who worked with him in Swansea, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastthat he had messaged her overnight to say his name was now on the list of British nationals eligible for evacuation and he was heading to the border. Thousands of foreign nationals have been making the same trip to the only open crossing out of Gaza, but only those named on a list, published daily by the Gaza Border Authority, are allowed to cross. Those on the list must be cleared by both Egyptian and Israeli authorities. Ms Gretton and Dr Sabra's supporters asked why he was not on the list last week. ""It seems so simple you know - the Foreign Office informs the agencies that he is a British national, his name should be added to the list, it should be published and he should be evacuated."" ""I just don't know what has gone wrong since last Thursday, and that hasn't been done."" Hamas's attacks on Israel on 7 October sparked the war. Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 240 others hostage in its unprecedented cross-border assault it launched that day. After a month of Israeli bombardment and nearly two weeks after Israel launched a major ground offensive into the territory, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Friday that 11,078 people had been killed, while 1.5 million had fled their homes. Dr Sabra's former colleagues at Morriston Hospital held a rally on Monday in support of his safe return home.

Israeli reservist: I chose to fight but don't know if I'll come back alivePublished13 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Yakir doesn't know when he'll be able to speak to his boyfriend again once his Israeli army unit goes into the Gaza Strip to fight Hamas. ""I haven't told my family I am going inside Gaza. I don't want them to be worried. Only my boyfriend knows I'll be inside."" ""I don't know what kind of mission I'm going to get, or if I will even come back alive."" The 33-year-old was speaking to me hours before the mission was due to start, and he said he had permission from his superiors to speak to the BBC. In his interview, he said he felt Israel was given no option after the attacks of 7 October but to go into Gaza to destroy Hamas. ""If they didn't fear to enter Israel, we mustn't fear to go into Gaza, to make sure they will never do again what they did a month ago to innocent people, babies and children."" Yakir was called up along with hundreds and thousands of reservists, immediately after the attack in which 1,200 people were killed and some 240 taken hostage. On the day of the attack, he and his boyfriend were asleep in their apartment when they were suddenly woken by red alerts on the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Home Front Command app, which warns of incoming rocket attacks. ""I live in Ramat Gan, next to Tel Aviv. We're used to alarms. I just went back to sleep,"" he recalls. ""But a little while later, my boyfriend shook me to tell me that terrorists had entered Kibbutz Be'eri and kidnapped 20 people… It was only a little part of what was happening."" Yakir says he soon realised that he was going to be called up by the IDF. ""I understood how big it was. You knew it before the government said it. I got my bag ready, and said, 'Oh My God, I am now saying goodbye to my normal life.'"" Yakir didn't want to be a soldier, he tells me. He didn't enjoy the army because he didn't like being ordered to do things. Military service is compulsory in Israel and like all conscripted men, he served three years until the age of 21. He remains eligible for reserve duty until he is 40. Before 7 October, he wanted to go to the doctor to ask them to say that he was not fit to be a reservist on medical grounds. Immediately after the Hamas attack, Israel launched its offensive with the declared aim of destroying the group. The war has so far killed more than 11,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,500 children. I ask him what he thought of the civilian casualties. Yakir avoids answering my question directly, except to say that the IDF gives prior warning to evacuate civilians before striking. But in a war, he says, civilian deaths are unavoidable. ""You have to remember, we didn't start this war."" Instead of waiting to be called up, he put himself forward for active duty and tells me that he is fighting to live in a world in which Hamas - which Israel, the UK and other countries consider a terrorist organisation - no longer exists. ""But it was not easy, to leave what seemed like a perfect life for me, until that morning of 7 October."" While he was waiting to be deployed, he wanted to make the most of his ""normal life"" with his boyfriend. They went to the familiar places that they enjoyed visiting before 7 October. ""There's a lake in Ramat Gan national park. I went there with my boyfriend and some other friends. I just wanted to look at the dusk. I felt that it was the last time I was having a normal life before I was going to the army. I was sitting there, looking at the water, and quietly saying goodbye."" Yakir was first deployed in the southern town of Sderot. He spent two weeks patrolling the city's streets. There were reports of Hamas gunmen still at large, and he saw some gunmen being captured. ""I didn't sleep a lot. Fear was waking me up. I was missing my family. I was tired, hungry."" We spoke as Yakir was preparing to enter Gaza, on foot and after nightfall. He didn't know how long his deployment would be. ""Inside Gaza, we won't have any cell phones. The enemy can track them and strike with missiles,"" he said. During a recent operation on the Gaza border, Yakir says, the whole unit had only one phone between them - a secure military phone - which he was sometimes able to use to send a short message to his boyfriend to say he was ok. His boyfriend then passed those messages on to his family. But this time he thinks it might not be so easy to stay in touch. Yakir just wants to believe that the war will be over quickly, or else that he will be replaced by another soldier, so that he can go back home. The lives of all Israelis have changed forever, Yakir tells me, and he is driven by a sense of unity that he tells me everyone in Israel feels at the moment. ""Feeling unsafe is our national trauma now."" Before the war, the country was deeply divided over the government's controversial judicial overhaul plans, which led to months of protests. ""What happened shocked the country so much that we decided we didn't want to fight with each other anymore,"" Yakir says. ""The 7th of October reunited us. Orthodox and non-Orthodox, right wing and left wing, we're one nation today."" As we end our call, Yakir tells me that he is very afraid. ""I know terrorists can pop up from tunnels, shoot at us and go back into the tunnels."" ""Already one officer of my unit has been killed. They can shoot rockets at us, and there are no alerts in Gaza.""",2023-11-13T15:19:58.000Z

Israel's president denies it is striking Gaza's Al-Shifa hospitalPublished13 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli President Isaac Herzog has denied that Israel is striking the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip. The UN has said the situation at Al-Shifa Hospital is dire, with constant gunfire and bombings in the area. Doctors there have said newborn babies have died after power for incubators was cut off due to a lack of fuel. When challenged by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg about those reports, Mr Herzog rejected them as ""spin by Hamas"" and insisted there was electricity. The president also showed what he said was a copy of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf was found on the body of a Hamas fighter in Gaza. He said a copy translated into Arabic was found ""just a few days ago"" in a children's room that had been ""turned into a military operation base of Hamas"". The Nazi leader's antisemitic manifesto was first printed in 1925. Finding a copy of it in northern Gaza, Mr Herzog said, showed that some in Hamas ""learned again and again Adolf Hitler's ideology of hating the Jews"". On Sunday morning, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it had lost communication with its contacts at Al-Shifa, with staff and patients trapped by fighting outside. It warned that the hospital had been reportedly attacked multiple times over the previous two days, leaving several people dead and many others wounded. The intensive care unit had suffered damage, as had areas where displaced people were sheltering, it added. It also said there were reports that some people who fled the hospital were shot at. WHO chief Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus later said that contact has been restored but warned of ""dire"" conditions inside. He repeated calls for a ceasefire and said the hospital has been without electricity and water for three days. Doctors and the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza have said a lack of fuel for Al-Shifa's generators there means patients cannot be operated on and incubators for premature babies cannot run. But the president disputed this. ""We deny this at all, there is a lot of spin by Hamas... but there's electricity in Shifa, everything is operating,"" Mr Herzog told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. Israel has said that Hamas has a base underneath the hospital building - a claim denied by Hamas. Asked whether Israel has gone too far in its response to Hamas's 7 October attack, in which 1,200 people in Israel were killed and some 240 taken hostage back to Gaza, Mr Herzog said: ""We work exactly according to the rules of international humanitarian law. We alert each and every civilian, because their homes have become terror bases"". He added: ""Unfortunately, there are tragedies. We don't shy away from them. But truly many of the tragedies are done by Hamas, like they bombed [Al-]Shifa hospital yesterday, not Israel."" Surgeon Marwan Abu Saada told the BBC on Saturday that the hospital had run out of water, food and electricity. He said the sounds of shooting and bombardments echoed through the hospital ""every second"". Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel would help evacuate babies from Al-Shifa following a request from the hospital administration. Dr Abu Saada said on Sunday night that three newborn babies had already died. The Israeli military also released a video of soldiers leaving 15 jerry cans of fuel on the side of a street for the hospital on Sunday but claimed Hamas stopped them being picked up. However, doctors said the amount would not bring enough power for an hour, while any evacuation of the babies needed specialised mobile incubators. Asked whether it was time to listen to calls from Israel's allies,including from France's President Macron, for a ceasefire and measures to reduce civilian casualties, Mr Herzog asserted Israel's right to defend itself after the October attacks. ""We of course listen to our allies, but first and foremost, we defend ourselves,"" he said. He acknowledged that there had been civilian deaths in Gaza but blamed Hamas for many of the tragedies. Mr Herzog said his country's operations in Gaza were carried out ""according to the rules of international humanitarian law"", with Israel alerting civilians with phone calls and text messages, and urging them to evacuate from northern Gaza and ""go down [to southern Gaza]"". ""We give them humanitarian pauses so that they can go down [south],"" Mr Herzog said. He accused Hamas of stopping civilians from fleeing northern Gaza when asked about the pictures from Gaza showing many still sheltering in the area and reports that they were unable to leave. More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. More than 1.5m people are also displaced, according to the United Nations' agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa). Fighting has been fierce in the northern part of the 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide enclave, but blasts have also hitthe southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis.",2023-11-13T12:39:08.000Z

Toddler among US hostages in Gaza - White HousePublished13 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The White House says that a three-year-old American whose parents were killed by Hamas is among the hostages in Gaza. President Joe Biden raised the issue of hostages, including the toddler, with a call with Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar on Sunday. It comes as the White House says ""urgent"" efforts to free hostages taken after the 7 October attack by Hamas are continuing. The US says there are 10 Americans still unaccounted for since the attack. According to a readout of the call between Mr Biden and Sheikh Tamim released by the White House, the president ""condemned unequivocally the holding of hostages by Hamas, including many young children, one of whom is a three-year old American citizen toddler"". Both leaders said ""all hostages must be released without further delay"". Qatar was instrumental in efforts to release two US hostages who were abducted by Hamas's deadly raid on Israel last month and has been central to continuing efforts. Mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan, of Chicago, were released in late October, two of four hostages who have been freed. A fifth was rescued by Israeli forces. Israel Defense Forces have previously said the hostages include 20 children and between 10 and 20 people over the age of 60. On Sunday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS politics programme Face the Nation that active negotiations to release hostages were ""under way between Israel and Qatar, who is communicating with Hamas, and the United States is involved in those discussions, very much involved in those discussions"". ""We are actively working to ensure the safe return of every American being held hostage and every other person being held hostage by Hamas,"" he said. President Biden's top Mideast adviser Brett McGurk is travelling to Israel and other countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, this week to work on the release of US hostages. Mr Sullivan told ABC News that nine US citizens and one permanent resident are currently missing. He is expected to meet the family members of the American hostages this week. CBS reported on Sunday that two US officials told the network that one of the main sticking points in the current negotiations is the fact that Hamas has yet to present a list of names of those it is holding or would be able to free. Other groups in the region, including Islamic Jihad, also have captives. Israel began striking Gaza after the Hamas attacks a month ago, which saw 1,200 people killed and more than 240 taken hostage. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza since - of whom more than 4,500 were children. Mr Biden and Sheikh Tamim also discussed the need to protect civilians and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the territory.",2023-11-13T10:40:24.000Z

More powers for policing protests considered by governmentPublished13 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The government is looking to strengthen police powers to deal with protesters, following demonstrations in London. Right-wing protesters clashed with officers on Saturday and some members of the huge pro-Palestinian march were accused of using antisemitic slogans. Suella Braverman is under continued pressure after criticising the police ahead of the Armistice Day march. Ministers are thought to be considering changes, such as lowering the threshold for when police could apply for a ban. And more conditions could also be imposed on demonstrators for public safety. TheSun has reported these could include stopping people climbing on statues,bus stops and scaffolding during protests, tightening the laws around smoke bombs and flares and against glorifying terrorists. The new measures are reportedly being ""seriously"" examined by the government. Any change would require new laws but could be included in criminal justice legislation already making its way through the Commons. It is likely to result in more intense political debate as it worked its way through Parliament. Downing Street hit pause on deciding Mrs Braverman's political future on Thursday while it focussed on the weekend's events but with Remembrance commemorations passed and a clearer picture of what happened on Saturday, pressure will resume on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to send a clear message on his home secretary. Some opposition MPs have called for her to be sacked, and a number of ministers have distanced themselves from her comments. Mrs Braverman wrote an article in the Times last week criticising the police, which was published without the changes No 10 had asked for. She has since faced accusations that the piece - which claimed the police ""largely ignore... pro-Palestinian mobs"" - had emboldened the counter-protesters. Labour say she she stoked tensions on Saturday by accusing the police of bias. On Sunday, Mrs Braverman broke a silence of almost 48 hours to thank police officers who were faced with violence and aggression from ""protesters and counter-protesters"". But she stood firm on her position on the pro-Palestinian marches saying that ""week by week, the streets of London were being polluted by hate, violence and antisemitism"". Mr Sunak said those involved in crimes at the demonstrations on Saturday must face the full force of the law, with the ""despicable actions of a minority of people"" undermining ""those who have chosen to express their views peacefully"". The Metropolitan Police said 145 people were arrested - the ""vast majority"" of whom were counter-protesters near the Cenotaph war memorial - and nine officers were injured. The force condemned violence from the counter-protesters, who it says set out to confront the pro-Palestinian march. Seven men have been charged over disorder for offences including inciting racial hatred. The pro-Palestinian demonstration saw an estimated 300,000 people march through central London calling for a Gaza ceasefire. It was the biggest UK rally since the war between Israel and Hamas began on 7 October. Police added while the march itself did not see such physical violence, other serious offences were being investigated, including antisemitic hate crimes. A reshuffle of Mr Sunak's top team has been rumoured to be on the cards for months. The downside for the prime minister of sacking Mrs Braverman would be that it would anger her supporters, who are predominantly on the right of the party. One Tory MP said efforts were already under way to lobby to keep her in the job. Mrs Braverman has also never hidden her ambitions to one day be the party leader and sacked ministers have been known to be a thorn in the side of their former bosses. On the other hand, Mr Sunak could decide keeping her on outweighs the controversies and he could choose to back her. In order to avoid claims of weakness though, he'd have to find a convincing reason for why she went ahead and published a newspaper opinion piece that hadn't been cleared by Downing Street. He would also frustrate those Tory MPs who have tired of her knack for attracting controversy and are starting to use phrases like ""unhelpful"" and ""brand damage"" about her.

Gaza: Surgeon ready to help says moral duty trumps fearPublished13 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"With each passing day, groups of volunteer medics in different parts of the world remain on standby to go to Gaza to care for the thousands of injured and sick people who fill hospitals stretched to the extreme. Professor Nick Maynard is one of them. Nick is a consultant surgeon, based in Oxford, who's been travelling to the Gaza Strip and West Bank for more than a decade. Since 2010 he has been to Gaza almost every year, usually leading a group of medics who teach students and junior doctors. In May, he witnessed the conflict first-hand whenat least 15 Palestinians, including three commanders of the militant group Islamic Jihad, were killedin Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip. Gaza locked down, and after four days of ""non-stop"" bombing Nick was evacuated by the UN. He is now on standby to go and work in operating theatres with the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, as soon as it becomes safe to do so amidthe conflict between Israel and Hamas. ""A huge sense of duty"" is motivating him to want to go and do what he can, and he says he is not alone. ""I think there is fear, apprehension, not knowing what one would find, but I think the other motives for doing so… are so powerful that they outweigh everything else,"" he says. ""I consider it a huge privilege to be in a position to help these people who need help more than most of us can possibly understand. ""It just feels the right thing to do...I've got many friends over there who I'm very close to. I've got Gazan friends staying with us [now]."" He shares the story of Enas, a young Gazan doctor he trained who he and his wife have become an ""adoptive parent"" to. She left Gaza eight years ago after securing a scholarship to study in England but has never been able to return. As part of Israel's blockade of Gaza, Palestinians are prohibited from entering and leaving except in extremely rare cases, including if people need care for life-threatening conditions or if they are on a limited list of merchants. When Enas got married, Nick walked her down the aisle because her family were denied permission to leave Gaza. She has had little contact with them in recent weeks due tocommunications blackouts, and goes days without knowing if they are alive or dead. ""They think they'll die,"" Nick says. ""They've all written their names in indelible ink on their arms and their legs so that if they get killed, they'll be identified."" The Islamic University of Gaza and Al-Azhar University, where Nick teaches, both sustained ""serious damage"" in October during bombing, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, which forms part of the Palestinian Authority. The Israel Defense Forces claimed the Islamic University of Gaza ""serves as a central training centre for Hamas engineers"" and a ""training institution for the development and production of weapons"", claims Nick is sceptical of. ""I've visited these buildings on many, many occasions and, more importantly, people I've known for many years and trust implicitly have spent decades in these buildings and [they] do not believe that happens,"" he says. ""It's inconceivable to me that they could be used as Hamas headquarters without the knowledge of people who work there day in, day out."" Countries including Turkey, Jordan, and Egypt have been calling for a ceasefire, as well as theUnited Nations and the leaders of all of its major agencies. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there would be no ceasefire without the release of Israeli hostages, but that humanitarian pauses might be possible to let aid into the enclave and hostages out. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also resisted callsfor one, saying it would allow Hamas to ""regroup and repeat"" its 7 October attacks, in which it killed 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped more than 200 others. Nick insists that in order for Gazan patients to be helped there needs to be a complete ceasefire, ""not a temporary pause of 48 hours"", as well as the creation of multiple corridors of aid - including from Israel. ""There's no way it can all come in through Rafah,"" he says, referring to the only crossing point for humanitarian aid on Gaza's southern border with Egypt. ""The main road up and down Gaza has been destroyed... so to transport patients from the north down to Rafah will, I think, be well nigh impossible. ""And many of those patients - if there is still power in the hospitals, which is disappearing - may be on ventilators."" More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,500 children - but Nick believes those numbers could be just the tip of the iceberg. ""As a result of the bombings there will be large numbers of deaths due to untreated cancers, untreated diabetes,"" he says. ""Until insulin was invented, diabetes killed everyone. Now, if they haven't got any insulin... diabetes will start killing people. ""If they've got no power, they can't give dialysis, so all patients in kidney failure will die, so that the amount of excess deaths will be huge in the next few months absolutely is a really important point."" The World Health Organization has said a ""public health catastrophe"" was imminent in Gaza, due to mass displacement, overcrowding, and damage to water and sanitation infrastructure. These conditions are perfect for the rapid spread of infectious diseases like cholera, Nick adds. ""They're drinking dirty, non-sterile water at the moment. The big danger is that infectious diseases just take control and run through the population...and that will lead to many, many thousands of deaths.""",2023-11-13T07:11:27.000Z

Those charged hailed from areas across the UK, including London, Norfolk, Flintshire, Kent, Manchester and West Lothian. Officers made dozens of arrests during Saturday's operation to prevent a breach of the peace, including a significant number of counter-protesters arrested in Tachbrook Street, Pimlico, as they tried to confront the main pro-Palestinian demonstrators. They have since been released. Those who were arrested for other matters in addition to a breach of the peace are being dealt with for those offences, police said. The force has said investigations are continuing into a number of other incidents. On Saturday, Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said the march had taken place against a backdrop of conflict in the Middle East, remembrance events and a ""week of intense debate"" about protest and policing, which ""all combined to increase community tensions"". He said the violence directed towards officers on Saturday was ""extraordinary and deeply concerning"", with nine injured after counter-protesters clashed with police along Whitehall and in Chinatown.

French march against antisemitism shakes up far right and far leftPublished12 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Something unprecedented is happening this weekend in Paris, brought about by the war between Israel and Hamas and its spill-over in Europe. For the first time ever, a major demonstration being attended by representatives of the major political parties includes the far right - but not the far left. On Sunday afternoon thousands of people heeded a call from the Speakers of the two houses of parliament to show their support for French ""Republican"" values and their rejection of antisemitism - this in the face of a steep rise in antisemitic actions since 7 October. Among the first to announce their presence were Marine Le Pen, three-time presidential candidate for the National Rally (formerly the National Front), and the party's young president, Jordan Bardella. Almost simultaneously came a rejoinder from their counterpart on the far left, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, irascible leader of France Unbowed (LFI). His party would not be attending, he tweeted, because the march was a ""rendezvous for unconditional supporters of the massacre [of Gazans]"". It is hard to overestimate the symbolic significance of this switch-over. For decades French politics erected a bulwark against the far right, whose views - not least on Jews - were deemed ""anti-Republican"". The old National Front under Marine's father Jean-Marie Le Pen was seen as beyond the pale, and it was shunned. The far left meanwhile - the Communists, the Trotskyists and the new formations like Mr Mélenchon's LFI - were certainly attacked for their views, but they were never excluded. They were part of the broad political family, in a way that the Le Pen franchise clearly wasn't. A few years ago, for a far-left party not to have been part of a march against antisemitism would have been unthinkable. For a far-right party to have been there instead would have been unconscionable. Such is the shake-up in the political order, which of course long predates the Gaza war and is mirrored in varying ways across other European countries. Today's far right, rebranded ""hard right"" or ""national right"" has - in France at least - forgotten its obsession with Jews and its claims of a ""Jewish lobby"". Its primary focus now is the three I's - immigration, insecurity and Islamism - issues on which it finds common cause with many Jews. Meanwhile the far left in France, analysing Gaza through the anti-colonial lens, sees an oppressed people hammered by a superpower proxy and shouts ""Solidarity!""  Having lost the support of the old working class, many of whom vote National Rally, it has a new natural base among politicised immigrants. Thus we arrive at the novel situation where a party whose founder once called the Holocaust a ""detail of history"" openly embraces the cause of French Jews; and at the other end of the spectrum, a party built on ideas of human rights and equality stands accused of antisemitism for failing to call Hamas ""terrorist"". Maybe this should all be nuanced. After all, many people still think that at heart the far right, by virtue of its French-first ethos, cannot help but be anti-Jewish.  They note that Jordan Bardella this week refused to explicitly call Jean-Marie Le Pen antisemitic - a faux-pas to which enemies of the National Rally (RN) have reacted with glee. And on the far left there are signs of division around Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose prickly personality and autocratic methods are driving some colleagues to exasperation.  This week one senior lieutenant, Raquel Garrido, was given a four-month suspension as party spokeswoman for challenging the leader's line - not least on Hamas. But the fundamental point remains: the RN under Marine Le Pen is manoeuvring itself very successfully into the mainstream, while Mr Mélenchon's LFI is manoeuvring itself out. Opinion polls bear it out: according to IFOP last week, Marine Le Pen would trounce the opposition in the first round of a presidential election today, with up to 33% of the vote. Mr Mélenchon, at 22% in the 2022 election, is down to 14%. This week one of the historic figures in the fight against antisemitism in France gave his views on these ironies of history and politics. Serge Klarsfeld and his wife Beate helped bring Nazi war criminals to justice, and documented the deportations and deaths of 80,000 Jews from France exterminated in the Holocaust. Speaking to Le Figaro newspaper, Mr Klarsfeld, now 88, said: ""For me the DNA of the far right is antisemitism. So when I see a big party of the far right abandon antisemitism and negationism and move towards our Republican values, naturally I rejoice."" ""The far left for its part has always had its own antisemitic tradition. So just as I am relieved to see the RN… take a stand for Jews, so I am sad to see the far left abandon its actions to combat antisemitism.""",2023-11-12T14:43:49.000Z

Gaza hospital crippled as fighting rages nearbyPublished12 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Staff inside Gaza's largest hospital have said patients and refugees are trapped in horrific conditions as heavy fighting rages in nearby streets. A surgeon at Al-Shifa in Gaza City told the BBC that the hospital had run out of water, food and electricity. Israel said it had clashed with Hamas nearby but not fired on the hospital. It said it would help to evacuate babies to ""a safer hospital"" on Sunday, after medics said two had died and 37 others were at risk. The BBC has been sent pictures of at least 20 newborn babies being kept in a surgical theatre at Al-Shifa, as doctors warn they may die because the neonatal intensive care unit has stopped working, due to the lack of electricity. Reports from inside the hospital paint a picture of horror and confusion, with regular fighting nearby, patients who have recently undergone operations unable to evacuate, and bodies piling up without any way to bury them. Thousands of people are thought to have sought refuge in Al-Shifa, which has been at the centre of fierce fighting for two days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repeatedly accuse Hamas of operating from tunnels underneath the hospital, which Hamas denies. Surgeon Marwan Abu Saada told the BBC that the sounds of shooting and bombardments echoed through Al-Shifa ""every second"". He said attempts to bury the dead had been thwarted by fighting around the complex. ""We don't want to have any outbreaks due to these dead bodies,"" he said, adding that the morgue refrigerator was not working because the generator had run out of fuel. Physicians for Human Rights Israel, a doctors group, said two premature babies had died because there was no electricity. The group warnedthat there was ""a real risk to the lives of 37 other premature infants"". Israel said there was no siege of Al-Shifa, and that the east side of the hospital was open for the safe passage of those who wanted to leave. Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israel would help those ""in the paediatric department to get to a safer hospital"" on Sunday. He said the decision was taken following a request from the hospital administration and Israel ""will provide the assistance needed"". Earlier, Colonel Moshe Tetro said there were clashes near Al-Shifa between Hamas and Israeli forces, but no shooting at the hospital itself. Pictures shared with the BBC show at least 20 infants in a surgical ward, wrapped in blankets and lined up in rows on adult hospital beds. Many of them appear to have tape on their faces, suggesting the need for oxygen administration. Doctors have warned for at least a fortnight that the number of available incubators was being reduced due to the power shortage amid the ongoing Israeli siege. Dr Abu Saada said the babies needed intensive care, life support equipment and artificial respiration. ""I'm afraid if we leave these children in this unit in this condition we are allowing them to die… they are premature babies"", he said, in a voice note passed on to the BBC. International charities have warned that patients in hospitals close to fighting in Gaza are at risk of dying because of a lack of medical treatment. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) deputy medical coordinator told the BBC that if there was no ceasefire, ""all the patients who are remaining in these hospitals will just die, and these hospitals will turn into graveyards"". At the Al-Quds hospital, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said its teams were trapped inside alongside 500 patients and around 14,000 displaced people. Meanwhile one of Gaza's smaller hospitals, Al-Rantisi, was largely evacuated - with only a handful of patients and staff inside. The Gaza Strip is home to 2.2m people, but since the start of the war more than 1.5m people have been displaced, according to the UN's agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA). Hamas killed an estimated 1,200 people inside Israel on 7 October - many of them civilians - and took more than 200 others hostage. Israel's response inside Gaza has killed more than 11,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says that figure includes more than 4,500 children. In an interview with the BBC on Friday,French President Emmanuel Macron said Israel must stop killing Gaza's women and babies. Mr Macron called for a ceasefire and hoped other leaders - including the US and the UK - would join him.",2023-11-12T01:50:44.000Z

Macron condemns rising antisemitism and Israeli bombing of civiliansPublished11 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsWar in Ukraine,"Far from a distant observer, one of a chorus of countries offering opinions on the Israel-Gaza war, France feels very much caught up in the conflict. It is home to Europe's largest Jewish community and has the largest Muslim population of any European country. A recent YouGov poll suggested over 70% of French men and women fear Middle East tensions and violence could well spill over at home. There are fears about general security, as well as concerns about antisemitism and Islamophobia. The French authorities have reported a steep rise in antisemitic acts across the country. On Friday, during our wide-ranging conversation at the Élysée Palace in Paris, President Emmanuel Macron spoke about the multiple challenges facing the world today, from climate change to combating global inequality, to the importance of continuing to support Ukraine against Russia. But when it came to the Middle East, the language the French president used was particularly emotive. On a number of occasions he listed the women, the babies, the old people in Gaza who, he said, had nothing to do with terror attacks, being killed in bombings by Israel. He insisted there was no justification for that and the bombing campaigns must stop. Palestinian lives matter, he said, humanitarian law must be respected. In stark contrast to Washington, which has ruled out the idea of a ceasefire for now, Mr Macron repeated over and again during our conversation that to protect Gaza civilians a humanitarian ceasefire was needed. He urged Israel to accept one and said he hoped other world leaders, including in the US and the UK, would make the same case. At the same time as outlining why he believes there should be a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, Mr Macron also spoke with empathy for Israel following the Hamas massacre of about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and the hostage-taking of almost 240 others, including French citizens, just over a month ago. ""We work very hard to try to protect our people there,"" he told me. ""We unhappily lost more than 40 French nationals and we still have hostages and when I speak about that first I think about our families."" Hamas governs Gaza and is designated a terrorist organisation by many Western countries including the UK. Emmanuel Macron told me he was one of the first world leaders to call Israel's president and prime minister. ""We share their pain and we share their willingness to get rid of terrorism. We know what terrorism means in France,"" he said. France has been the focus of a number of Islamist attacks in recent years. Since 2014, more than 260 people have been killed, according to France's Interior Ministry, and 1,200 people injured. Mr Macron said France ""clearly condemned the terrorist attack and the (Hamas) terrorist group and recognised Israel's right to protect itself and to react"". But from Day One, he emphasised, ""France said Israel's reaction must respect the international rules of war and international humanitarian law"". Did he believe Israel was flouting those laws in its military action in Gaza, I asked. The UN Secretary General says Gaza is turning into a graveyard for children. With passions so inflamed across the Middle East as well as in France, Mr Macron said one month after Israel suffered such a devastating attack ""I think it would not be the right way to deal with a partner and a friend, to say you will be condemned and you're guilty. I'm not a judge. I'm a head of state. I just remind everybody of international law. I call for the ceasefire."" A ceasefire would benefit Israel, said Mr Macron, because the images of its military strikes in Gaza, seen around the world, were fuelling resentment. ""It's impossible to explain: we want to fight against terrorism while killing innocent people,"" he said. In reality, President Macron's words have far more impact back home than in the Middle East where, unlike the US, Iran or Egypt, for example, France is not viewed as hugely influential in the Israel-Hamas conflict. In Paris meanwhile, a demonstration planned for this Sunday against antisemitism has become highly politically charged - largely because Marine Le Pen's hard right National Rally party will participate. Mr Macron has called for France to unite ""without ambiguity"" against antisemitism. He said there would be ""no mercy shown in France for those inciting hatred"", but also he has made headlines at home after his team announced he would not attend the demo in person.",2023-11-11T05:09:15.000Z

Gaza casualties: 'Most of the children in my family photo are dead'Published11 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Whole families have been wiped out in Israel's air strikes on the densely populated streets of Gaza, where many Palestinians live in multi-generational homes. Three Palestinians in the UK told the BBC that more than 20 of their relatives had been killed in one blow - and many were still stuck under the rubble. It was just another lazy, sunny Friday afternoon four years ago when Ahmed al-Naouq snapped this selfie with his family. But he remembers it well, especially now. Under the shade of olive trees by his father's house, his sisters and brothers got together with their children to eat, play and chat. Taking a break from running around, the children were ready to eat when Ahmed captured them together. Now, most of them are dead, he says. They were killed in an air strike which struck the family home on 22 October. In total, 21 people were killed including his father, three sisters, two brothers and 14 of their children. More than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli bombardment, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The air strikes began after the 7 October attack by Hamas, in which Israel says about 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage. Israel says its strategy in Gaza has been to root out Hamas which it accuses of operating in the heart of civilian communities - and that it takes steps to mitigate civilian casualties. In Ahmed's photo, only seven of the children who were killed appear. Some weren't there that day, some weren't even born. Like many Palestinians, Ahmed's brothers built their family homes above their father's - a tradition which means generations are being wiped out in one fell swoop. His sister Aya had gone there to take shelter with her children after her own apartment was damaged by an air strike. His other sisters, Walaa and Alaa, were there too with their children. The house was in the centre of Gaza in the town of Deir al-Balah, an area that had never been targeted before. They thought it was safe. ""I thought it's a scary time for them but they will be OK,"" Ahmed says, stunned now by his naivety. Ahmed moved to London four years ago to work for an NGO and hasn't been home since. The last time he saw the children together was by video call. He had been given a bonus and, as part of a family tradition, he promised his nieces and nephews a treat. ""They all said that they want to go to the beach and rent a chalet and have food and dance together and enjoy,"" he says. So, he hired one and bought them dinner and snacks. The children called him from the beach that day, fighting over the phone to talk. So many of them are dead now that Ahmed stumbles as he remembers the names and ages of each one. His 13-year-old nephew Eslam was the eldest and the one he knew best. Ahmed was a teenager and living at home when Eslam was born. His mum looked after the baby while his sister was at work, so Ahmed often helped to feed and change him. As Eslam grew older, he said wanted to be like his uncle. He was the top of his class, Ahmed says and working hard at English so that he could also come to the UK. Eslam was killed alongside his little sisters - Dima who was 10, Tala who was nine, Nour who was five and Nasma who was two, as well as his cousins Raghad (aged 13), Bakr (aged 11), girls Eslam and Sarah who were both nine, Mohamed and Basema who were eight and Abdullah and Tamim who were six. After the attack, Ahmed posted pictures of each of the children online to let the world know what had happened to them. Among them was three-year-old Omar. The little boy had been in bed with his mum Shimaa and dad Muhammed - Ahmed's brother - when the bomb fell. Then Ahmed got a call from one of his surviving sisters: Omar was alive. Ahmed's brother Muhammed had been killed but Shimaa and her little boy miraculously survived. ""That was the happiest moment in my life, ever,"" Ahmed says. The only other person pulled from the rubble alive was 11-year-old Malak. She was badly injured, with burns over half of her body. When I met Ahmed, he showed me a picture of Malak in her hospital bed - her body was entirely covered in bandages. At first, I mistook her for a boy because her hair was short. It must have burned in the fire, Ahmed said. Malak's father wasn't in the house when it was hit and he is alive. But his wife and two other children were killed. When Ahmed messaged him to ask how he was doing, he replied: ""A body, no soul."" A week after the bomb, communications from Gaza were almost entirely cut off as Israel escalated its attack, and Ahmed couldn't contact anyone. When the signal was reconnected two days later, he learned that Malak had died. Medical supplies were dwindling to nothing and the 11-year-old had to be taken off the ICU unit when a more urgent case came in. She was in a lot of pain. ""I died a hundred times every day,"" her father told Ahmed, as he watched the eldest and last of his three children fade away. Just before the communication blackout, Ahmed also found out that his uncle's house had been hit. He's still not sure who was killed there. On Tuesday, he also learned that the home of his close friends Maisara and Laura had been hit. Again several generations were killed - Laura survived but Maisara is still missing underneath the rubble. In all, we spoke to three people in the UK who had each lost more than 20 family members in Gaza. Darwish al-Manaama told the BBC that 44 of his family died. Among them was his niece Salma and her husband, their four adult children and their grandchild who was barely one. Darwish found out his family had died from a list sent to him on WhatsApp. After sharing some details, he was too overwhelmed to talk. Yara Sharif, an architect and academic in London, sent me photos of her aunt's family home which was destroyed in an Israeli strike a week into the war. ""It was a very beautiful house,"" Yara says, ""A beautiful mansion with a big courtyard in the middle."" Like Ahmed's family, the sons built apartments for their own families on top of their parents. Yara found out that 20 of her relatives had been killed on Facebook - her aunt and uncle, her two cousins and their 10 children, as well as six members of the extended family. Some of their bodies were pulled from the rubble and they appear as numbers on the list of dead released by the Ministry of Health. Yara sent us a screenshot of the list with a rough red mark by each name and, on the right-hand side, their ages. Sama was 16, Omar and Fahmy were 14-year-old twins, Abdulrahman was 13, Fatima 10, Obaida seven, cousins Aleman and Fatima were both five, Youssef was four and Sarah and Anas were three. Yara has two cousins left. They asked not to be named, worried by an unsubstantiated rumour that those who speak to the media are being targeted. The sisters are in different parts of Gaza and can't reach each other to hold a funeral or grieve. And anyway, as Yara's cousin messaged her: ""Muhammed's body and Mama's and the two children are still under the rubble."" There is not enough fuel to run excavator machines in Gaza and any that are working are needed to rescue those who are alive. On Friday, as I sat with Ahmed al-Naouq watching the news, the list of the dead scrolled down the screen. I asked him if his family were on it. ""Only 12 of them,"" he said. The other nine hadn't yet been recovered. After the bombing, his oldest sister, who was at her own home when it happened, went to visit the ruins. But she told Ahmed she couldn't stay long because she couldn't stand the smell of rotting flesh. Ahmed struggles to keep in touch with his surviving sisters. Often phones aren't working, and he loses touch with them. He struggles to find the words in English to describe what he has been feeling since the bombing, saying it feels as if his heart is no longer in his chest. Crying is pointless, he says, because it changes nothing. ""I feel like I can't stand still. I can't sit still. I can't sleep at night,"" he says. ""There's nothing you can do to stop this feeling."" Ahmed says his father was the kindest man he had ever known. He worked hard driving a taxi and in construction to build a home for his children and educate them well. He listened obsessively to the news and believed the only solution to this conflict was a one-state solution, where Jews and Palestinians would live alongside each other in peace. But thinking of his only surviving nephew, Ahmed wonders: after this war has taken so many people he loves, what will Omar believe? Additional reporting by Husna Wahid",2023-11-11T01:16:27.000Z

Israeli forces surround north Gaza hospitalsPublished11 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Shelling, gunshots and explosions took place outside Gaza City hospitals on Friday as Israeli forces continued their ground operation against Hamas. Social media videos showed panicked and injured people running for cover. Israel has always maintained that Hamas fighters hide in tunnels under hospitals, making the structures legitimate targets. The Red Cross warned that hospitals in Gaza had ""reached a point of no return"". It added that its staff attempting to deliver medical supplies had witnessed ""horrendous"" scenes, and described the destruction as ""unbearable"". In Gaza as a whole, the Hamas-run health ministry says 11,078 people have been killed since the start of the war and more than 27,000 others have been injured. Israel's bombardment of Gaza and ground operations followed Hamas's unprecedented mass attack on southern Israel on 7 October. On Friday evening, Israel revised down the number of people killed during the attack to about 1,200, from the earlier figure of 1,400. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said the revised number was because many bodies were not immediately identified after the attack, and ""now we think those belong to terrorists... not Israeli casualties"". Reports that Israeli forces in Gaza were surrounding several hospitals in Gaza City began to emerge early on Friday morning. One person inside the Al-Quds hospital told the BBC that they could hear ""continuous clashes and explosions"", while eyewitnesses near the Al-Rantisi Paediatric Hospital said that Israeli troops were using megaphones to order anyone who was not medical staff or patients to leave the premises. In one video posted on social media and verified by the BBC, a large group of civilians - many of them carrying white flags - can be seen trying to leave the courtyard of another hospital, Al-Nasr, when gunshots ring out, sending panicked people running for cover. Videos posted on social media appeared to show the aftermath of a missile or mortar striking the courtyard at Al-Shifa, the city's largest hospital, while others appeared to show dead children and scenes of panic outside the outpatients' clinic. Dr Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, said that up to five Israeli strikes had damaged parts of Al-Shifa hospital, including the maternity ward. ""If Al-Shifa hospital goes out of service it will be a disaster for the people of Gaza City,"" Dr Al-Qudra said, adding that staff were afraid. The Hamas government reported 13 deaths at Al-Shifa, while Dr Al-Qudra said he knew of one fatality but could not confirm any others. By Friday evening, tensions in Gaza City remained high. People inside Al-Shifa said they could still hear explosions and firing around the hospital and that Israeli tanks were about 100m (328ft) away. The director of the hospital told the BBC that around 15,000 people remained in the structure - largely the elderly and the sick who cannot make the journey further south to where Israel has promised greater safety. He added that staff were overwhelmed by the number of injured people and were having to treat people in corridors and on the floor. The fighting around Al-Quds hospital also intensified as night fell. The BBC understands an Israeli navy ship was involved as well as tanks, which have surrounded the hospital. Speaking at the UN Security Council on Friday, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the situation on the ground in Gaza was ""impossible to describe"". Dr Tedros said that hospital corridors were ""crammed with the injured, the sick, the dying"", that morgues were ""overflowing"", and that surgeries was being performed without anaesthesia. He added that half of the Gaza Strip's 36 hospitals were not functioning at all, and that the remaining ones were operating ""way beyond their capacities"". He said that civilians in Gaza ""are not responsible for this violence, but are suffering in ways that we in this room cannot imagine."" A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the IDF ""does not fire on hospitals"" but that ""we'll do what we need to"" if Hamas fired from hospital grounds. When asked what the plan was to deal with patients in the hospitals who could not walk, or those who were on drips and with broken bones, he said: ""Our plan is - and we're taking an operational risk here - we're saying to Hamas to move people south."" Hamas has previously denied claims that it places command posts under Gaza hospitals to use them as shields. The US says Israel has agreed to daily four-hour military pauses in northern Gaza for humanitarian purposes - yet the fighting remained intense on Friday.",2023-11-11T00:33:37.000Z

Macron calls on Israel to stop killing Gaza's women and babiesPublished11 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel must stop killing babies and women in Gaza, French President Emmanuel Macron has told the BBC. In an exclusive interview at the Élysée Palace, he said there was ""no justification"" for the bombing, saying a ceasefire would benefit Israel. While recognising Israel's right to protect itself, ""we do urge them to stop this bombing"" in Gaza, he said. But he also stressed that France ""clearly condemns"" the ""terrorist"" actions of Hamas. France - like Israel, the US, the UK, and other Western nations - considers Hamas a terrorist organisation. When asked if he wanted other leaders - including in the US and the UK - to join his calls for a ceasefire, he replied: ""I hope they will."" After a month of Israeli bombardment and nearly two weeks after Israel launched a major ground offensive into the territory, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Friday that 11,078 people had been killed, while 1.5 million had fled their homes. Israel says it attacks military targets in line with international law and takes steps to reduce civilian casualties, like issuing warnings ahead of strikes and calling on people to evacuate. Speaking the day after a humanitarian aid conference in Paris about the war in Gaza, Mr Macron said the ""clear conclusion"" of all governments and agencies present at that summit was ""that there is no other solution than first a humanitarian pause, going to a ceasefire, which will allow [us] to protect... all civilians having nothing to do with terrorists"". ""De facto - today, civilians are bombed - de facto. These babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed. So there is no reason for that and no legitimacy. So we do urge Israel to stop."" He said it was not his role to judge whether international law had been broken. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded quickly to Mr Macron's comments, saying nations should condemn Hamas, not Israel. ""The crimes that Hamas [is] committing today in Gaza will be committed tomorrow in Paris, New York and anywhere in the world,"" a statement from Mr Netanyahu's office read. In a wide-ranging interview at the end of the first day of an annual Paris Peace Forum, President Macron also discussed: Starting by discussing Gaza, Mr Macron said France ""clearly condemns"" Hamas's attacks on Israel on 7 October which sparked the war. Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 240 others hostage in its unprecedented cross-border assault it launched that day. ""We do share [Israel's] pain. And we do share their willingness to get rid of terrorism. We know what terrorism means in France."" But he said there was ""no justification"" for the ongoing bombing of civilians in Gaza. ""It's extremely important for all of us because of our principles, because we are democracies. It's important for the mid-to-long run as well for the security of Israel itself, to recognise that all lives matter."" When asked, he refused to say that Israel had broken international law in Gaza. ""I'm not a judge. I'm a head of state,"" he said, adding it would not be right to criticise Israel in this way - ""a partner and a friend"" - just a month after it was attacked. But Mr Macron said he disagreed that the best way for Israel to ""protect [itself] is having a large bombing of Gaza"", saying it was creating ""resentment and bad feelings"" in the region that would prolong the conflict. Israel has said it will start daily four-hour military pausesin parts of northern Gaza as it continues its offensive. Its defence minister however stressed the pauses would be ""localised"" and would ""not detract from the war fighting"". Ahead of a march against antisemitism on Sunday which a large section of France's political class will attend, President Macron called on all French citizens to condemn antisemitic acts ""without ambiguity"". He said France had probably Europe's biggest Muslim community and a big Jewish community too, and with France and the rest of Europe seeing a big rise in antisemitism, all French citizens had to be united against antisemitism, and had to ""share the pain or the compassion of Palestinians"". Analysis:Macron condemns rising antisemitism and Israeli bombing of civilians Mr Macron then moved on to other global issues, including Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He said if Russia were allowed to win its war, ""you will have a new imperial power"" in Europe, that could threaten other former Soviet states like Georgia and Kazakhstan, as well as the whole continent. ""Because, definitely, it's imperialism and colonialism that Russia is doing [in Ukraine],"" he said. The French president said it was the ""duty"" of his country and all countries to support Ukraine in its defence. But he also said the next month would be critical, as it struggles to retake lost land in counteroffensive operations. He said it was ""not yet"" time for Ukraine to come to the table, and stressed the decision to negotiate was Kyiv's alone. But he added there may come a time to ""have fair and good negotiations, and to come back to the table and find a solution with Russia"". Mr Macron also discussed online extremism - a key topic at the Paris Peace Forum. He singled out Facebook's parent company Meta and Google, saying the companies ""simply don't deliver"" on promises they made to moderate hate speech on their platforms. He said many online platforms lacked sufficient moderators for French language content, calling it a ""shame"", and promising to ""push them"" on the issue - although he said TikTok had improved the number of moderators for its French language content. And he said that climate change was causing terrorism in parts of the world, specifically mentioning the effects of global warming in lower water levels at Lake Chad in West Africa. ""As a consequence of climate change, a lot of families living as fishermen [suffered]... A lot of species just disappeared. And it created politics [that] pushed a lot of people to terrorism."" But when asked if he ever felt depressed by the sheer number of issues facing the world, Mr Macron said he saw it as ""a chance and an honour to have responsibilities [as head of state]"". ""We need international cooperation [to tackle global issues]... This is a unique chance.""",2023-11-11T00:15:27.000Z

News outlets deny Israeli claim that freelance journalists knew of Hamas attackPublished10 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A number of news outlets have strongly rejected Israeli accusations that four freelance photographers they worked with in Gaza had prior knowledge of the Hamas attacks on 7 October. Israeli minister Shlomo Karhi said ""certain individuals"" who had worked for Reuters, AP, CNN and the New York Times ""had prior knowledge"". All four outlets have denied the claims, which have since been debunked. The NYT said the ""outrageous"" accusations endangered freelancers. Hamas launched devastating and unprecedented attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers, and kidnapping more than 240. Mr Karhi's commentsfollowed a report on the pro-Israel website Honest Reporting, which suggested - without supporting evidence - that the photographers' presence may have been ""part of the plan"". It said that the presence of the photographers on October 7 in the early hours of the attacks ""raised ethical questions"". However, Gil Hoffman, Honest Reporting's executive director, has since confirmed the lack of evidence. AP quoted him on Friday as saying he was satisfied by explanations given by some of the journalists that they had no prior knowledge. But he maintained that the site's questions were ""legitimate"", adding that ""we don't claim to be a news organisation"". Images filed by the photographers included a burning Israeli tank, Palestinians breaching a fence at the Kfar Aza kibbutz and scenes from the attack itself. In a statement made on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Israeli government's press office said the website's ""disturbing findings"" showed the photographers had crossed ""every professional and moral red line"". Reuters, AP, CNN and the New York Times all issued statements saying there had been no arrangements in advance with any of the journalists to provide photos. The New York Times described the accusations as ""reckless"". ""The Times has extensively covered the Oct. 7 attacks and the war with fairness, impartiality, and an abiding understanding of the complexities of the conflict,"" it said. It also defended the work of freelance photojournalists in conflict areas, adding their jobs ""often require them to rush into danger to provide first-hand witness accounts and to document important news. ""This is the essential role of a free press in wartime."" It said one of the photographers, Yousef Massoud, had not been working with the paper on that day but had ""since done important work for us"". Associated Press said: ""No AP staff were at the border at the time of the attacks, nor did any AP staffer cross the border at any time."" ""When we accept freelance photos, we take great steps to verify the authenticity of the images and that they show what is purported,"" it added. The agency said it was no longer working with one of the journalists, Hassan Eslaiah, who was found to have been pictured with Hamas Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar. CNN said it had no prior knowledge of the attacks, but said it also would suspend its ties with Eslaiah. Reuters also denied that it had prior knowledge of the attack or had ""embedded journalists with Hamas"" on 7 October. On Thursday, Honest Reporting said they ""did not accuse Reuters of collusion"" but was rather raising ""serious ethical issues regarding news outlets' association with these freelancers"". After the website's initial report, Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said the photojournalistsshould be treated as terroristsif it was proven they knew in advance of the 7 October attacks. An MP for the ruling Likud party, Danny Danon, also said the journalists would be added toa list of people marked for assassinationbecause of their participation in the attacks. Journalists are protected under international law which says they must be treated as civilians and protected as such during conflicts. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says at least 39 journalists and media workers have been killed since the current war began, including 34 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese.

Israel-Gaza: Union members block arms factory in protest over conflictPublished10 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hundreds of trade union members blockaded a factory which manufactures weapons in protest over the Israel-Gaza conflict. Demonstrators blocked entrances to the BAE Systems site in Rochester, Kent, at about 07:00 GMT on Friday. They claim the factory provides components for military aircraft being used to bomb Gaza. A spokesperson for BAE said: ""We respect everyone's right to protest peacefully."" The blockade was organised as part of an International Day of Action for Palestine. Members are calling for ""an end to the UK government's complicity in war crimes being committed in Palestine"", which includes an end to arms sales to Israel and support for an immediate ceasefire. The Ministry of Defence declined to comment. In a statement, activists said the UK industry - which includes the site being blockaded - ""provides 15% of the components in the F35 stealth combat aircraft that are currently being used in the bombardment of Gaza"". One organiser said more than 400 trade unionists were involved in the action at the site. They said the group included health workers, teachers, hospitality workers, academics, artists and more who are members of eight trade unions. Alexandra, a teacher and member of the Nation Education Union, explained why she joined the blockade. ""As a teacher, seeing 185 schools and other educational institutions in Gaza bombed is utterly heart breaking."" She added: ""We're here today to disrupt the Israeli war machine and take a stand against our government's complicity and we urge workers across the UK to take similar action in their workplaces and communities."" Harriet, an A&E doctor, said the blockade aimed to turn workers away and prevent deliveries getting in and out of the factory. She said: ""I'm here because I'm a person. I'm also here because I'm a medic and we've seen hundreds of medical staff in Gaza killed, some still under the rubble. Jeanine Hourani, from the Palestinian Youth Movement and the University College Union, said the demonstration is part of a ""global, transnational movement"" that aims to end the arms trade to Israel. She said: ""We're here as British workers to say unequivocally that we do not accept the use of British labour in the war crimes that are currently being perpetrated in Palestine."" A BAE Systems' spokesperson said they were ""horrified"" by the situation in Israel and Gaza and the ""devastating impact it's having on civilians"". ""We respect everyone's right to protest peacefully. We operate under the tightest regulation and comply fully with all applicable defence export controls, which are subject to ongoing assessment."" Kent Police said the demonstration remained peaceful with no arrests, and dispersed at 14:10 GMT.

Three women deny showing pictures in support of HamasPublished10 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Three women have denied showing pictures in support of Hamas during a march in October. Heba Alhayek, 29, Pauline Ankunda, 26, and Noimutu Olayinka Taiwo, 27, were charged for inviting support for a proscribed organisation. They were alleged to have carried or displayed ""an image displaying a paraglider"" at a pro-Palestinian protest in Whitehall on 14 October. There was a ""clear"" association between the image and Hamas, the court heard. Ms Alhayek and Ms Ankunda, both from Crystal Palace, south-east London, were each charged on 14 November. And Ms Taiwo, from Croydon, south London, was charged with the same offence on Thursday. The three appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday as co-defendants and were granted unconditional bail ahead of a two-day trial due to start on 12 February 2024. Prosecutor Mark Luckett said: ""The prosecution say that there is a clear and unique association between the image of a paraglider and the Hamas terrorist attack a week earlier."" He added that wearing an item of clothing displaying an image associated with the Hamas attacks ""glorifies the actions of the group by celebrating the unique, successful tactic used by them"". Militants from the group, classed as a terror organisation by the UK government, used paragliders to enter Israel from Gaza on 7 October before killing more than 1,000 Israelis. The offence they are each accused of falls under the Terrorism Act 2000. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London onSoundsand follow BBC London onFacebook,XandInstagram.

'Her life is painkillers' - The Gaza children ravaged by warPublished10 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Nehad Abu Jazar sings softly as she tries to comfort her two-year-old girl Fatima. But it is hard to imagine what will soothe her child when the reality of what has happened is so devastating. ""On 17 October we were awakened by the sound of bombing and found ourselves trapped under rubble. Fatima had been in my lap but she managed to get out of it. When I got up to help her, I saw that both her legs had been crushed,"" she says in an interview filmed for the BBC by freelance journalists in Gaza. Fatima's legs had to be amputated from below the knees. Sitting in her mother's lap in the European Hospital in southern Gaza, Fatima's face is streaked with tears, her legs are wrapped in white bandages, and she cries as if she's in pain. Nehad and her husband had tried for 14 years to have a baby. And then Fatima was born. ""I'm truly grateful that she survived. But what is her fault? What has she done wrong? I want her to have a normal life like other children,"" Nehad says. ""Right now we are constantly giving her painkillers. When the effect of one wears off, we give her another. Her life revolves around painkillers. And every other day she undergoes surgery."" A month of intense bombardment on Gaza - Israel's retaliation for a devastating attack by Hamas that killed about 1,200 people - has taken a terrible toll on its residents. At least 10,800 people have been killed, including more than 4,400 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. Israel disputes the accuracy of the numbers, but the World Health Organization believes the figures are trustworthy. More than 26,000 people have been hurt, many of them, like Fatima, left with life-changing injuries. In a room next door lies 13-year-old Amira Al-Badawi. She has striking light brown eyes and dark hair. ""I was sleeping when we were bombed. I woke up not able to breathe. I could hear people's sounds. There were rocks above and under me,"" she says. Amira has suffered severe injuries to her spine and it's not clear if she will be able to walk again. The strike killed her mother and seven of her brothers. Her father, Iyad al-Badawi, says they had fled their home in Al-Zaytoun after warnings from the Israeli military, and moved to Rafah in southern Gaza. That's where, he says, they were bombed. Israel has been telling Gazans to move south for their own safety, but it has also continued to bomb central and southern areas of Gaza. It says it will hit Hamas targets wherever they are. ""I was taken to hospital, and there one after another I heard about my children and wife being killed. We raised them, educated them, some were married. And now we've ended up losing them,"" Iyad says. He says he is thankful that his 18-month-old son and three of his daughters had survived. ""I ask for peace and security,"" Amira says. ""I want to be treated for my injuries and go back to my normal life, to my home. I want to feel safe again."" But there's no home to go back to. And nowhere in Gaza is safe. The hospitals fill up with the dead and wounded, a large number of whom are children. Assef Abu Mazen lived by the beach in Al-Nuseirat. The 11-year-old played football at the neighbourhood club. He started off as a defender but then was made his team's goalkeeper. Assef says he was playing football with his friends when an air strike destroyed his home and permanently changed his life. His right leg had to be amputated below the knee. It's still heavily bandaged. ""I'm only 11 years old. I haven't harmed anyone. What's my fault?"" Assef says. He had wanted to become a professional footballer but that dream is over. ""I was quite good at it, if you want to check you can ask my coach,"" he says. One Friday morning an opponent hit the ball fiercely at an angle, he recalls: ""I made a leap and managed to deflect it back."" The family shares a photograph of Assef in his football kit - a light blue jersey, dark blue shorts, green and black shoes. ""My kit is buried under the rubble of our home. My socks are gone, my shoes, and the football I owned. They've all turned to dust,"" Assef says. He is taken around the hospital complex in a wheelchair by volunteers. The complex is full of makeshift tents, temporary shelters for people fleeing fighting in the north. Assef jokes with the volunteers. Laughter might seem out of place, but it's one way of coping with the fear and grief many Gazans are going through. His mother says that behind the brave face he's putting on is a little boy scared for his future. ""He asks me if his classmates will call him the boy with a severed leg and if they'll make fun of him,"" she says. ""At night, I often find him crying while looking at old pictures of him running or playing football."" Additional reporting by Majdi Fathi and Haneen Abdeen",2023-11-10T15:18:30.000Z

Montreal police probe shots fired at Jewish schoolsPublished10 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Police in Montreal are investigating possible hate crimes after two Jewish schools in the city were hit with gunshots overnight. Bullet holes were found on the doors of both schools on Thursday morning, police said, along with bullet casings. No-one was in the buildings at the time of the shooting and no-one was injured. The incidents have shaken Montreal's Jewish community, who say they are concerned about a rise in hate crimes amid the Israel-Gaza war. ""The Jewish community, with close to 300 years of history in Quebec, is under attack,"" Yair Szlak, head of Montreal-based Jewish organisation Federation CJA, said at a news conference on Thursday. The Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) said they had not found graffiti or messages left behind by the perpetrators, but they are ""not closing the doors at this point on a hate crime situation"". One mother told the Globe and Mail that she pulled her daughter out of class early at one of the schools because she was worried her child would be scared. ""This is a kids' school, it's too much,"" Megan Saleh said. The shootings come after a synagogue and a Jewish centre run by Federation CJA in Montreal's West Island were hit with firebombs. No-one was injured in those incidents, which also happened at night. Eta Yudin, the vice-president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs in Quebec, said the firebombings are a result of ""an importation"" of the conflict unfolding in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. ""We see actions and words in the streets of Montreal targeting the Jewish community. These are not our Quebec values,"" Mr Yudin said. The incidents prompted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to issue a statement on Tuesday that ""antisemitism is completely unacceptable and must always be condemned"". Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante, responding to the shootings, warned perpetrators that they will be prosecuted and that ""every violent and hateful event will be investigated"" by police. ""You will answer for your actions,"" Ms Plante said. Montreal police reported 74 hate crimes and incidents targeting the Jewish community between 7 October, when the war between Israel and Hamas began, and 7 November. Police said they are also investigating 25 hate crimes and incidents reported against the Muslim community in that same period. Some arrests have been made in those cases, they said. The police, who are increasing their presence at places of worship, are ""appealing for calm"",  said Vincent Richer, deputy director of the Montreal police force. Police in other cities across Canada, including Toronto and Vancouver, have also reported a rise in hate crimes.",2023-11-10T15:10:38.000Z

Preston mosques call on Starmer to resign over GazaPublished10 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A city's mosque leaders are urging Labour councillors to ask Sir Keir Starmer to resign for refusing to back a Gaza ceasefire. Preston's ruling Labour group has said it supports a ceasefire but Sir Keir has argued that is ""not the correct position"" at the moment. Preston's 20 mosques have set a deadline of 17:00 GMT for councillors to sign a letter calling for him to go. One of the Muslim community leaders described it as an ""Iraq War moment"". Israel began striking Gaza after the Hamas attacks on 7 October, which saw 1,400 people killed and more than 200 taken hostage More than 10,800 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,400 children. The US said on Thursday Israel would begin to implement four-hour military pauses in areas of northern Gaza each day to allow civilians to flee, although there have beenno immediate reports of a lull in fighting in the Gaza strip. Councillors have been advised by the mosques that the names of those who put pen to paper on the joint letter calling for Sir Keir's resignation ""will be shared with the communities that we serve"". The ruling Labour group on Preston City Council has issued an open response to the mosques, shared with theLocal Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), which reiterates the local party's call for a ceasefire. However, it added that councillors were ""limited in our capacity to influence national and international decision-making"". Mukhtar Master, the Muslim lead on Preston's faith covenant, said that the city's mosques ""could not sit idly by and allow the atrocities [in Gaza] to continue without any opposition"". He told LDRS: ""The Muslim community have historically supported the Labour Party, yet have found the current leader out of touch with public sentiment."" Preston City Council's 31 ruling Labour members broke ranks with the national party almost a fortnight ago by calling for a ceasefire in the conflict - but were still later accused, after a meeting with the Muslim community, of a ""lame"" response to the situation. The Labour group's open response to the mosques' demands added: ""We are in active discussion with all our communities in Preston, including our Muslim community, as we understand the strong feelings that exist regarding this ongoing conflict. ""We have made our position clear that, as a Labour group, we back the call for an immediate ceasefire and [were] one of the first to do so."" Sir Keir Starmer has supported Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's call for a ""pause"" in the fighting in order to allow aid into Gaza and to attempt to get hostages out, but he has said that a ceasefire at the moment wouldsimply enable Hamas to stay in controlof the territory. He previously said his focus was on the Middle East and alleviating suffering, not calls from his own party to resign. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,XandInstagram?

Jewish fears as German support for Israel is challenged on streetsPublished10 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Chancellor Olaf Scholz says he's ""ashamed and outraged"" at recent antisemitic attacks in Germany. He was speaking at an event to mark the anniversary of the November pogroms of 1938, sometimes known as ""Kristallnacht."" Berlin's staunch diplomatic support for Israel is often described as a matter of historic responsibility. But, as fighting continues between Israel and Hamas, social discord is emerging in Germany. I meet a woman called Noa at a Berlin synagogue where she tells me how she has family who survived the Holocaust by hiding in Poland. Some Jewish people in today's Germany, she says, are now hiding their identity. ""It's scary. Why should I live and be afraid of who I am?"" Aaron doesn't feel comfortable showing items traditionally worn by Jewish men in public, either his kippah or histzitzit, the tassels of his prayer shawl. Having fled the war in Ukraine, he believes Berlin is unsafe because ""a lot of people support terrorist organisations"". Fears about a rise in antisemitism, since the outbreak of hostilities between Hamas and Israel, are widespread across Europe. For Germany, incidents such as two petrol bombs being thrown towards a Berlin synagogue in October spark acute anxiety due to the nation's Nazi past. Cases of antisemitism were, according to preliminary police figures, already on the rise this year before the Hamas attacks - the majority committed by the far right. Since 7 October, senior politicians have urged people, particularly from parts of the political left and Muslim backgrounds, to distance themselves from the actions of Hamas. Israel's security is a fundamental cornerstone of German foreign policy with the former chancellor, Angela Merkel, declaring it to be aStaatsräson- reason of state - in 2008. On a recent visit to Israel, Olaf Scholz said: ""In such difficult times there is only one place we can be: at Israel's side."" But Germany's state doctrine is being visibly challenged on the streets of cities like Berlin. ""Yourstaatsräsonsucks!"" read one placard at a recent pro-Palestinian demonstration. This march was permitted to take place whereas many have been banned. Nadim Jarrar, who attended the 9,000-strong demo, tells me he's frustrated by the ""one-sided"" narrative. Half-German, half-Palestinian - he thinks Germany must be more prepared to talk about the actions of Israel. ""It's a healthy process for every nation to get criticised and to have a discussion about what's going on."" Any German discomfort with that debate, he believes, cannot lead to shutting it down. Sami, who has family in the West Bank and lives in Stuttgart, says people must be able ""to show we are in pain about what's happening in Gaza"". ""What's been done to the Palestinians since 1948... We've all seen the videos of what they're doing to our children."" In a widely viewed video message, Germany's vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, said that criticism of Israel is ""of course allowed"" but its right to exist must not be ""relativised"". ""Israel's security is our obligation,"" he said. Some demonstrations have led to violent clashes between police and protesters. The authorities are investigating reports that black and white banners, which are used by jihadist groups and feature the Islamic statement of faith, were flown at a march in the city of Essen. There was outrage when one group, subsequently disbanded by government, appeared to be celebrating the Hamas atrocities of 7 October on the streets of Berlin. Felix Klein, the government's Commissioner for Jewish life in Germany, says it has become apparent that there is a big problem in Germany's integration policy. ""It is problematic when it turns into antisemitic and anti-Israel hate where people shout 'From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free' - which would deny Israel's right to exist."" However, there has been criticism that the messages coming from the government have veered towards stoking anti-Muslim sentiment. Debate about the German government's foreign and domestic positioning is likely to persist for as long as the conflict between Israel and Hamas lasts. ""Every time there's a war in Israel,"" says Noa, ""it just hits us again and again that we are not a full part of the society"". ""We will always be different. We will always be the ones that are not fully German."" There is real anguish in Germany, rooted in its past, that Jewish people don't feel safe. But there is also an anger, bubbling in some communities, about a perceived reluctance by the political classes to break a German taboo and criticise Israel.",2023-11-10T06:01:09.000Z

"Police must remain independent of politics, NPCC chair saysPublished10 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Police chiefs must be able to operate without political interference, one of the UK's most senior officers has said. Gavin Stephens, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) chair, suggested policing could be undermined if ""public debate"" influences decision making. Home Secretary Suella Braverman has accused the police of bias in their handling of pro-Palestinian protests. The move left her facing calls from some within her own party to be sacked by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The Metropolitan Police has faced calls to stop a march set to take place amid remembrance commemorations on Saturday. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has said the demonstration can only be stopped if there is a threat of serious disorder, and that the ""very high threshold"" has not been reached. Mr Sunak has vowed to hold Sir Mark ""accountable"" if there is unrest at the event on Armistice Day, althoughDowning Street has distanced itself from Ms Braverman's comments. The NPCC brings together leaders from forces across the country to coordinate their work on the most significant issues in policing. Speaking to reporters, Mr Stephens said that, ""in policing, we need the space to make difficult operational decisions in an independent manner"". ""The decisions that we take are not easy ones, but we do so impartially, without fear or favour, and in line with both the law and our authorised professional practice,"" he said. Mr Stephens added it was ""really important that the public debate doesn't feature"" in decision making because it could ""fundamentally undermine"" the way policing works in the UK. He argued that language should be used carefully and said he took his responsibility to help defuse tensions ""very seriously"". ""In everything that we do... how we choose to describe that activity in the public arena can set the context in which we police,"" Mr Stephens continued. ""So I consider that as one of my civic responsibilities, that I do what I can to give that reassurance to keep temperatures low, when we are in times of such awful, tragic international conflict that is affecting so many families across across the world."" In an article published in the Times on Thursday, Ms Braverman called those who have taken part in the pro-Palestinian protests of recent weeks ""hate marchers"" and claimed there was ""a perception that senior officers play favourites"" in how they police different demonstrations. ""Right-wing and nationalist protesters who engage in aggression are rightly met with a stern response yet pro-Palestinian mobs displaying almost identical behaviour are largely ignored, even when clearly breaking the law,"" she wrote. The article led to widespread criticism, including from fellow Conservatives, and calls from opposition parties for Ms Braverman to be sacked as home secretary. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper described it as a ""dangerous attempt to undermine respect for police"", while London mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""irresponsible"". One senior Conservative MP told the BBC ""the home secretary's awfulness is now a reflection on the prime minister"" and that ""keeping her in post is damaging him"". Downing Street said it had not cleared the article before publication and that suggested changes to the text were not made. Defending Ms Braverman, Conservative Party deputy chair Lee Anderson said that ""anyone who thinks her comments are outrageous need to get out more"", while policing minister Chris Philp said it was ""reasonable"" for politicians to raise concerns about how policing is conducted.",2023-11-10T04:50:57.000Z

"Weeks into the war, how much closer is Israel to its goal?Published10 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","It's nearly two weeks since Israel launched its ground offensive into Gaza and more than a month since it began intensive air strikes against Hamas, all in response to the brutal attacks in Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed. Israel's stated military objective from the outset has been to destroy Hamas, militarily and politically. How much closer is it to achieving that goal, and is it achievable? As far as Israel is concerned, these are still early days - it has repeatedly said that this operation will be long and difficult. One senior Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official who spoke to the BBC used the analogy of a boxing match: ""This is just round four of 15."" No-one in Israel is saying exactly how long the war will last. Some point to the fact that it took nine months for Western-backed Iraqi forces to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State (IS)group in 2017. Israel may want to carry on fighting for several more months, though it may not control the timetable, as international pressure for pauses in the fighting or even a ceasefire are growing. So far, Israel says it has carried out more than 14,000 strikes and killed dozens of high-value targets, including senior Hamas commanders. Each of those strikes will have involved multiple weapons. Yaakov Katz, a military expert and former editor of the Jerusalem Post newspaper, says Israel has already fired more than 23,000 munitions. As a comparison, at the height of the battle for Mosul, Western allies dropped around 500 bombs a week on IS targets. More than 10,800 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,400 children. The military says its ground forces have successfully divided the Gaza Strip between north and south, and that its troops have surrounded Gaza City. It claims they are now ""deep in the heart of the city"", though that is still far from claiming control. Hamas has denied that Israeli forces have made any significant gains or pushed deep into Gaza City. This initial phase of Israel's ground offensive appears to be going according to plan with its aim of isolating Hamas, and the cost to Hamas is likely to have been high. Estimates at the start of the war suggested that the group had between 30,000-40,000 fighters. One senior Israeli defence source told the BBC that about 10% of that total - 4,000 fighters - have been killed. Such estimates are impossible to verify and should be treated with caution, but the sheer scale of Israel's bombing campaign will have already degraded Hamas's ability to fight. In contrast, Israeli military losses appear to have been relatively low. Israel says 34 of its soldiers have been killed since ground operations began. Yossi Kuperwasser, an Israeli intelligence and security expert, says the military is conducting its ground operations ""more carefully and cautiously"" to avoid heavy casualties among its troops. It's still not clear how much of Hamas remains in the north, how many fighters may still be hiding in tunnels, or how many might have melted into the local population who have fled south. The tunnels still present a significant challenge to Israel. Its forces are trying to blow up what tunnels it finds, rather than engage in fighting underground. More obvious is Israel's significant advantage in terms of intelligence and military capabilities. It can intercept communications and even turn off Gaza's mobile phone and internet networks. It has complete air superiority with Israeli jets and drones able to monitor every movement on the ground, but not below the surface. One senior Israeli defence source told the BBC that they were still identifying more than 100 new targets each day, although that list is likely to diminish the longer this war goes on. The longer it lasts, the more it will have to rely on troops on the ground to identify and eliminate resistance. Justin Crump, a former British Army officer who now runs Sibylline, a risk intelligence company, says Israel appears to be making reasonable progress given the density of the terrain, but ""they're now going to encounter the more heavily defended urban areas of the city"". Israeli troops are better equipped and well-trained, but urban warfare can still prove difficult for the most advanced militaries. So far, close-quarters fighting on the ground appears to have been limited, and is certainly nothing on the scale of the urban warfare that's been taking place between Russia and Ukraine in cities like Bakhmut. Much of the videos released by the IDF show that it is instead relying on tanks and armour. Neither has Israel committed all its forces. Some estimate that it may have as few as 30,000 troops inside Gaza so far. That's a relatively small proportion of Israel's total - 160,000 active military personnel plus 360,000 reservists. Justin Crump says the question is how many of its infantry is it willing to commit to clearing every building and the warren of Hamas tunnels? Israel could instead chose to target Hamas strongholds. He believes Israel will try to avoid block-by-block fighting, not least because it could lead to very heavy casualties. It would also certainly jeopardise the lives of more than 200 hostages. Which raises the question as to whether Israel's stated war aim - destroying Hamas - is really achievable. Even senior Israeli officials recognise that destroying an ideology with bombs and bullets is impossible. Some of the group's leadership isn't even in Gaza. Mr Katz says that if elements of Hamas can survive this war, then they could still claim ""because we're still here, we've actually won"". For that reason, Mr Crump believes Israel's war aims could shift from destroying Hamas to punishing it, to make sure it there is no repeat of the 7 October attacks. Israel is also under increasing pressure to explain what happens next, especially from the US. One Israeli defence source said Winston Churchill wasn't thinking about a Marshall plan to rebuild Germany, when he helped launched the allies invasion on D-Day in the Second World War. But wars are rarely won without a plan post-invasion - something that's been completely absent in Israel's military operation so far.",2023-11-10T01:35:33.000Z

US says Israel to begin daily four-hour military pauses in GazaPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel will begin to implement daily four-hour military pauses in areas of northern Gaza, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. However Israel's defence minister stressed they were only ""localised and pinpoint measures"" that would ""not detract from the war fighting"". President Biden said there would be two ""humanitarian passages"" allowing people to leave areas of fighting. On Thursday heavy fighting was reported around two big hospitals in Gaza City. Meanwhile, pictures once again showed thousands of Palestinians fleeing south from the city and other northern areas. Mr Biden also said the US was trying to increase humanitarian supplies and assistance to Gaza. He said he was aiming for 150 trucks of aid per day to enter the territory. However the UN said the amount of aid entering Gaza was only meeting ""a fraction"" of people's needs and the humanitarian situation was ""intolerable"". A conference in Paris earlier heard repeated appeals for a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel has been bombarding Gaza for over a month and began a major ground offensive almost two weeks ago with the objective of destroying Hamas, which it, the US and other Western powers consider a terrorist organisation. The war began after an unprecedented cross-border assault on southern Israel by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 10,800 people have been killed in the territory since then, while 1.5 million have fled their homes. Mr Biden said Israel was ""fighting an enemy embedded in the civilian population, which places innocent Palestinian people at risk"" but that Israel had ""an obligation to distinguish between terrorists and civilians and fully comply with international law"". On Thursday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had raided Hamas's ""military quarter"" near Al-Shifa Hospital and killed 50 ""terrorists"". A witness said he had also seen tanks opening fire near Al-Quds Hospital. About 2,000 patients and 50,000 displaced people are said to be inside Al-Shifa Hospital, which is located in Gaza City's northern Rimal neighbourhood and is the largest medical complex in Gaza. Its director, Mohammed Abu Selmia,told the Associated Pressthat Israeli troops were about 3km (2 miles) away and that conditions there were ""disastrous in every sense of the word"". In footage filmed inside the hospital on Thursday, a man who was accompanied by two children tells a journalist that they had been walking on a street, trying to flee south, when an Israeli tank opened fire at them. ""The remains of seven or eight martyrs were left at the scene,"" he says. An unverified video posted on social media overnight also purportedly showed a number of people being helped after being hit by shrapnel from a shell on a street close to Al-Shifa. The IDF has previously alleged that Hamas is also operating underground command centres beneath Al-Shifa itself. Hamas and hospital staff have denied the accusation. Fierce battles were also reported on Thursday around Al-Quds hospital, which is 2.3km (1.4 miles) to the south-west in the Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood. Hamouda Musa, 34, told the BBC he and his neighbour had escaped from a building opposite the hospital after he saw four tanks and a bulldozer advancing from the coast, 1km away to the north. ""They were firing intensely towards a nearby residential building,"" he said. ""We fled under a barrage of bullets via a back street. We miraculously came back from the dead."" On Wednesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said that areas in close proximity were struck, injuring patients and displaced people, and damaging buildings. The hospital also said on Wednesday that its main generator had been shut down because of a shortage of fuel, forcing it to close its surgical ward, oxygen generation plant and MRI ward. The clashes and strikes in the north, as well as the struggle to secure enough drinking water and food to survive, has prompted some of the several hundred thousands of civilians staying there to flee southwards in recent days. Pictures from drones showed a stream of people walking along Salah al-Din Road and crossing the Wadi Gaza river, after the IDF opened the route for a sixth consecutive day. An estimated 50,000 people fled the north on Wednesday, which was 10 times more than on Monday. Although the IDF has ordered civilians to move south of Wadi Gaza for their own safety, it has continued to carry out strikes on what it says are Hamas targets in areas where hundreds of thousands have sought refuge. The Hamas-run interior ministry in Gaza said 12 people had been killed and many more injured in an Israeli air strike on a house in the central town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the IDF. While visiting Egypt's Rafah Crossing with Gaza on Wednesday, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said both sides in the conflict had committed war crimes. ""The atrocities perpetrated by Palestinian armed groups on 7 October were heinous, they were war crimes - as is the continued holding of hostages."" ""The collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians amounts also to a war crime, as does the unlawful forcible evacuation of civilians. The massive bombardments by Israel have killed, maimed and injured in particular women and children,"" he added. Israel has insisted it has been acting in complete compliance with international law and that it has done everything possible to minimise civilian casualties. It has also rejected the UN's warnings of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, arguing that there is sufficient food, water and fuel despite the ""complete siege"" it imposed in response to Hamas's attack, and has rejected its calls for a ceasefire unless the hostages are released. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, told the Paris conference on Gaza that there had to be a ceasefire so that more aid could be delivered. He called the volume currently coming through Rafah ""blatantly inadequate"". A total of 756 lorries have crossed from Egypt since 21 October. Before the war, an average of 500 lorry loads entered Gaza every working day from Egypt and Israel.",2023-11-09T23:03:53.000Z

Muslim students at University of Connecticut received threats over Israel-Gaza warPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Muslim students at the University of Connecticut have received violent threats over the Israel-Gaza war and are pushing for protection. At a news conference on Thursday, a former leader of a pro-Palestine campus group played a voicemail she received which included a racial slur. The university's Muslim Student Association said it received an email mocking dead Palestinians, as well. The messages were reported to campus and state police and the FBI. The University of Connecticut, also known as UConn, ""unequivocally condemns Islamophobia, just as it condemns antisemitism and all forms of hatred"", a school spokesperson said. Both Muslim and Jewish groups in the US have recorded spikes in incidents of hate and harassment since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that ignited a war where thousands have been killed. Lena Maarouf said she graduated from UConn in 2022 but her phone number was still listed on the website for a group that she formerly led, Students for Justice in Palestine. The man who left the voicemail message called her a ""terrorist"", used a racial slur and said: ""I can't wait to see you dead."" The call came from an Oklahoma area code, and the threatening email came from a Yahoo email domain, the students said. ""The Muslim community does not feel supported, the Palestinian community does not feel supported,"" Ms Maarouf said during the news conference on the UConn campus in Storrs, Connecticut. ""UConn needs to step up."" Muslim student leaders and the state chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), a Muslim civil rights group, called on the university to provide educational programmes about the conflict and about Islam, and to provide security assurances for Muslim students. ""No young person seeking an education should feel threatened because of their race, religion, background or political views,"" said Farhan Memon, chairperson of Cair's Connecticut chapter. In a statement, UConn spokesperson Stephanie Reitz said the school recognises the concern about the messages, and that a teach-in on the conflict was held on campus last week. ""We recognize the concern generated by the messages, and we join others in condemning the hateful sentiments in the strongest terms,"" Ms Reitz said. The BBC has contacted the FBI's Connecticut office for comment. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said last week that he is organising a meeting of university security officials on dealing with hate crime on college campuses across the state. On Thursday, Cair said it received 1,283 complaints in the month after the Hamas assault on Israel on 7 October, compared to 63 reports in the month of August. The incidents included threats, use of weapons, and a knife attack outside Chicago which killed a six-year-old boy and seriously injured his mother. Last month the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organisation, said that it had recorded 30 incidents of anti-Semitic harassment, vandalism and assault in the weeks after the 7 October Hamas attacks, an increase of nearly 400% over the same period last year. Last month a student at Cornell University in New York State was arrested after allegedly posting violent threats against Jewish students. Prosecutors say Patrick Dai, 21, made threats to bring a gun to the Cornell University campus and rape Jewish women and ""behead any Jewish babies"".",2023-11-09T21:25:33.000Z

Five arrested after pro-Palestinian protest at Scottish ParliamentPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Five people have been arrested after a group of pro-Palestinian protesters occupied the roof of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. The activists demonstrated with a large hand-painted sign which read ""Stop arming Israel"". A large Palestinian flag was also attached to the front of the building in a prominent position. Police Scotland officers closed off the area in front of the building and spoke to the protesters. The force confirmed the arrests after the group was escorted from the roof at about 16:00. The incident came ahead of First Minister's Questions in the Holyrood chamber. As reporters shouted questions to the protesters, one member of the group said: ""We're here to put pressure on the Scottish government to take action against arms exports to Israel. ""The occupation of Palestine is illegal, what's happening right now is genocide."" The group of people, who had their faces covered, did not say if they were part of any organisation. A Scottish Parliament spokesperson said there was no disruption to parliament business and public access to the building was unaffected. The protest ended with the protesters led away by police officers. They were questioned and searched by officers in a car park area of the Scottish Parliament before being driven away in a police van. According to theCampaign Against Arms Trade, the UK government has licensed more than £400m worth of arms to Israel since 2015. In response, a Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: ""We can and do respond quickly and flexibly to changing international circumstances. ""All licences are kept under careful and continual review and we are able to amend, suspend, refuse or revoke licences as circumstances require."" Large pro-Palestinian protests have been held in recent days in both Glasgow and Edinburgh, with activists occupying both Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh Waverley train stations. Marches have been taking place across the UK to urge an end to Israeli attacks in Gaza. First Minister Humza Yousaf, whose parents-in-law escaped from Gaza last week after four weeks under Israeli siege, has backed the right of protesters to hold further events on Armistice Day on Saturday. It came after Home Secretary Suella Braverman described a planned pro-Palestinian event in London on Armistice Day as a ""hate march"". Border crossings in and out of Gaza had been closed since 7 October, when Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, attacked Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage. Since then Israel has been carrying out military action in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 10,000 people have died.",2023-11-09T21:04:41.000Z

Jenin raid: 14 Palestinians killed in clashes in West Bank cityPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Fourteen Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry says. It said at least 20 others were injured in the assault, which residents said involved two drone strikes. It is one of the deadliest recent incidents of its kind in Jenin, which has been repeatedly raided by Israel as part of a drive against militants. The Israeli military said it had sent in undercover units to arrest suspects. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched an assault on the camp overnight, using armoured bulldozers to destroy homemade bombs. Troops came under fire and a drone was used to attack a group of gunmen, the IDF said. The bulldozers ripped up the already badly damaged streets. The IDF said troops re-entered the camp hours later, coming under renewed gunfire. Another drone was used to attack gunmen again, it said. During the clashes, the air force reportedly dropped leaflets telling residents: ""The IDF remains here and will return again and again until terrorism is completely eradicated. Stay away from terrorism, live in peace,"" the Jerusalem Post newspaper reported. The Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly arrest raids across the West Bank for a year and a half, following a wave of deadly attacks by Palestinians which killed more than 30 Israelis. According to the UN, this year more than 400 Palestinians - both militants and civilians - have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank, making it the deadliest there since the UN began recording Palestinian fatalities in 2005. A number of Palestinian attackers have come from Jenin, which has become a major base for Palestinian militants in the West Bank. Four Palestinians were killed in other parts of the West Bank, Palestinian health officials said. Israeli-Palestinian tensions in the West Bank, which were already high, have been fuelled further by the war in Gaza, which began after an unprecedented deadly attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen on 7 October. More than 150 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed in the West Bank since the war began.",2023-11-09T19:20:13.000Z

Ecologist tracks birds of prey to find Israeli deadPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An ecologist is using birds of prey to help Israel's army recover dead bodies at the sites where Hamas attacked on 7 October. Ohad Hatzofe, of Israel's Nature and Parks Authority, tracks the migratory patterns of numerous birds using GPS tracking devices. His data helped to locate four corpses after he was asked for help on 23 October. Another bird found a few other locations of interest, Mr Hatzofe said. The Israeli ecologist said he first reviewed the data of a white-tailed eagle that had been born in Israel. It was hatched in the country in an effort to reintroduce the bird after its species' extinction in the region. It had just returned very hungry from a long migration north of Moscow and proved to be a keen searcher. Mr Hatzofe reviewed its movements and chose certain positions where it had stopped. He then shared that data with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which found the four corpses. The IDF did not respond to BBC News' request for comment. An estimated 1,500 Hamas gunman breached the Gaza Strip's perimeter fence in southern Israel on 7 October and systemically attacked nearby Jewish communities and military posts. An outdoor music festival was also targeted. The attacks saw more than 1,400 people killed, and more than 200 people were taken hostage. More than 10,800 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,400 children. Mr Hatzofe said he tracks where the birds stop with GPS tracking devices. While the trackers do not have video, they can tell him how the bird is moving, what elevation it is at and other data points that can suggest areas of interest. He then cross-references that information with satellite imagery. The ecologist said it was very fulfilling to help the effort, particularly as it can help answer lingering questions for the victims' families. ""To live in this uncertainty and know that some might never be found is the worst thing on earth,"" he said. Mr Hatzofe is also living in that uncertainty. He said his friend Ohad Yahalomi and Yahalomi's 12-year-old are still missing after Hamas attacked their home in Nir Oz, a kibbutz in southern Israel. Mr Yaholomi was shot during the assault and has not been seen since. His wife, who has spoken to the press, and two youngest children were able to escape. ""It is very sad,"" said Mr Hatzofe, who hopes to soon join the search for the dead in person. He also hopes that the war will end soon, as it has caused harm to Israelis and Palestinians. But while many in Israel can disagree about politics in times of peace, he emphasised that they work together during wartime. ""When there is danger, we are all working together toward the same goal,"" Mr Hatzofe said. There are few remaining to do the work that Mr Hatzofe does since Hamas's attack, because so many of his colleagues have been called up for military service. So for now, he said he is happy to ""use my knowledge of the movement of birds and their behaviour to help wherever we can"".",2023-11-09T19:02:06.000Z

Israel sees 'sign of life' in Gaza hostage videoPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group has posted videos of two Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The group said it was prepared to release a 77-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy for humanitarian and medical reasons, but only if ""appropriate measures"" were met. Israel described the videos as an important sign of life, but declined to say whether they would be released. That would play into the captors' ""psychological terror"", it said. In the video, the two hostages are seen addressing the camera. The woman, Hanna Katsir, a woman in her 70s, is seen sitting in a wheelchair. She was abducted from kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October, when Hamas attacked Israel. The second is a teenage boy from the same community. Both hostages sharply criticise Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. It is unclear whether they are reading from a script. The BBC will not be broadcasting the clip itself, which is more than three minutes long. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and the BBC does not broadcast material which may have been filmed under duress. Earlier, the Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, dismissed reports that a deal to free some of the hostages held in Gaza might be imminent. The Israeli military says that 242 people are being held hostage in Gaza. Four hostages have been released and another was freed by Israeli forces. Hamas says it has hidden the hostages it holds in ""safe places and tunnels"" within Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have previously said the hostages include 20 children and between 10 and 20 over-60s. Mr Herzog said on Thursday he had not seen any substantial information on the subject of possible releases. He spoke as the Qatari prime minister hosted a meeting in Doha with the heads of the CIA and Mossad, during which they reportedly discussed the possible terms of a deal for more hostages to be freed. Meanwhile two senior Hamas officials, Ismail Haniyeh and Khaled Meshaal, arrived in Cairo, where reports suggested they met the head of Egyptian intelligence Abbas Kamel. Qatari and Egyptian networks have both said that the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, is expected to visit Cairo tomorrow.",2023-11-09T18:57:24.000Z

Daughter of doctor stuck in Gaza blames UK embassyPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The daughter of a Swansea cardiologist is blaming British Embassy staff for him being stuck in Gaza. Ahmed Sabra, a UK citizen who holds a British passport, was visiting Gaza with family when the conflict started. They waited three weeks for the Egypt crossing to open and, while his loved ones were on the approved list of British nationals, Dr Sabra was not. The Foreign Office said it had no control over the authorities involved. Thousands of foreign nationals have been making the same trip but the only those named on a list published daily by the Gaza Border Authority are allowed to cross over. Those on the list must be cleared by both Egyptian and Israeli authorities. Dr Sabra's daughter Haya, 20, said embassy staff didn't act fast enough to help her father who, after a further three days' wait, was still not added to the list. Instead, he and three other UK residents were loaded onto a bus and sent back to the Gaza side on Tuesday. ""We were assured by the embassy that those four people on the bus would not go back to Gaza,"" said Haya. ""The British government team arrived 20 minutes too late to save them. ""They weren't there - if they had been this would not have happened."" The BBC team in Gaza spoke to Dr Sabra on Wednesday after he had crossed back over the border. He claimed embassy staff could still have done something while the bus waited for hours at the Egyptian side of the Rafah Crossing, but they arrived too late. ""They (Egyptian officials) told the two guys from the British Embassy, 'We gave you five hours to sort this out so that your citizens are clear to enter, you didn't do anything',"" said Dr Sabra, adding that despite his journey being delayed until the following morning, subsequent chances were also missed to rectify the situation. ""We were calling everyone from the British Embassy, but nobody turned up to the crossing. ""In the end the officials said, 'We are sorry, we have to send you back'. ""'Your name is not on the list and your embassy needs to sort this out'."" He said he believes the UK government should ""do their duty to protect me"". ""I am a British citizen and I don't believe they did enough, I don't think they even did the minimum. ""The British Embassy sent me back to Gaza - the most dangerous place in the world now. Dr Sabra's medical colleagues have written a joint letter calling on the UK government to do more to help him, and a petition urging the FCDO to do more has been signed by more than 4,600 people. Haya, along with her mother, sister and younger brother, waited in a hotel at Cairo International Airport for their father, but Egyptian officials only let them stay in the country for 72 hours and they were put on a flight back to the UK on Thursday evening. Her last contact with her father was this morning when he urged them to get on the plane. ""I don't know where he is, I don't know if he is safe, I don't know if he has water, if there is bombing nearby,"" she said. ""I don't want to go back to the UK. I don't know how I am supposed to go back without my dad, to this shameful government, knowing they sent him back to a death trap."" A FCDO spokesperson said: ""We're working round the clock to ensure all British nationals in Gaza who want to leave are able to. ""This involves submitting all details of British nationals and eligible dependants to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities. ""The authorities then review all cases and give permissions to cross. ""We remain in regular contact with British Nationals in Gaza to provide them with the latest information, and UK teams are forward deployed to the border to receive anyone leaving.""",2023-11-09T18:17:06.000Z

Gaza war: 'I'm marching for peace this Saturday'Published9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Londoner who is attending a pro-Palestinian demonstration on Saturday says she wants to support peace. Celia Webster, from Muswell Hill in north London, is a Christian and said going is important to her beliefs. It comes amid a political row over the home secretary's claims the Metropolitan Policeapplies a ""double standard"" to its policing of protests. The prime minister has urged organisers to call the event off because it coincides with Armistice Day. Ms Webster, the daughter of a World War Two veteran who helped liberateBelsen concentration camp, said: ""I'm going to go this Saturday, first to the Armistice Day service, and then I'll be going on a peace march."" She says she sees both events as ""really fundamentally linked"", adding: ""Remembrance Sunday is all about armistice which means truce - and that's what the marches are asking for; a ceasefire and a permanent two-state peaceful solution. ""We have a duty to seek peace always, and people died for us in the wars. They gave up their lives, so we have to do what we can and stand up for injustice when we see it."" Asked about her reaction to those who feel similarly to the prime minister,who believes Saturday's march is ""provocative and disrespectful"", Ms Webster said: ""I don't feel that the present government or really the opposition are speaking out enough to try and get people to listen to one another. ""I think it's really important to our society that nobody feels like they're being silenced,"" Ms Webster added. ""Try and think about why people died in wars, it's so that we would have a peaceful society so that people could have a voice. ""To try and stop people from peaceful protest when so many people are being killed or not being fed or having water - I don't understand it at all."" She said she had not seen any extremist views displayed at previous demonstrations she had attended, and had been ""amazed at what a peaceful atmosphere it is and how everybody is looking out for each other, because there are a lot of families with little children"". ""I've met some wonderful people from various Jewish organisations and there are people there of all different faiths and none, so it's been a really really good atmosphere."" She also offered advice for people who are engaging with or talking about the conflict this weekend, saying: ""Pause and try and listen to one another rather than just fire off, because we all tend to do that and think we have to do this splitting of thinking, 'this is right, this is wrong'."" Pro-Palestinian protests have been held in London each Saturday since the Israel-Gaza war began, and the 11 November protest is expected to call for a ceasefire on the Gaza Strip. London imam and broadcaster Ajmal Masroor said ""these are definitely peace marches"" because they are ""calling for an end to hostility"" and ""the killing of innocent people"". He asked why demonstrating on Armistice Day was ""a problem"", because football matches take place and shops remain open. ""Those who laid down their lives, they laid down their lives for freedom and democracy and the end of war, they would be on our side,"" he said. Meanwhile, Rabbi Natan Levy said he supported the right to protest and did not think Saturday's march should be stopped, but the timing of Armistice Day ""pains"" him because ""it is a day when we should be seeking peace and dialogue between people"". ""I don't see these protests as finding those good solid places for Jews and Muslims and people from different opinions to come together,"" he explained.

Football fan's photo gesture for 14-year-old boy in GazaPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A 14-year-old boy in Gaza was able to momentarily ""forget about the bombs"" after a fellow football fan took his photograph to Anfield. Ali fears he will be killed before he has the chance to visit the home of Liverpool FC. His older brother Abubaker arranged the surprise to help put a smile on his face amid the ongoing conflict. Abubaker said his family never imagined this could be possible after reaching out for help on social media. Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking hostages. More than 10,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel responded with air strikes and a ground offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. ""During the war, I was afraid,"" Abubaker said in voice notes sent to the BBC. ""I said at some point, probably all of a sudden, out of the blue, we're going to be bombed and Ali will be killed and I'm going to be killed. ""We're not an exception in this little strip that we're going to be surviving this war yet again. ""We've survived four wars. And this war may not be another one we survive."" In a bid to make his brother's dreams come true, he messaged Ben on The Anfield Talk podcast. ""Ali is so crazy about Liverpool, he's so obsessed with Liverpool,"" said Abubaker. ""He watches every game, he loves the players, he loves Salah, he loves everyone. ""It's his dream to get to Anfield."" Ben quickly agreed to help, adding: ""I will do anything at all from my end if it can help somebody just a little bit."" He arranged for his friend Sajad to print out the photograph, put it in a frame and take it to famous landmarks around the ground. ""I then sent the pictures across to Abubaker and his response was heartbreaking,"" he said. ""He said that he hasn't stopped smiling, and that for a few moments they as a family completely forgot about the bombs and that it's a historic moment in their family history."" Sajad decided to take the picture to the stadium on Wednesday ahead of the latest fixture. ""I'm a lifelong Red and someone lucky to travel to every home and away game,"" he said. ""I wanted to make a fellow Red's dream come true by taking a picture at the ground.

Why Suella Braverman can't stop Palestinian protestsPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"As things stand, there is going to be a potentially huge pro-Palestinian march in London, on Armistice Day - and there is nothing Home Secretary Suella Braverman alone can do to stop it. The reason for that is simple: the law does not tell the Met Police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley to take into account the views of ministers. It tells him to assess the risks to the public - and make a plan accordingly. Since the Gaza conflict began, the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has organised three national protests in London on successive Saturdays that have grown larger week-on-week. It has negotiated with the police over the route and duration of each and abided by conditions. The police have a delicate balancing act to perform in protecting free speech and assembly - and also protecting the rights of others not to be intimidated. The Met says where protesters have supported terrorist groups, broken racial-hatred laws, or committed other offences, they have made arrests. So far, more than 200 have been arrested - each serious in its own terms, including some allegations of support for Hamas - which is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK. But put those numbers in the wider context of public order policing in London. On Monday alone, police arrested 219 Just Stop Oil demonstrators who tried to stop traffic near Parliament. The Extinction Rebellion ""sit-ins"" of more than two years ago saw officers cart away a staggering 4,118 demonstrators. Opponents of the PSC say marchers are chanting deeply antisemitic slogans and providing a cover for extremists. But while individuals can be arrested for hate crime offences, the legal test for banning an event is more complex. The Public Order Act 1986 gives Sir Mark Rowley and other police chiefs the power to apply conditions to marches where they reasonably believe there could be: The PSC has agreed to conditions under that law. Its supporters say they will gather an hour after the two-minute silence on Armistice Day and more than a mile away from the Cenotaph. Their march, ending with a rally at the US Embassy, is planned to go nowhere near the memorial. Rishi Sunak has described holding a march on Armistice Day as disrespectful and a risk to the Cenotaph or other memorials. But given the PSC has repeatedly abided by conditions imposed on its previous marches, the only conclusion the police can reach - unless they get intelligence to the contrary - is that a risk to the Cenotaph won't come from protesters on the march route. And that's why the force has concluded there is no legal justification to ask the home secretary to ban the march. That power can only be used if a police chief believes they cannot prevent ""serious public disorder"". That basically means violent crowds potentially bent on running amok. The police haven't seen that in previous weeks. So if police commanders asked the home secretary to ban the march, the organisers could go to court - and judges would need to see evidence and intelligence proving the serious risk. Do you plan to attend a protest? Get in touch. The last time these powers were used was in 2011 and 2012. The then-home secretary, on the recommendation of the Met, banned the far-right English Defence League (EDL) from marching through Muslim communities. The EDL was considered to be a thuggish mob and marchers would regularly chant racist or Islamophobic slogans. The Campaign Against Antisemitism says the ""River to the Sea"" chant, that will almost certainly be heard on Saturday's march, is deeply offensive and threatening - but the PSC event is not going through Jewish communities - and the Met says that its legal advice is that the slogan can be legitimate free speech in such circumstances. What would happen if the march were banned? The Met believes people would still come to London and stand in the street and peacefully have their say. The police cannot stop them. The last time they tried, it was a fiasco. In March 2021, the organisers of a vigil for murdered Londoner Sarah Everard cancelled the event. They feared they would individually face enormous fines under the then Covid lockdown rules, if they were seen to encourage the gathering. But there was such confusion over whether there was still a right to protest, regardless of the risk of transmitting the virus, that people turned out anyway. They felt so strongly about the horrific murder they wanted to be heard. The Met ended up paying compensation to women who were arrested. So the huge risk is that, even if Suella Braverman got her way, people would not only come out, but they would march independently. That would be twice as hard for police because there would be no organisers on the ground directing events and calling on people to abide by a route and curfew. And then there is the risk of counter-demonstrations. Former Met commander Dal Babu says Ms Braverman's attack on the forthcoming march has emboldened the extreme far right. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, founder of the largely defunct English Defence League under the alias Tommy Robinson, is calling on followers to join him near the Cenotaph. Other less well known figures are doing the same. ""I've never known an occasion for the home secretary to get involved in operational policing at this level,"" says Mr Babu. ""She doesn't understand the law. She doesn't understand the legislation."" So is there anything the home secretary could do to force the Met to ban the march? If Ms Braverman is satisfied that the Met is ""failing to discharge any of its functions in an effective manner"" she can direct the Mayor of London to intervene. But that is a power designed to be used in exceptional circumstances. And she is not allowed to use that power until she has first consulted the inspectorate of police forces, the expert body on how chief constables are performing. Sir Tom Winsor, former HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Ms Braverman had ""crossed the line"". ""The operational independence of the police is not a debatable matter,"" he said. ""The policing protocol order made by this home secretary in June 2023... stresses the operational independence of the police. ""It is the will of Parliament and the government that the police shall not be open to improper political interference that the police must act with impartiality, including political impartiality.""

Home Secretary Suella Braverman criticised for NI 'hate marches' remarkPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The home secretary has been criticised after using Northern Ireland as a point of comparison while referring to pro-Palestinian protests as ""hate marches"". Suella Braverman previously criticised the demonstrations ahead of a march in London this Saturday, on Armistice Day. Ms Braverman described the marches as ""assertion of primacy by certain groups... of the kind we are more used to seeing in Northern Ireland"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called Ms Braverman a ""pound shop Enoch Powell"". The Foyle MP added it was a ""display of aggressive ignorance"" and claimed ""she is deliberately stoking division to bolster her own brand among the Conservative Party's right wing"". A source close to the home secretary told BBC News NI that the comment was a reference to the activities of ""dissident republicans"". Sinn Féin's foreign affairs spokesperson Matt Carthy said the home secretary had ""as much knowledge about the situation in Northern Ireland as she seems to have about the situation in Palestine at the moment"". ""The British government has taken a disappointing stance in my view in respect of the ongoing conflict in Gaza,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""I would argue if British ministers are in the frame of mind where they want to talk about Ireland and the north, the frame of mind they should be in is ensuring the DUP return to Stormont and we get the executive up and running."" Speaking in the House of Commons, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley said there had been ""hand-wringing hypocrisy"" by some of those critical of Ms Braverman. ""I have witnessed Irish nationalists and republicans, which the Home Secretary referred to in her article, running too quickly to the support of Hamas, to Colombian terrorists, to Hezbollah and to a whole host of others,"" he said. ""The Home Secretary is correct to call this out and to see it as she sees it and this House is right to back her."" The grand secretary of the Orange Order told the BBC's Talkback programme he ""would assume"" the home secretary was making a comparison about dissident republican parades. However, he said it would be helpful if Ms Braverman could ""clarify exactly which marches she was actually referring to"". The Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Ms Braverman was ""seeking to exploit the sensitivities of this moment, and an ignorance of Northern Ireland's history, to inflame community tensions for her own leadership campaign"". He described it as ""an appalling new low"", and said she should be sacked by the prime minister. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said that Ms Braverman's ""comparisons to Northern Ireland are pathetic"", describing her comments as the latest ""of a series of cruel comments and oppressive policies"". Writing in The Times, the home secretary stated at the ""heart of the matter"" she does not ""believe that these marches are merely a cry for help for Gaza"". ""Also disturbingly reminiscent of Ulster are the reports that some of Saturday's march group organisers have links to terrorist groups, including Hamas,"" she said. She added organisers intended to use Armistice Day to parade through London in a ""show of strength"". Number 10 has also been asked if it approved of her language. Labour MP Jess Phillips criticised the remarks as ""ignorant from a Conservative and Unionist MP"" and ""breath-taking but not surprising"". A senior Tory source told the BBC that the article was ""wholly offensive and ignorant of where people in Northern Ireland stand on the issues of the the Israel and Gaza"". The government has been embroiled in a row over this weekend's planned march. The prime minister criticised the timing of the demonstration as ""provocative and disrespectful"" and said he would hold the Met Police chief accountable over it. But Sir Mark Rowley rejected calls by campaigners to ban the protest, saying such a move would be a ""last resort"". Organisers insist their march will not go near commemorations and accuse the government of manufacturing tensions. Protests have been held in London, and other cities globally, each Saturday since the Israel-Gaza war began.",2023-11-09T14:01:34.000Z

Maidenhead family ‘devastated’ by uncle’s death in Hamas attackPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A man has spoken of the ""devastating loss"" of his uncle who was killed during Hamas' attack on Israel. David Karol, 72, was caught up in the violence at his home in Kibbutz Be'eri on 7 October. Aaron Kader, from Maidenhead, found out 15 days later his uncle was one of those killed when he was identified through DNA. He said:  ""We still do not know how he died, all we know is that his home was completely burnt to the ground."" Israel has been bombarding Gaza for more than a month and launched a major ground offensive in response to the attack by Hamas gunmenin which 1,400 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage. Mr Karol was born in Israel, he lived with his wife and daughter in the kibbutz. They managed to escape and are now ""safe and relocated"", said Mr Kader. After confirming Mr Karol's death, his nephew said he ""was a huge part of our family, the life and soul of it"". ""He was a larger than life character, who had the ability to make us all laugh,"" he added. ""The hardest part was waiting and hoping to hear if he had managed to escape, hide somewhere or was kidnapped like many others."" Some 240 people are thought to be held: Israelis and foreigners, soldiers and civilians and old and young. Demonstrations andpleas to bring them home are becoming more urgent.

Israel-Gaza war: Dead bodies and tanks on road south as people fleePublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Civilians fleeing intense fighting in northern Gaza have described seeing decomposing bodies and Israeli tanks along a designated ""safe road"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has told people - via social media and leaflets - to use the Salah al-Din road between specific times of day. So what is this journey like? BBC Verify has been looking at video, listening to eyewitness testimony and analysing satellite images to try to get a clearer picture. Before the fighting started, northern Gaza was home to over one million people. It has been heavily bombed and Israeli ground forces are now fighting Hamas there, following the group's attack on Israel on 7 October. Salah al-Din is the main road crossing the length of Gaza and the Israeli military has told civilians to use it as an evacuation route. The road runs past Wadi Gaza, a valley the IDF uses to divide northern and southern Gaza. The IDF has said people will be safer in southern Gaza although its air strikes there have continued. On Wednesday Ahmed Zeyadah told a local journalist filming for the BBC about his journey. He had travelled from his home in the district of al-Nasr in the north. Carrying his toddler, he said, ""I am so tired. We don't know what to do, we don't know where to go. To whom do we turn? To whom do we say: Come and save us."" Mahmoud Ghazzaawi fled his home in al-Zeitoun in northern Gaza because of the number of attacks. He said he left his home at midday and had been walking for five hours. He also said he did not know where to go. ""There are martyrs [dead people] thrown on the ground, may God have mercy on them,"" he said. Most people appear to be walking. According to the UN, the Israeli military reportedly forced evacuees to leave vehicles at the southern edge of Gaza City. Those travelling from the furthest point north walked up to 12 miles (20km). One of the evacuees told UN observers: ""I saw a lot of damage on my way, I saw Israeli tanks and soldiers positioned at the eastern side of the road, near Netzarim, and they did not approach us. ""I saw a few dead bodies and body parts on the road."" In another video, posted on the messaging app Telegram on Tuesday, a woman talked about bodies on the highway. She said she had been looking for her son near the Netzarim junction - named after the former Israeli settlement in Gaza that was located nearby - and described finding his body lying in the road among others as she travelled south. ""I saw the Israeli tanks, but I didn't care, I looked around and found my son. I recognised him by his belt, and his phone,"" she said on the video. The BBC spoke to a local journalist who recognised the woman and said she had visited the Al Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, on Tuesday where she registered the death of her son. He was buried on the same day, he said. The BBC has not found video footage or still images of bodies on the Salah al-Din highway in recent days. We have asked the IDF to comment on the reports of bodies there. The UN estimates up to 15,000 people made the journey on Tuesday, with around 5,000 the day before. On Wednesday the Israeli military said it was opening the road for an extra hour until 15:00 local time because large numbers of people were using it. A military spokesman later claimed as many as 50,000 people had left northern Gaza along Salah al-Din Road on Wednesday. The IDF has published video footage on X showing groups of people walking along the road, some of them waving white flags (to show they are civilians), with an Israeli tank next to the highway and facing them. The BBC has verified the location - by matching distinctive buildings seen in the background of the shot, and it is on the Salah al-Din road about 3km north of Wadi Gaza. Satellite imagery of the highway - posted on 7 November - shows people walking along the same stretch of road and an IDF tank next to it. The image also shows damage to buildings alongside the Salah al-Din road and what appears to be debris on the road. Another satellite image from the same date shows a larger group of people walking along the road around 0.6 miles (1km) north of Wadi Gaza. Israeli tanks have been spotted on this key road before. On 30 October, the BBC verifiedfootage of a tank firing near a car- trying to reverse away - followed by a large explosion. We asked the IDF whether - at the time of this incident - the road has been designated as ""safe"". It would not comment on this specific incident, but said Salah al-Din ""had been an open road throughout the war"" and they had been ""securing it with ground troops and tanks to encourage safe evacuation"". BBC Verify has also analysed satellite imagery of the Salah al-Din Road - as far as Wadi Gaza - to try to assess the level of damage to it during this conflict. Every red dot represents damage of some kind on the road: for example, a crater on the tarmac or a building damaged next to the highway. We have identified about 60 individual examples but we cannot tell exactly when these occurred. The IDF says it makes efforts to avoid harming civilians and will continue evacuation routes.

UK accused of 'whitewash' after Chevening scholar feared killed in GazaPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Palestinian doctor who graduated from a prestigious UK Foreign Office scholarship scheme is feared to have been killed along with most of his family in an Israeli air strike in Gaza, colleagues say. Dr Maisara Al Rayyes, 30, was photographed with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly after meeting him alongside other graduates of the programme two months ago. He was trapped under the rubble of a six-storey apartment building which was razed to the ground in Gaza City on Sunday night. The UK's handling of the case has triggered anger among some Foreign Office staff, the BBC understands, amid wider complaints over a failure to explicitly highlight the spiralling civilian death toll in Gaza. It has also sparked a fierce backlash from some of the medic's former colleagues and scholarship members. Dr Al Rayyes was a graduate of the Chevening Scholarship scheme, an elite programme run by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). The scheme is seen as a pillar of British diplomatic prowess, funding places at UK universities for overseas applicants it describes as global ""leaders and decision-makers"" of the future.  More than 15 Chevening graduates have gone on to become heads of state. The story of Dr Al Rayyes, who won funding for a master's degree in health at King's College London, was embraced by the Foreign Office especially as he met his fiancée, another Chevening scholar, via the programme. In September he was chosen among a select group of graduates to meet the Foreign Secretary in Jerusalem. On Monday, Dr Al Rayyes's parents and a nephew were found dead in the rubble of the family home, friends say, while Dr Al Rayyes himself is yet to be recovered. It has not been possible for BBC journalists to visit the scene to verify what happened on the ground. Videos of the aftermath show the apartment block completely collapsed, with the concrete structure of each floor compressed into the next, forming a vast area of compacted wreckage and tangled metal. The Israeli military declined to respond to questions about the incident. On Wednesday morning, the BBC attempted to make contact with Dr Al Rayyes's younger brother Moayed who was said to have witnessed the strike from a neighbouring house. He was spending a third day along with another sibling searching for Dr Al Rayyes in the rubble. But on Wednesday afternoon while still trying to reach their brother, Moayed and his older sibling Mohammed Al Rayyes were killed in another blast on the street, family friends say. Video showed their bodies on top of the wreckage. A local journalist documenting the rescue scene was also wounded. The Foreign Office on Wednesday said it was ""devastated"" andoffered condolences to the surviving familyand ""Chevening Alumni community"" over the death of Dr Al Rayyes but didn't give any details about what happened to him, or where. The post triggered a storm of criticism from users on X, previously known as Twitter, including from some of his former medical colleagues who accused the UK of trying to avoid any criticism of Israel. The handling of his case also sparked ""huge amounts of discontent"" among some UK officials who felt the death announcement was not placed in context, according to accounts of events described to the BBC. It is also understood ""staff counsellors"" in the Foreign Office have been collating internal concerns raised about the government's position on the Israel-Hamas war, and briefing senior officials on their contents. These have included claims the government has shown a permissive approach to Israel ""breaching international humanitarian law"" given the unprecedented scale of the civilian death toll in Gaza, and that this could damage wider foreign policy, for example, when it comes to highlighting breaches of the global rules-based order by Russia in Ukraine. On Monday, a group representing Chevening graduates in 28 countries wrote to the foreign secretary pleading with him to protect their colleagues and ""focus on the needs and safety of Chevening Alumni"" in Gaza and ""work towards an immediate ceasefire"". One Chevening graduate has since accused the Foreign Office of whitewashing Dr Al Rayyes's death. Hala Hanini, a Chevening graduate and close friend of Dr Al Rayyes, told the BBC it was ""disgusting, disappointing and outrageous"" that the government tweeted its sympathies but did not raise any questions over how he was killed. ""It's as if he just died of normal things,"" she said. ""[UK ministers] claim that Israel has the right to self defence but… it actually has responsibilities over the occupied people to provide them with safety, security… [instead] they are committing genocide and calling it in a false way self-defence,"" she said, accusing the UK of failing to uphold international law. Asked about the concerns raised, the FCDO declined to comment, telling the BBC ""we wouldn't have anything to add beyond the tweet"" about Dr Al Rayyes. In Gaza more than 10,500 Palestinians have been killed in just over a month according to the health ministry in the territory, which is governed by Hamas and has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt since 2007. The UK government has previously given its ""unequivocal"" support to Israel saying it has a ""right to defend itself"" following the 7 October attacks by Hamas which saw 1,400 people killed and more than 240 taken hostage. The UK has also called on Israel to observe international humanitarian law in its response. Israel says its strikes have targeted ""Hamas terrorists and infrastructure"", blaming the group for deaths of civilians by using them as ""human shields"". Many Palestinians accuse the Israeli military of deliberately targeting civilians in order to add to the pressure on Hamas. Israel has said it will not agree to any pause in the fighting until hostages are released.",2023-11-09T12:45:30.000Z

Row erupts over Suella Braverman’s claim of police biasPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A row has erupted over Home Secretary Suella Braverman's attack on the Metropolitan Police for its handling of pro-Palestinian protests. Writing in The Times, Ms Braverman accused the force of applying a ""double standard"" to its policing of protests. She claimed aggressive right-wing protesters were ""rightly met with a stern response"", while ""pro-Palestinian mobs"" were ""largely ignored"". Her comments have been condemned by former police officers and MPs. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is facing calls to sack Ms Braverman, with Labour accusing the home secretary of undermining police independence and ""deliberately creating division"". One senior Conservative MP told the BBC: ""The home secretary's awfulness is now a reflection on the prime minister. Keeping her in post is damaging him."" But the home secretary's allies on the right of the Conservative Party have defended her and argued that a pro-Palestinian march planned for Saturday in central London should not have been allowed to go ahead. Conservative MP Danny Kruger denied Ms Braverman was interfering, and said she was entitled to comment on the ""broader culture of police"". Ms Braverman's comments came after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak held a meeting with Met Police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley to discuss security ahead of Saturday's March, which falls on Armistice Day. Neither Mr Sunak or Ms Braverman have publicly called for the police to ban Saturday's march, but the prime minister has urged organisers to call it off, saying the choice of date was ""provocative and disrespectful"". In an article for The Times, the home secretary claimed that there was ""a perception that senior officers play favourites when it comes to protesters"". The home secretary said the pro-Palestinian marches, which began last month in response to Israel's siege of Gaza, had been ""problematic"" because of ""violence around the fringes"" as well as ""highly offensive"" chants, posters and stickers. ""Right-wing and nationalist protesters who engage in aggression are rightly met with a stern response yet pro-Palestinian mobs displaying almost identical behaviour are largely ignored, even when clearly breaking the law,"" she wrote. The BBC has been told Mr Sunak's team suggested amendments to the home secretary's draft, but not all of them were applied to the eventual article published last night. A government source told the BBC: ""We are not commenting on internal process."" There have been regular protests in London after Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages. Israel has been carrying out strikes on Gaza since then in response, and has now also launched a ground offensive. More than 10,500 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. London's police force has faced increasing pressure to prevent Saturday's pro-Palestinian march from going ahead. But Sir Mark has said it may only be stopped if there is a threat of serious disorder, and that the ""very high threshold"" has not been reached. Plenty of the home secretary's colleagues agree with Ms Braverman on the substance of her article, but they are frustrated by repeatedly having to defend - or distance themselves from - her rhetoric. One government figure told the BBC Ms Braverman's intervention was ""unhinged"". Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper described it as a ""dangerous attempt to undermine respect for police"", while London mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""irresponsible"". ""The PM's weakness when it comes to standing up to Suella is the most shocking thing in all this,"" claimed a senior Labour source. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Sunak ""must finally act with integrity by sacking his out-of-control home secretary"". ""Suella Braverman is now putting police officers in harm's way ahead of far right protesters flocking to the capital this weekend,"" Sir Ed said. He said her remarks demonstrated the ""increasing politicisation of policing"", and how the march is handled should be an operational matter for officers. In her article, Ms Braverman wrote that she believed the marches were not ""merely a cry for help for Gaza"", but an ""assertion of primacy by certain groups - particularly Islamists - of the kind we are more used to seeing in Northern Ireland"". A source close to the home secretary told the BBC the comment was a reference to the activities of ""dissident republicans"". Responding to the article, one Conservative Party source called the comparison with Northern Ireland ""wholly offensive and ignorant"". Ms Braverman also questioned why ""lockdown objectors were given no quarter by public order police yet Black Lives Matters demonstrators were enabled, allowed to break rules"". ""I have spoken to serving and former police officers who have noted this double standard,"" the home secretary wrote. Former cabinet minister Nadine Dorries claimed Ms Braverman was trying to get sacked to give her a platform of martyrdom in service of the right-wing. ""The competition is on now for who is going to be the leader of the opposition,"" Ms Dorries told the BBC.

When can protesting over the Gaza war be illegal in the UK?Published9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"On 7 October Hamas gunmen launched an attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing more than 1,200 people and taking more than 220 hostages. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes. Support and solidarity for both parties in the war is being expressed across the UK. Over the past two weekends, tens of thousands of people have attended pro-Palestinian marches in London. The BBC has been answering your questions about what your rights are when it comes to protesting and showing support. According to the government's website, individuals are allowed to fly a flag on private property as long as it meets standard conditions such as it being in a safe location and not obscuring roads or railways. It states thatany country's national flag does not need consent to be flown. However, any flag that makes reference to a proscribed organisation under the Terrorism Act cannot be flown legally. The UK government currently has a list of 79 proscribed international terrorist groups, which includes Hamas and Hezbollah. This means individuals are not allowed to fly a Hamas or Hezbollah flag on private property or in public. The BBC has been made aware of instances where police officers have warned people with a Palestinian flag on their private property that they could be in breach of the Public Order Act. Under the Act, someone can be found guilty of an offence if they have ""intent to cause a person harassment, alarm or distress"". Peter Walker, a human right's solicitor, explained to the BBC: ""There are no laws that ban any country's national flag to be hung on private property."" While the UK does not recognise Palestine as an independent state, Mr Walker said it was ""a partially recognised sovereign state amongst the international community"" as 138 of the UN's 193 member states recognise it. He added: ""If police are called to a property they have the right to make inquiries, but equally, unless they specify that you are committing an offence and will arrest you, you have the right to ignore them and close the door."" The Met Police said: ""Displaying a Palestinian flag on its own isn't a criminal offence, however it can be if there are aggravating factors."" When asked about the aggravating factors, the Met said these would be ""assessed on a case-by-case basis"". Generally speaking, your right to wave a flag is protected under the European Convention of Human Rights, which guarantees individuals' rights to freedom of expression. In a written reply to the BBC, Mr Walker said it would be ""extremely unlikely that waving a Palestinian (or Israeli) flag could ever be construed as intending to glorify acts of terrorism, but said the important thing to remember was context"". He added: ""Waving a flag or bearing a symbol in a deliberately offensive and provocative way could lead to an arrest. Whether it would hold up in court is probably a different matter."" Home Secretary Suella Braverman has written to chief constables in England and Wales to suggest that some instances of waving a Palestinian flag or chanting may be a criminal offence. She said: ""Behaviours that are legitimate in some circumstances, for example the waving of a Palestinian flag, may not be legitimate such as when intended to glorify acts of terrorism. ""Nor is it acceptable to drive through Jewish neighbourhoods, or single out Jewish members of the public, to aggressively chant or wave pro-Palestinian symbols at. ""Where harassment is identified, I would encourage the police to take swift and appropriate enforcement action."" The Met Police later published a statement saying ""the waving of a particular flag is not, in itself, a specific criminal offence unless it relates to a proscribed organisation"". Since protests began three weeks ago in London, 100 people have been arrested, according to the Met. On Saturday 28 October, five people at a central London pro-Palestinian demonstration of 70,000 were charged - two were accused of racially aggravated offences, another two of public order offences and another was charged with causing actual bodily harm. It is not clear if the public order offence charges related to waving a flag or chanting, but Mr Walker said he did not believe an ""arrest on that basis alone would ever hold up or result in a conviction"". During the protest, some people chanted ""from the river to the sea"", referring to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean. Ms Braverman had previously urged police chiefs to consider interpreting those words as an ""expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world"". The Palestinian Solidarity Campaign and other activists have contested this, saying the slogan refers to ""the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice"". Further chants, including ""chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map"" and chanting ""jihad"" have been identified by Ms Braverman as ones that police forces should take action on. It is important to remember that the police and Crown Prosecution Service are operationally independent from the government, meaning decisions on what might constitute law-breaking lie with them. Police are due to receive ""clarified"" guidance on hate crimesafter Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said officers' hands are tiedby laws on hate speech. He said his force was ""ruthless in tackling anybody who puts their foot over the legal line"", but argued hate crime laws ""probably need redrawing"" because extremists groups were able to spread ""truly toxic messages"" messages without breaking the law. The BBC recently reported thatPalestinian flags were being removed from lamp-postson streets in east London after concerns were raised with police. According to accounts on social media, nearly every lamp-post on Bow Road in Tower Hamlets had a flag attached. At the time the Met said no offence had been committed but Transport for London (TfL), which is responsible for the roads, said it was ""swiftly removing them"". The Met has alsoremoved posters of Israeli hostagesput up in Edgware, north London. Mr Walker said there was the ""potential"" of being arrested if you commit criminal damage which is defined as ""deliberate or reckless damage"" of property without lawful excuse. This could include putting flags, stickers or symbols on public property, but he said ""attaching a flag to a lamp-post is very unlikely to be considered criminal damage provided it does not damage the light post and can easily be removed"". He added, however, that ""police often do arrest protesters for criminal damage on fairly weak grounds, including for using chalk on pavement, for example"". Since 7 October, the Premier League has updated its guidance on flag flying at football matches. It says Israeli and Palestinian flags, displays, banners and scarves should not be displayed. Scottish football club Celtic has been fined by Uefa after a fan group defied the club's appeal and held aloft Palestinian flags before a Champions League match on 25 October. Tottenham Hotspur fans have also been told by the club not to bring Israeli flags to matches. Several supporters were spotted with the flag during a match against Fulham on 23 October. Guidance on whether fans flouting this rule will be removed from the stadium is still unclear. The BBC will continue to update the article to reflect new developments.

Iran-backed Yemeni rebels shoot down US dronePublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Yemen's Houthi rebels have shot down a US military drone, US officials and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement have said. A US official said an MQ9 drone was shot down off the Yemeni coast by Houthi forces. This was confirmed by a Houthi military spokesman. It comes as Washington is on alert for activity by Iran-backed groups in the Middle East as its close ally Israel - Iran's main adversary - battles Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Last month, a US navy warship intercepted cruise missiles and several drones launched by the Houthis from Yemen towards Israel. The US has moved military assets, including aircraft carriers, Marines and support ships, to the Middle East in the wake of regional tensions surrounding the Israel-Gaza war. This includes troops being stationed onboard military vessels in the Red Sea, which lies between Yemen and Israel. Yemen's Houthi rebels are backed by Iran, and have beenlocked in a prolonged civil war with Yemen's official government- supported by another Iran rival, Saudi Arabia - since 2014. The deputy leader of another Iran-backed group in the region, Lebanon's Hezbollah,told the BBC this weekthat Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza risks wider war in the Middle East. Sheikh Naim Qassem said that ""very serious and very dangerous developments could occur in the region, and no one would be able to stop the repercussions"". Meanwhile, the US also said on Wednesday that it had carried out strikes against a facility in eastern Syria that it said was used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups. A Pentagon official said the strikes, the second in recent weeks, were in response to attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria. ""While we are seeing an uptick in attacks, our purpose is to ensure that this conflict doesn't widen out beyond Israel,"" Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters regarding American deterrence efforts. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the strike killed nine people affiliated with Iran-backed groups in Syria, a figure that could not be independently confirmed.

"London Gaza rally: Commemoration, protest, freedom of speech - and yes, politicsPublished9 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","This week has the lot. And it's cranked up further, again, with yet another intervention from the home secretary, this time accusing the police of bias. It is quite the claim. And it is there in black and white in Suella Braverman'sarticle in The Times. ""Unfortunately, there is a perception that senior police officers play favourites when it comes to protesters,"" she writes. So did Downing Street sign off these words? A No 10 source wouldn't comment on ""internal processes"" when asked if they had seen the home secretary's article before it was published. Those around Mrs Braverman claimed Downing Street had seen the full text in advance. I note those two positions don't tessellate as neatly as they could. And the beginnings of what might become an almighty row within the Conservative Party are brewing. One senior figure told me: ""These latest comments are unhinged."" Another party source said her remarks on Northern Ireland were ""wholly offensive and ignorant"". In her article, Mrs Braverman writes: ""I do not believe that these marches are merely a cry for help for Gaza. They are an assertion of primacy by certain groups - particularly Islamists - of the kind we are more used to seeing in Northern Ireland. Also disturbingly reminiscent of Ulster are the reports that some of Saturday's march group organisers have links to terrorist groups, including Hamas."" For the last four Saturdays, parts of central London have been full of pro-Palestinian marchers. Another demonstration and march is planned this Saturday. But this Saturday is Armistice Day, and so a question: should a march go ahead on a day of commemoration? There is what politicians might say about this. There is what demonstrators might say about this. And there is what the law says about this. Let's look first at the law - and in particular,the Public Order Act 1986, section 13. It spells out that if the ""Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis"" or, to use more everyday language, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, concludes there is a risk of ""serious public disorder"" they can ask the home secretary to ban the march. (Incidentally, there is no mechanism to ban a static protest, as opposed to a moving one, a march). Crucially, in this case, the Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, says there isn't intelligence suggesting there will be serious public disorder, and so he believes he doesn't need to ask the home secretary to ban it. The prime minister said he thought the demonstration was ""disrespectful"". And yes, some found it despicable thata video appeared to show a man shouting ""jihad""at a separate event from one of the main marches last month. The Metropolitan Police say since the horrific attacks on Israel a month ago, it has made a total of 188 arrests involving ""hate crimes and acts such as violence"" linked to protests in the capital. Hundreds of thousands have protested. What is notable here is plenty of rows within and between public bodies happen every day - many out of public sight. But the prime minister and home secretary are actively choosing to publicise this one - and continue to lean into it. Rishi Sunak stressed it was the commissioner's decision and ""my job is to hold him accountable for that"". This involved Sir Mark being called into Downing Street. For his part, he had already said: ""Matters of taste and decency, whilst I understand them, aren't for us. The reason we have an independent police service is my concern and our concern is two things. It is the law. And the facts as they are today."" And those facts, he claims, don't point to serious public disorder. That could change, but it hasn't yet. Ben Jamal of the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, the march organisers, told me ""there was something askew with an argument that says a protest calling for a ceasefire is somehow inappropriate on Armistice Day"". He concludes the government has manufactured this row. The shadow home secretary, Labour's Yvette Cooper, claimed: ""Suella Braverman is out of control… No other Home Secretary of any party would ever do this."" But perhaps the most memorable conversation I've had about all this was with the Western Front Association. They are the organisers of the Armistice Day commemorations at the Cenotaph on Whitehall. In other words, the organisers of the very event the prime minister and home secretary are seeking to defend. And yet they were at pains to try to avoid being dragged into all this. After the meeting between the commissioner and the prime minister, Rishi Sunak confirmed that the march was going ahead. The route, as had been known for some time, isn't going very close to the Cenotaph. And it isn't starting until midday, in Hyde Park, an hour after the two-minute silence in Westminster. He added that ""there remains the risk of those who seek to divide society using this weekend as a platform to do so"", and - rather archly - described the Metropolitan Police's judgement as a ""posture"". There are highly political roles in public life that don't involve being a capital P politician. Being the Metropolitan Police commissioner is one of them. Sources at Scotland Yard said they wouldn't respond to the home secretary's remarks and their focus was on planning for events this weekend.",2023-11-09T03:16:45.000Z

Poppy seller: Police probing attack claim find 'insufficient evidence'Published8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Police have dropped investigations into an alleged attack on a 78-year-old poppy seller during a pro-Palestinian rally due to ""insufficient evidence"". Army veteran Jim Henderson said he was punched and kicked as he tried to pack up his stall at Waverley Station in Edinburgh on Saturday. British Transport Police said officers had reviewed CCTV footage and spoken to key witnesses. They said the investigation would not be taken any further. Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said the review of CCTV footage had been ""extensive"". He added: ""We have no reason to believe that poppy sellers are at any risk or being intentionally targeted."" Hundreds of people hadoccupied the station concourseto protest against the Israel-Gaza war. At the time Mr Hendersontold the Daily Mailhe was punched in the back as he bent down to collect his things. ""And then I got another punch in my side"" he said. The veteran told he paper he had served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles with the Royal Corps of Signals, 32 Signal Regiment. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators also occupied Glasgow Central station during a day of protests on Saturday. Marches have been taking place across the UK to urge an end to Israeli attacks in Gaza. The retaliatory strikes came after Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,400 people in Israel on 7 October. Since then the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,000 people have been killed there. BTP said officers had received a separate report of a racially aggravated public order offence at Edinburgh Waverley on Saturday. A 41-year-old man from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, has been arrested in connection with this incident - which BTP confirmed was not related to the Israel-Gaza conflict or any related protests.",2023-11-08T21:17:37.000Z

Appeal to help West Yorkshire cardiologist trapped in GazaPublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Colleagues of a doctor who works in West Yorkshire and was refused permission to leave Gaza have appealed for his safe return. Ahmed Sabra, a consultant cardiologist at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, was visiting relatives when the war with Israel began. However, at the Rafah border he was told he could not enter Egypt. Hospital colleagues said they want ""everything possible to be done"" to return him to the UK. Dr Sabra, who is also an NHS consultant in Swansea, had been waiting to leave Gaza for a month. However, his name was not on an approved list of foreign nationals allowed to leave, forcing him to be separated from his wife and three children, who escaped to Egypt. He told the BBC he is happy that his family are safe, but claimed the UK government had ""not done enough"" to help him and has pleaded with them to help him leave. ""I'm calling on the Foreign Office to do their duty for a British national, to evacuate me and get me out of Gaza,"" he said. A group of consultant cardiologists who work with Dr Sabra at Pinderfields have called for his return to the UK and described him as ""a valued member of our team, providing acute cardiac care for patients in West Yorkshire"". ""We are extremely concerned for his welfare,"" they said. The group from the Mid Yorkshire Teaching NHS Trust said: ""We have been in regular contact with him and it is clear he and his family have experienced unthinkable trauma and suffering, including losing family and friends. ""As he is a British national, we expected his safe passage across the border and we were thrilled to hear that he and his family had made it through the Rafah crossing into Egypt. ""To then find out he has been sent back to Gaza was devastating to his colleagues, friends and patients here."" Dr Sabra's colleagues said they believed the Foreign Office was aware of his plight. ""We have no political axe to grind, we just want everything possible to be done as quickly as possible to get our dear friend and colleague home safe,"" they said. Dr Sabra told the BBC: ""We are now being sent to a death sentence. ""We're seeing death every day, we smell death, the sound of death and we felt like we died one hundred times."" A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We're working round the clock to ensure all British nationals in Gaza who want to leave are able to. ""This involves submitting all details of British nationals and eligible dependants to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities. The authorities then review all cases and give permissions to cross. ""We remain in regular contact with British nationals in Gaza to provide them with the latest information, and UK teams are forward deployed to the border to receive anyone leaving"".

British nationals and dependents stopped from leaving Gaza with familiesPublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Two British nationals and dependants of two others have been prevented from leaving Gaza with their families to flee the war between Hamas and Israel. Abdalrahman Alharazin, an interpreter from London, said his pregnant wife and three children were able to cross into Egypt at Rafah as their names were on an approved list of foreign nationals. His name was not, though, and he waited almost three days at the Egyptian side. Ahmed Sabra, a doctor from Swansea, isstuck in the same situation. Like Mr Alharazin, he was separated from his wife and three children after officials on the Palestinian side of the border allowed him to accompany them to the Egyptian side. The two dependants, who have not been named, are the wives of British men who were allowed to cross into Egypt. One of the women is a doctor and the mother of two British children. ""I am really in shock, because I was in safety for 72 hours,"" Mr Alharazin told the BBC on Wednesday. ""I was expecting someone to help me and my kids, who are in tears, and my wife who needs a hospital. I thought someone would really look at us with mercy."" The UK government said it would not comment on specific cases, but that it was working round the clock to help. More than 150 of the estimated 200 British nationals who were in Gaza when the war began have been allowed to cross into Egypt since the Rafah crossing was reopened for foreign passport holders and seriously injured Palestinians a week ago. Israel has been bombarding Gaza for a month and launched a major ground offensive over a week ago in response to an attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 10,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while the UN warns that a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding. Mr Alharazin told the BBC that he had travelled to Gaza four months ago along with his wife and their three sons - Ibrahim, 10, Yousef, 7, and Mohammed, 6. They fled the Shejaiya area east of Gaza City on 13 October, after the Israeli military told the 1.1 million people in the north to flee southwards for their own safety. The family slept in a makeshift shelter at a UN-run school until 4 November, when the names of Mr Alharazin's wife and children appeared on a list of foreign passport holders who had been cleared to leave Gaza by Egyptian and Israeli authorities. They then moved to an area near the Egyptian border and waited until Monday, when crossings through Rafah resumed following a two-day suspension. Mr Alharazin said Palestinian officials allowed him to accompany his family to the arrivals hall on the Egyptian side of the crossing even though his name was not also on the approved list. ""The Palestinians told me: 'You should go with your wife and kids. And hopefully you will get across to Egypt.' ""We managed to get inside. But in Egypt, obviously, they said: 'Your name is not on the list. You have to wait here until the embassy puts you on the list.'"" ""So we waited for two-and-a-half days,"" he added. ""And this morning they told us: 'Sorry, your embassy didn't do what it's supposed to do. And we are sending you back to Gaza.'"" Mr Alharazin said he did not understand why the UK had allowed four families to be separated. Now, he has to find refuge again in what he described as ""the most dangerous area on Earth right now"". ""I am very fearful of my life,"" he said. ""This is an appeal to please get us out of here."" Dr Sabra told the BBC that he and his family had arrived in Gaza to visit relatives only three days before the war began, and that they had spent three weeks waiting near Rafah. He was similarly refused permission to enter Egypt with his wife and three children after being allowed through the crossing by Palestinian officials. ""[We] arrived on the Egyptian side and we just let out a big sigh of relief. We thought we [had] made it to safety, only to be told: 'No, your father has to go back.'"" He added: ""We were waiting on the Egyptian side of the border for the British embassy [in Cairo] to do their job, but unfortunately this did not materialise."" Dr Sabra said being forced to return to Gaza was like being given a ""death sentence"" and accused the UK of not doing enough to protect its citizens. ""Just because I am of Palestinian origin, I am not as equal as any other human. I didn't want to say this, but this is the reality. It is a disgrace,"" he complained. Dr Sabra and Mr Alharazin said their families had both finally found safety in Cairo. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was ""working round the clock to ensure all British nationals in Gaza who want to leave are able to"". ""This involves submitting all details of British nationals and eligible dependants to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities. The authorities then review all cases and give permissions to cross."" ""We remain in regular contact with British nationals in Gaza to provide them with the latest information, and UK teams are forward deployed to the border to receive anyone leaving.""",2023-11-08T21:08:17.000Z

Star of David graffiti in Paris - the Russian connectionPublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"French police believe a graffiti campaign featuring Star of David stencils may have been the work of Russian intelligence. In the last 10 days around 250 blue Stars of David - similar to the one on the Israeli flag - have appeared on buildings in Paris and its suburbs. They prompted an outcry from French politicians,who presumed the signs were antisemitic. But from the start investigators were more circumspect. While politicians made comparisons with Nazi-era graffiti to ""out"" Jews in their homes, investigators pointed out the Stars of David were randomly distributed, with no obvious Jewish connection in the choice of buildings. Also the message in the medium was confusing. Conceivably a blue Israeli flag, or what immediately evokes it, could be seen as a pro-Jewish sign. Surely any genuine antisemite would have found a clearer way of expressing their hate. Having caught and questioned two Moldovan nationals in connection with the first wave of stencils, French police and intelligence services now suspect the operation may be a classic piece of Russiandezinformatsiya(disinformation). According to a statement from the prosecutor's office on Wednesday, the graffiti was put up on the two nights in late October by two separate couples. From telephone tracking, they believe both couples were taking orders from the same person. ""At this stage it is not excluded that the [graffiti] was carried out under the express orders of a person living abroad,"" the prosecutor's office said. French media outlets that have had access to the investigation go further. They point to a pro-Russian businessman from Moldova. According to Le Monde newspaper, the graffiti operation is linked to a longstanding Russian propaganda network known as Doppelgänger. In June Le Monde wrote a series of articles about Doppelgänger, which it said used computer bots to deluge social media with fake news postings. At the time the main purpose was to undermine faith in Western policy on Ukraine. According to Le Monde, both couples who stencilled the Star of David graffiti were accompanied by a photographer whose job was to put the images straightaway online. The newspaper says the images first appeared only on accounts linked to the Doppelgänger network. French police say the first couple - who were arrested - claimed to have been on holiday in Paris when they were approached by a man who heard them speak Russian and offered them a small sum of money to put up the tags. That couple is currently awaiting deportation. The second couple left the country before they could be detained. The photographer or photographers remain unidentified. Quoting sources in the investigation, Le Monde said the cut-price modus operandi - using poorly-paid proxy freelancers - was typical of today's Russian intelligence, which was hit hard by the expulsion of spies from Western capitals after the outbreak of the Ukraine war. As for the purpose of Operation Star of David, like all dezinformatsiya it seems to have been to sow confusion and anxiety. The fact that the symbol could be either pro- or anti-Israeli made it all the more interesting: that way both sides would be suspicious.",2023-11-08T17:05:48.000Z

Imran Hussain: Shadow minister quits Labour front bench over GazaPublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Labour MP Imran Hussain has quit Sir Keir Starmer's shadow ministerial team over his desire to ""strongly advocate for a ceasefire"" in Gaza. Mr Hussain was the shadow minister for the New Deal for Working People. He said he remained committed to Labour's agenda but that his view on Gaza differed ""substantially"" from the position Sir Keir has adopted. A Labour spokesperson said a humanitarian pause was the most realistic way to address the crisis. Sir Keir has argued that a ceasefire would allow Hamas to carry out future attacks, and the ""only credible approach"" was to call for a humanitarian pause that would allow aid into Gaza. Speaking to the BBC, Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson backed her leader's position, arguing a ceasefire ""would freeze the conflict in time"". She said a ceasefire ""risks allowing Hamas to regroup and to perpetuate further terrible atrocities that they have said they want the opportunity to do"". Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said a ""majority"" of the Labour party now supported a ceasefire. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One, Mr McDonnell called on Sir Keir to ""show leadership"" by pressing for a ceasefire. In a resignation posted onsocial media, Mr Hussain said he wanted to be a ""strong advocate"" for a ceasefire alongside the UN and multiple charities, calling it ""essential to ending the bloodshed"". ""It is clear that I cannot sufficiently, in all good conscience, do this from the frontbench given its current position,"" he said. He said he had ""unequivocally condemned"" Hamas's attack on 7 October and believed that ""every country has the right to defend itself"", but that that should ""never become a right to deliberately violate international law on protecting civilians or to commit war crimes"". ""It has always been my view, which I've made clear repeatedly in Parliament, that human rights are universal and that it is our duty to call out all those who violate international law,"" he said. He went on to describe the situation in Gaza as ""beyond that of a humanitarian catastrophe"" and said a ceasefire would help both the passage of aid into the territory and the safe return of Israeli hostages. He also said he was ""deeply troubled"" by an LBC interview Sir Keir gave on 11 October about Israel's actions in Gaza and that, while he appreciated Sir Keir's later clarification of the comments, he believed the party ""needs to go further and call for a ceasefire"". In the interview, Sir Keir was asked whether it was ""appropriate"" for Israel to cut off the supply of power and water to Gaza. ""I think that Israel does have that right,"" he said. ""Obviously everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself."" A spokesman for the Labour leader later said he had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence. A number of senior Labour figures, including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, and Scottish leader Anas Sarwar, as well as more than 60 MPs and 250 councillors, have now backed calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Mr Khan said a ceasefire would ""allow the international community more time to prevent a protracted conflict in the region and further devastating loss of life"", while Mr Burnham said it was ""vital that urgent support and humanitarian aid is allowed into the area"". But Labour's position is that a ceasefire would ""only freeze this conflict and would leave hostages in Gaza and Hamas with the infrastructure and capability to carry out the sort of attack we saw on 7 October,"" a spokesperson said. ""Labour is calling for humanitarian pauses in the fighting. This is the best and most realistic way to address the humanitarian emergency in Gaza and is a position shared by our major allies,"" the spokesperson said. On Wednesday, the government resisted calls from MPs to advocate for a ceasefire during a debate in the House of Commons. Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said the government ""unequivocally supports Israel's right to defend itself"", but was adding pressure to ensure the campaign minimised civilian casualties. Mr Hussain was elected to represent the Bradford East constituency in 2015 and had been shadow minister for the New Deal for Working People since September. He has previously served as shadow minister for work, shadow minister for justice, and shadow minister for international development.

US warns Israel against reoccupying Gaza after warPublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that Israel cannot reoccupy Gaza after the war with Hamas ends. Mr Blinken also insisted Hamas could not continue to rule there as it risked a repetition of the 7 October attacks. He said there should be no forced displacement, blockade or reduction of territory, and that the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority should govern. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israelwill have ""overall security responsibility"" for Gaza indefinitely. He did not elaborate on what that would entail when he made the comment in an TV interview on Monday, but a senior Israeli official told reporters in Washington on Tuesday that Israel had no intention of reoccupying Gaza or controlling it for ""a long time"". Israel has been bombarding the territory for a month and began a major ground offensive over a week ago with the objective of destroying Hamas, which it, the US and other Western powers consider a terrorist organisation. The war began after an unprecedented cross-border assault on southern Israel by Hamas on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 10,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while the UN is warning that an ""unfolding catastrophe"" is making a humanitarian ceasefire more urgent. At a meeting in Tokyo, foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy nations declared that they supported ""humanitarian pauses and corridors to facilitate urgently needed assistance, civilian movement and the release of hostages"". But they stopped short of calling for a ceasefire. At a news conference afterwards, Mr Blinken set out the Biden administration's position on what a post-conflict Gaza should look like. ""The United States believes key elements should include no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. Not now. Not after the war,"" he said. ""No use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism or other violent attacks. No reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends. No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza. No reduction in the territory of Gaza."" ""We must also ensure no terrorist threats can emanate from the West Bank."" The secretary of state said ""affirmative elements"" were necessary for a ""sustained peace"". ""It must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority,"" he said. ""And it must include a sustained mechanism for reconstruction in Gaza, and a pathway to Israelis and Palestinians living side-by-side in states of their own, with equal measures of security, freedom, opportunity and dignity."" When asked about the Israeli prime minister's comments, he said there would need to be a ""transition period at the end of the conflict"" but that he did not believe Israel intended to reoccupy and govern Gaza. Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war. Although it withdrew its forces and settlers from Gaza in 2005, the UN still considers the territory occupied because Israel retains control over its air space, coastal waters and shared border. On Tuesday, Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer clarified to the BBC what Mr Netanyahu had meant by ""security responsibility"". ""Governance requires an administration we assume will be Palestinian,"" he said. ""There's a question of the overriding security responsibility, that's what he was talking about, to ensure that in a post-Hamas Gaza we don't have the re-emergence of a terror threat from in Gaza."" ""Israel wasn't operating or doing any operations in Gaza, and we saw what happened over nearly two decades,"" he added. ""They built this terror state right on the south of Israel and we saw the effects of this."" He also doubted whether the Palestinian Authority - which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under full Israeli control and is dominated by the Fatah movement, Hamas's rival - was the right body to govern Gaza. ""They haven't shown their ability there to actively fight terrorism,"" he added. Mustafa Barghouti, head of the Palestinian National Initiative, was sceptical about what Mr Netanyahu was saying in public. ""When he says that he wants to keep the security control of Gaza forever that means he's planning to annex Gaza to Israel,"" he told the BBC. Mr Barghouti said Palestinians needed a unified leadership that ""could prepare the ground for free democratic elections and end the occupation, not only of Gaza Strip but also of the West Bank and East Jerusalem"". On the ground on Wednesday, the UN said thousands more people had fled northern areas as Israeli troops battled Hamas fighters deep inside Gaza City. For a second day, crowds were seen walking southwards along Salah al-Din Road during a window announced by the Israeli military. Many said they had run out of food and water or were frightened by news of Israeli forces' advances, while UN monitors reported that some had to cross Israeli checkpoints, where they saw people arrested. Israel's military is focusing its operations on Gaza City, where it claims Hamas has its central command and a vast network of tunnels. Hundreds of thousands of people have now heeded Israeli orders to move to the south since the war began, although in recent days Israel has continued to strike what it says are Hamas targets there and civilians have been killed.",2023-11-08T16:23:29.000Z

UK doctor sent back to Gaza after escape to Egypt is refusedPublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A doctor from Swansea has been forced back into Gaza after being refused permission to escape to Egypt. Ahmed Sabra's name was not on an approved list of foreign nationals allowed to leave the Gaza strip, forcing him to be separated from his wife and three children who did escape. Dr Sabra told the BBC he has been sent to a ""death sentence"" and accused the UK government of failing to help. The Foreign Office said it was in regular contact with British nationals. Dr Sabra and his family were visiting relatives when the war with Israel began, and had been waiting to leave Gaza for a month. He said staff on the Palestinian side of the border had allowed him to remain with his family while they made their journey towards Egypt. He and his family spent two days at the Rafah border waiting for his name to be processed, only to be told he did not have permission to enter Egypt. Dr Sabra is currently on the Palestinian side of the Rafah border while his family are in Cairo. He told the BBC he is happy that his family are safe, he has claimed the UK government has ""not done enough"" to help him and is pleading with them to help him escape. ""I'm calling on the Foreign Office to do their duty for a British national. To evacuate me and get me out of Gaza,"" he said. ""We are now being sent to a death sentence. ""We've been sent to the most dangerous place in world and I don't think the UK government did anything to help us. ""We've been told that there is a clear process to follow and the British Embassy did not follow the process."" Dr Sabra described the last four weeks of the war as a ""very distressing experience"". ""We're seeing death every day, we smell death, the sound of death and we felt like we died one hundred times,"" he said. Geraint Davies, independent MP for Swansea West, said Dr Sabra's failure to be allowed to leave Gaza was a ""grotesque failure"" by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office [FCDO] which had put him in ""mortal danger"". ""Dr Sabra is my constituent, and a Swansea NHS consultant has been allowed by the UK government to be removed from Egyptian soil and returned to Gaza after getting across the Rafah border whilst his wife and three children have been sent without him to Cairo. ""This is more than a grotesque failure by the FCDO who are directly complicit according to the Egyptians in him being sent back to mortal danger. ""I have been in touch with No 10 which, alongside James Cleverly and Lord Ahmad who I am in touch with directly, must be held responsible for allowing this to happen. ""Much more was done for non UK nationals escaping from enemies in Kabul than for Dr Sabra who was already in the British Embassy's care and has now been returned to face the risk of sudden death in Gaza."" A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We're working round the clock to ensure all British nationals in Gaza who want to leave are able to. This involves submitting all details of British nationals and eligible dependants to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities. The authorities then review all cases and give permissions to cross. ""We remain in regular contact with British nationals in Gaza to provide them with the latest information, and UK teams are forward deployed to the border to receive anyone leaving"". Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October when Hamas attacks saw 1,400 people killed and more than 200 taken hostage. More than 10,500 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.",2023-11-08T15:07:48.000Z

Hezbollah warns of regional war if Gaza bombing goes onPublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The second in command of Hezbollah - the powerful Iranian backed militia in Lebanon - has said Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza risks wider war in the Middle East. Sheikh Naim Qassem told the BBC that ""very serious and very dangerous developments could occur in the region, and no-one would be able to stop the repercussions"". Hezbollah's deputy leader was speaking in an interview in Beirut, as the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 10,000 people had been killed there. Israel's assault follows the Hamas attacks on 7 October which killed 1,400 people - 1,000 of them civilians. ""The danger is real,"" he said, ""because Israel is increasing its aggression against civilians and killing more women and children. Is it possible for this to continue and increase, without bringing real danger to the region? I think not."" He insisted any escalation would be linked to Israel's actions. ""Every possibility has a response,"" he said. Hezbollah, ""the Party of God"" has plenty of possibilities. The Shia Islamist group - classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and the Arab League - is the largest political and military force in Lebanon. So far its response to the war in Gaza has involved amplifying its warnings, but carefully calibrating its actions. When an Israeli strike killed a woman and three children in southern Lebanon on Sunday, Hezbollah used Grad rockets for the first time in the conflict, killing an Israeli civilian. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has threatened that every civilian death in Lebanon will reap another across the border. But notably, he has not threatened Israel with all-out war While insisting that ""all options are on the table"" the militant group has confined itself to cross-border attacks, hitting mainly military targets. More than 60 of its fighters have been killed, but it has plenty more battle-hardened supporters to replace them. One fighter buried in Beirut this week was the fifth member of his family to die for Hezbollah, going back generations. Throughout our interview the organisation's deputy leader tried to portray Hezbollah as a defensive organisation - though it is committed to Israel's destruction and sparked a war with Israel in 2006 by abducting two of its soldiers in a cross-border raid. Sheikh Qassem claimed Israel ""initiated the aggression against Gaza in a hideous way"". When the BBC pointed out that it was Hamas that had attacked Israel on 7 October, he defended the attacks as an inevitable response to Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands. He repeated the unfounded claim that Israeli forces, not Hamas, killed many Israeli civilians. But what of the helmet cameras - worn by the Hamas militants themselves - showing them on a killing spree? He parried the question. ""Why don't we look at what Israel has done inside Gaza,"" he said. ""They kill civilians and demolish homes."" He called the Hamas attacks ""a great result for the Palestinian resistance"" and denied they had backfired. What about the 10,000 Gazans who have been killed since then? ""The massacres committed by Israel are mobilising the Palestinians more and more to cling to their land,"" he replied. He conceded that Iran ""supports and finances"" Hezbollah but claimed it did not give the orders. But experts say it is Tehran that calls the shots and will decide whether or not to engage in all-out war. And if Israeli forces have to wage war on a second front with Hezbollah, they will be facing an enemy with more arms than most countries. The militant group puts Hamas in the shade, with an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles. It has up to 60,000 fighters, including special forces, regular fighters, and reserves, according to Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based defence and security consultant, who has studied Hezbollah for decades. Back in 2006 the group fought Israel to a standstill, but Lebanon had a lot more dead. More than 1,000 of its people were killed, most of them civilians, and whole neighbourhoods were flattened in Hezbollah strongholds. Israel lost 121 soldiers and 44 civilians. Lebanon has careened from crisis to crisis since then - with the devastating explosion in Beirut port in 2020, the collapse of the economy, and the disintegration of the political system. Small wonder few here have an appetite for war. Many worry that Hezbollah's cross-border attacks could drag this country into a war it cannot afford. Sheikh Qassem is unapologetic. ""It's the right of any Lebanese to be afraid of war,"" he said. ""That's normal. Nobody likes war. Tell the Israeli entity to stop the aggression, so the battles do not expand."" There could be many shades of escalation ahead - short of all-out war between Hezbollah and Israel. But if it comes it will bring devastation all round, says Blanford. ""It's going to make what's happening in Gaza look like a walk in the park,"" he told the BBC. ""Israel will be in lockdown for the duration of the conflict. Most of its population will have to remain in bomb shelters,"" he said. ""There would be no civil aviation or maritime traffic. Hezbollah's larger guided missiles could hit military targets across the country."" As for Lebanon, he said Israel would reduce it to ""a car park"". For now, Hezbollah, Israel, and Iran are all holding back, old enemies assessing new realities. That doesn't mean all-out war won't happen - by miscalculation if not by design. This is a dangerous new chapter in a blood-soaked region. After 7 October, the only certainties appear to be more anguish, death, and destruction.",2023-11-08T12:52:43.000Z

Gaza: Welsh Parliament to debate call for ceasefirePublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Politicians in the Senedd will debate calls for an ""immediate ceasefire"" in the Middle East later. Plaid Cymru has tabled a motion condemning the attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians, and the Israeli government's ""indiscriminate attacks on Gaza"". But opinion in the Welsh Parliament - and its Labour group - is divided on what the Senedd should say. Ministers will give Labour backbenchers a free vote and will abstain. That includes First Minister Mark Drakeford, who has expressed a similar position to Sir Keir Starmer and hascalled for an humanitarian pause. It is possible that Wednesday's motion will pass with the backing of several LabourMembers of the Senedd(MS) who have alreadysigned a separate symbolic statement of opinion, which had been backed by a few Conservatives, calling for an ""immediate ceasefire"". But the result is not clear and two Labour MSs have supported an alternative Welsh Conservative amendment that instead calls for a ""suspension of hostilities"". A large group of Labour MSs supporting calls for a ceasefire could put more pressure on UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who has been facing calls to change his stancefrom within his own party. Under Wales' system of devolution the Senedd has no formal role in foreign affairs but politicians in Cardiff Bay often express their views on international matters. Prime MinisterRishi Sunak has also backed calls for a humanitarian pause. The Urdd youth organisation, Muslim Council of Wales, Wales TUC and Cymdeithas yr Iaith Welsh language society have also joined the calls for a ceasefire. The Plaid Cymru motion on Wednesday calls ""on the international community to unite in seeking an immediate ceasefire to end the human suffering and allow humanitarian organisations to reach those in need"". Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Palestinian and Israeli families have been torn apart. Hamas must release all hostages immediately and the Israeli government must stop its intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip."" Labour MSs John Griffiths, who tabled the statement of opinion, Sarah Murphy and Carolyn Thomas are expected to back the Plaid motion. An amendment put forward by the Welsh Conservative MS Darren Millar, and supported by Labour backbenchers Alun Davies and Hefin David, instead calls for a ""suspension of hostilities to allow for the establishment of humanitarian corridors"". It regrets the loss of civilian life ""in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank"", and ""recognises the right of all sovereign states, including the State of Israel, to defend themselves and their citizens"". The text - expected to be backed by the Conservative group - also calls for the ""international community to work with Israeli and Palestinian representatives to bring an end to the conflict and negotiate a permanent peace settlement"". Alun Davies, Labour MS for Blaenau Gwent, accused Plaid Cymru's motion of creating ""an equivalence between Hamas and Israel and that is just not true and therefore not possible for me to support"". ""There is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas,"" he toldBBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme. He said he was disappointed that the government was abstaining on the debate. Mr Millar said it was important that the Senedd sends a clear message ""that we want to see a long and lasting peace settlement for the good of both the Israeli and Palestinian people"". Mr Drakeford is not expected to contribute to the debate, with Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt responding for the government.",2023-11-08T11:58:17.000Z

Police warn of UK attack risk as anti-terror hotline calls surgePublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Counter-terrorism police are warning there could be an increased risk of attacks in the UK because of the Israel-Gaza conflict. Reports to the anti-terror hotline between 7-25 October doubled compared to the same period last year. The number of reports containing information classed as significant also rose by nearly four times. UK police say the Israel-Gaza conflict could have an ""energising effect"" on those considering attacks. On 7 October, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 200 people hostage. Since then, Israel has been bombing Gaza, with more than 10,000 people killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Counter-terrorism police data shows the hotline received 1,350 reports between 7-25 October compared to 620 in the same period the year before. The number of reports containing information classed as significant rose from 50 to 200. What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now? Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor of Counter Terrorism Policing says they have seen an increase in tensions within some communities in the UK. ""That can have an energising effect on people who may be considering, or even planning, to commit violent acts on UK soil,"" he said. ""We know from experience in the past that events across the globe, and in the Middle East, can have a direct impact on events in the UK. ""It could be the thing that tips them into actually going ahead and committing those atrocities."" The last series of significant attacks in the UK were in 2017, when the Manchester Arena bombing and the attacks on Westminster Bridge and London Bridge occurred in the aftermath of the Islamic State group declaring a caliphate in Syria and Iraq. The 7/7 bombings on London's transport network in 2005, in which 52 people died, took place in the aftermath of the Iraq War. At present, the UK's terror threat level remains ""substantial"" - the third highest out of three levels - meaning an attack is ""likely"". It has not been increased to the next level, ""severe"", since the Israel-Gaza conflict began. The UK threat level is assessed and set by UK security services. ""We know that the current conflict is a hugely emotive issue for hundreds of people across the UK, not just within Jewish and Muslim communities,"" said Mr Taylor. ""It's really important that we listen to them."" As part of their winter campaign, police are asking communities to continue to stay alert and report anything that ""doesn't feel right"". ""We want people to enjoy the winter period. We are working incredibly hard to make sure you can enjoy this time of year safely.""",2023-11-08T11:10:05.000Z

Rashida Tlaib censured over Israel-Gaza commentsPublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The US Congress has voted to censure its only Palestinian-American member over comments she made on the Israel-Gaza war. Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib was rebuked for her defence of the chant ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"". The resolution formally condemned her for ""calling for the destruction of the state of Israel"". The measure passed by 234 to 188 votes. Twenty-two Democrats voted to censure. Ms Tlaibposted a videoto Twitter on Friday that included a clip of protestors using the chant, which critics say calls for Palestinian control of all land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, including Israel. The video also accused President Joe Biden of supporting genocide in Gaza and called for a ceasefire. The Anti-Defamation Leagueand Jewish groups say the slogan, used at protests around the world, is a call for the destruction of Israel. Pro-Palestinian activists argue that most people using it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the elimination of Israel itself. Ms Tlaib later defended her use of the slogan, calling it ""an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate."" The comment stirred up cross-party condemnation and criticism from allies in her own state, prompting two separate measures seeking to censure her. Republican Representative Rich McCormick, who represents Georgia, introduced a resolution on Monday, accusing Ms Tlaib of ""calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and dangerously promoting false narratives"" about Hamas's attack on Israel. Twenty-two Democrats joined the vast majority of Republicans voting for Ms Tlaib's censure. After the vote, Ms Tlaib told the house that her comments were directed at the Israeli government. ""I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable. We are human beings, just like anyone else,"" she said. More than 1,400 Israelis were killed in the 7 October attack by Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 10,300 Palestinians have since been killed in Israeli attacks. The Biden administration has dismissed calls for a ceasefire in favour of a humanitarian pause to allow aid, food and water into Gaza.",2023-11-08T10:19:15.000Z

Israel-Gaza: Malaysia will maintain ties with Hamas says PM Anwar IbrahimPublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Malaysia's leader Anwar Ibrahim has said his nation will maintain ties with Hamas and will ""not punish"" the group. Malaysians should ""unanimously back"" the Palestinian cause, the prime minister told parliament on Tuesday. Mr Anwar was responding to a proposal by US lawmakers to sanction Hamas's foreign supporters. Analysts say this is also politically expedient in a country where support for Palestinians has long been bipartisan as well as widespread. An opposition lawmaker had asked Mr Anwar about the Malaysian government's stand after the US House of Representatives last week voted to sanction foreign supporters of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. ""I will not accept any threats, including this... This action is unilateral and not valid, because we as members of the United Nations only recognise decisions made by the UN Security Council,"" Mr Anwar said. Malaysia, a Muslim-majority nation, has long advocated for the Palestinian cause. It does not recognise Israel diplomatically and has maintained that no such recognition will be given until a two-state solution - one for the Israelis and one for the Palestinians - is realised. Its capital, Kuala Lumpur, is a frequent host to conferences on Palestinian issues. The 76-year-old Mr Anwar has also advocated for Palestinians since his university days. Like in many parts of the world, Israel's retaliatory strikes on Gaza have sparked mass gatherings and prayer rallies in Malaysia. But it has also led to some displays of support for Hamas.A video of a group of teachers dressed up as militants and toting toy rifleswent viral on TikTok during Malaysia's Palestine Solidarity Week at the end of October, prompting Mr Anwar to call on schools to monitor activities during the week. Mr Anwar's mentor-turned-political rival Mahathir Mohamad, has also made strong remarks in support of the Palestinian cause, calling out other nations for their silence over what he has called ""Israeli war crimes"". Mr Anwar thereforecannot afford to be seen as having weak viewsat a time when religious conservatism is rising in Malaysia, Julia Lau and Francis Hutchinson, researchers at the Singapore-based think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, wrote recently. The prime minister is also facing decreasing support from the Malay-Muslim community at home. A recent poll by Malaysian think tank Ilham Centre found he only had a 24% approval rating among ethnic Malays. In contrast, he enjoyed 88% ethnic Chinese support and 81% backing from the ethnic Indian community. Mr Anwar had been criticised before for not taking a stronger stance against Israel. In a 2012 interview, he said Malaysia should ""protect the security [of Israel] but be as firm in protecting the legitimate interests of the Palestinians"". He later said these remarks were consistent with the two-state solution. But Mr Anwar appears to be taking a tougher stance in response to the ongoing Israel-Gaza war. He has rejected Western pressure to condemn Hamas, noting that the group had been elected by Gazans to govern the enclave. At a pro-Palestinian rally last month, he condemned Israeli military action in the Gaza Strip as ""the height of barbarism in this world"". On Tuesday, Mr Anwar urged media outlets not to describe Hamas fighters as ""militants"", comparing the group with the African National Congress (ANC), which sought to end apartheid in South Africa. The ANC and Nelson Mandela, who served as its president from 1991 to 1997, were ""accused of terrorism"" by the West but Malaysian authorities had continued to support them, Mr Anwar said. ""There must be awareness in Malaysia, where the media must understand the concerns and sensitivities of the people, as well as recognise the Palestinians' rights over their dispossession of land, wealth, and dignity, which continued to be abused,"" he said. More than 10,300 people have been killed in Gaza according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 4,100 children. The Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, while more than 200 people were taken hostage.",2023-11-08T07:32:14.000Z

Hamas hostages: Israeli mothers recall their children being kidnapped by HamasPublished8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Renana Jacob was not at home when Hamas's deadly attack on 7 October reached her kibbutz in southern Israel, but she quickly managed to reach her two sons by phone. ""The boys told me that they heard gunshots outside, and I started reassuring them that it was the army coming to save them,"" she said of Yagel, 12, and Or, 16. It was not Israeli soldiers outside the home, however, but Hamas gunmen, who killed 1,400 people, mainly civilians, and took more than 200 people hostage in those attacks. A few hours into the attacks, Ms Jacob said Yagel whispered down the phone to her that people had broken into the house. ""They were terrified,"" she said. ""The last thing I heard my youngest boy saying to me a month ago… he was begging for them not to take him. He said 'I'm too young. Please don't take me. I'm too young'. ""But they took him."" She has not heard from her two children since. Yagel and Or are believed to be among the 242 people the Israeli military said Hamas is holding hostage in the Gaza Strip. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is ""gravely concerned"" about their conditions - especially those who are children, elderly or in poor health - and has called for their immediate release. Ms Jacob was speaking to the BBC's The Context, in an emotional interview alongside two other Israeli mothers - Batsheva Yahalomi and Hadas Kalderon - whose children have also been kidnapped by Hamas. The trio travelled from Israel to the UK to raise awareness about the issue, conducting media interviews and meeting with the Qatari ambassador to the UK. The Gulf state is acting as a mediator between Israel and Hamas - proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK - to try and free the hostages. Ms Jacob said the ambassador has ""given us the impression that Qatar is doing whatever they can to help, and I do believe him"". Ms Yahalomi also underwent a terrifying ordeal when gunmen entered her family's home on 7 October. She managed to escape with her two daughters - including a baby - after Israeli soldiers intercepted their would-be kidnappers near the Gaza border. Her husband Ohad - who she said was shot by Hamas ""terrorists"" - and her 12-year-old son, Eitan, were taken into Gaza on motorbikes, and she has not heard from them since. ""This was the last time I saw my son… [I've] not had any contact, any news from him,"" she said. Ms Kalderon had five members of her family - including her two children Erez, 12, and Sahar, 16, as well as their father, Ofer - taken hostage. Her elderly mother and niece were killed by Hamas. ""I don't even have time to grieve. I didn't even go to the funeral because I have to fight for those that are still alive,"" she said, adding that the release of hostages must be the ""main priority"". ""We know nothing about them. They've been held in tunnels, deep underground. They can't see the sky, and the sun, and I'm sure they're terrified,"" she said. Ms Jacob said 32 children are being held by Hamas, and called for their immediate release. Israel has been launching near-constant air strikes on the Gaza Strip since the 7 October attacks. The Hamas-run health ministry there says more than 10,300 people have been killed, including more than 4,100 children. Some politicians have questioned the accuracy of those figures, but the WHO says it believes them to be reliable. Ms Jacob called for a ""pause"" to ensure that children in Gaza can also make it out safely. ""There's so much violence going on. But my heart goes out to every child and every mother who becomes a victim of this."" So let us just pause and have a children's time-out - get our children out and get the Gaza children out,"" she said. As well as international criticism for the bombing campaign his government is overseeing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also faced anger at home, notably about the security failure that allowed Hamas to breach the border wall and kill thousands, as well as the lack of progress on freeing hostages. So far just five hostages are known to have been freed. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Mr Netanyahu, also appeared on The Context and acknowledged a ""terrible failure"" in the security response ahead of Hamas' attacks. He was also asked about an apparent lack of communication with the families of those held hostage and said a ""special directorate"" has been established. ""We can only feel their pain and their suffering, and we're making a maximum effort to get out their loved ones,"" he said. For their part, Ms Jacob, Ms Yahalomi and Ms Kalderon are focusing their energy on ensuring their loved ones are released as soon as possible. ""They disappeared from our life. We don't know when we're going to see them again,"" Ms Kalderon said.",2023-11-08T06:42:57.000Z

'I’m calling from Israeli intelligence. We have the order to bomb. You have two hours'Published8 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The call to Mahmoud Shaheen came at dawn. It was Thursday 19 October at about 06:30, and Israel had been bombing Gaza for 12 days straight. He'd been in his third-floor, three-bedroom flat in al-Zahra, a middle-class area in the north of the Gaza Strip. Until now, it had been largely untouched by air strikes. He'd heard a rising clamour outside. People were screaming. ""You need to escape,"" somebody in the street shouted, ""because they will bomb the towers"". As he left his building and crossed the road, looking for a safe place, his phone lit up. It was a call from a private number. ""I'm speaking with you from Israeli intelligence,"" a man said down the line, according to Mahmoud. That call would last more than an hour - and it would be the most terrifying call of his life. The voice addressed Mahmoud by his full name and spoke in flawless Arabic. ""He told me he wanted to bomb three towers… and ordered me to evacuate the surrounding area."" Mahmoud's tower was not directly under threat - but he was suddenly responsible for evacuating hundreds of people. ""I had the lives of people in my hands,"" he says. He gathered his thoughts and told the man, who identified himself as Abu Khaled, not to hang up the phone. As a 40-year-old dentist, Mahmoud says he has no idea why he was chosen for this task. But that day, he did everything he could to keep his community safe. Directed by the voices of strangers, who always seemed to know how to reach him even when his battery ran out, he pleaded for the bombing to stop and screamed until his throat hurt for people to run away. He led a mass evacuation of his neighbours - and then watched his neighbourhood explode in front of his eyes. During this conflict, the Israeli military has phoned Gazans sometimes to warn them ahead of air strikes - Mahmoud's account gives an insight into one such phone call in an unprecedented level of detail. The BBC contacted Mahmoud after multiple al-Zahra residents identified him as the man who received the warning call. We cannot independently verify the contents of the call, which he recounted roughly three weeks after the event. The details, however, match those on a community Facebook group from the day as well as satellite images before and after the bombing. We know that day many hundreds of people were left homeless as the Israeli army bombed at least 25 residential blocks housing hundreds of apartments, destroying an entire neighbourhood. These people were forced to flee with what few belongings they could take, and were eventually dispersed across Gaza. The IDF says it strikes military targets and these actions are subject to the ""relevant provisions of international law"". Mahmoud could not believe it when the man began speaking, he recalls. People around him warned that the call may be fake. Since the war had begun, messages had been circulating in the community Facebook group warning of hoax calls and offering tips on identifying real Israeli evacuation orders. Mahmoud asked the voice on the phone to fire a warning shot to prove this was real. If those still sleeping did not hear the screams from the streets then they would hear the shot, he thought. A warning shot seemingly from nowhere, but perhaps from a drone, hit one of the apartment blocks under threat, he says. ""I asked him to 'shoot another warning shot before you bomb',"" Mahmoud says. One more rang out. Now that Mahmoud knew it was real he tried to stall, asking the man to be patient. ""I told him: 'Don't betray us and bomb while people are still evacuating.'"" The man said he would give Mahmoud time - he said he did not want anyone to die, the dentist recalls. Mahmoud responded that he didn't want anyone to even be injured. He kept the call going as he rushed around the neighbourhood, urging people to evacuate. One neighbour remembers the dentist ""just shouting"", then others joined in. ""I didn't want to know that there's someone I could have saved and I didn't,"" Mahmoud says. Hundreds of people poured into the streets that morning. Residents of this usually peaceful city were screaming and running, some of them wearing their pyjamas or prayer clothes. The area - just north of the Wadi Gaza river, a point that Israel has been ordering civilians to move south of since the early days of the war - was made up of modern blocks of flats as well as shops, cafes, universities, schools, and parks. It was in these parks that people began to gather. Mahmoud could not understand why his neighbourhood had become a target. ""I tried my best to stop him. I asked, 'Why do you want to bomb?' ""He said, 'There are some things that we see that you don't see.'"" The man did not explain what he meant. ""It is an order from people bigger than me and you, and we have an order to bomb,"" the voice added, according to Mahmoud. When the areas around the buildings were clear the man informed Mahmoud that the bombing would begin. Mahmoud panicked - what if they bombed the wrong building by mistake? ""Wait a bit,"" the man told him, he says. An Israeli aircraft circled overhead. Mahmoud stared at the three towers that neighboured his own apartment block. Then one of them was bombed. ""This is the tower that we want, stay away,"" the man on the phone said as the building fell, according to Mahmoud. The two other blocks were then destroyed. Images taken in al-Zahra that morning show rubble in the place of those three apartment blocks, while a video shows residents wandering around in shock and bewilderment as they view the immediate aftermath of the strikes. A post on the community Facebook group at 08:28 local time says three towers had been ""wiped out completely"". When the bombing stopped, Mahmoud remembers the voice telling him: ""We've finished… you can go back."" Mahmoud didn't understand what he had just witnessed. He had lived in this Gaza neighbourhood for 15 years, running a busy dental practice and bringing up his children there. ""I told him al-Zahra is a civilian area. No one is a stranger here… I tried to make him understand. It is not a border area, we have not had previous clashes. It was always an area outside of trouble,"" he says. A post that morning on the community Facebook group urged neighbours to offer beds, food and water to those made homeless. People searched for shelter or places to flee to. Local authorities started clearing the debris from the roads, and putting out fires in the rubble. Those whose homes remained intact returned. Some people felt a sense of security. ""We went back [home], thinking they won't bomb again,"" one told us. Later that day, Mahmoud had just finished his Isha, or night-time prayers, at his flat when he saw a missed call from a private number on his phone. His heart sank. ""Immediately I understood there would be an evacuation and bombing, but I didn't know what the target would be. I thought it might be my home, it might be the home next to me,"" he says. His phone soon rang again. A different man was on the line. The voice said they had realised Mahmoud was a ""wise man"" after the events of that morning, which is why they were calling him again. The man introduced himself as Daoud. Mahmoud was unnerved by the level of detail the man had about his life - by the familiar way the man addressed him and referred to his son's name. According to Mahmoud's account, this man then made some attempt to explain what was happening in Gaza. ""He started telling me: 'Did you see how they [Hamas] slaughtered those children with knives?'… ""I told him that according to our Islamic religion, this is forbidden,"" Mahmoud recalls. He urged the voice against ""mass punishment"", but Mahmoud knew it was hopeless. Mahmoud says the man told him more buildings would be destroyed that night, and the dentist would need to order his neighbours to evacuate once again. At first, he was told the targets were two buildings next to the three that had been destroyed that morning, as well as a second block of towers. ""He said to me, 'We want you to inform people to evacuate the area,' and I said, 'You need to give me time.'"" He got to work. ""We evacuated all the people and even evacuated a third block because it was so close to the second one,"" Mahmoud says. At this point al-Zahra was largely in darkness. Residents say electricity had gone and they were using phones and torches for light as they filled the streets. Some had time to grab pre-packed bags as they left their homes, with items like spare clothing, water, phones and first aid kits. Others did not. ""It was absolute horror,"" one resident, Abdullah al-Khatib, says. ""We didn't know where to go. We literally just ran out, taking nothing."" ""Can't see clearly. Just evacuate,"" another says by WhatsApp message, recalling the events of that night. ""I just focus on being safe with family."" Mahmoud continued trying to buy as much time as he could, talking to the man who called himself Daoud until everyone was clear of the area and had been able to get into their cars if they wanted to drive away. Three buildings were destroyed. As Mahmoud watched the destruction, the man on the phone said three more buildings would be bombed and then the residents would be allowed to return. But a change of orders came suddenly. They would bomb the full row of apartment blocks on the eastern side of the street, Mahmoud recalls being told. This was more than 20 tower blocks, and hundreds of homes. ""There were people we hadn't evacuated yet because there was no warning about those buildings. I told him, 'At least give us until morning, in night time, where will the people go?' ""The answer was, 'The orders have been received, and we will bomb all towers within two hours.'"" Mahmoud screamed at people to clear the area, running from block to block. Residents describe chaotic scenes of adults shouting and children weeping. Some parents and children lost one another in the melee. Despite the panic, Mahmoud stayed on the phone the whole time, trying his best to delay the bombing. The voice on the other end of the phone continued, without emotion. ""He even told me, 'Take your time. I won't bomb unless you give me permission.' ""I said 'No, it's not my permission. I don't want you to bomb anything. If you want me to evacuate, I will evacuate for the safety of the people, but if you want to bomb, don't tell me you need my permission. ""'It's not Mahmoud Shaheen who will bomb al-Zahra.'"" An elderly disabled woman lived in the last block of apartment buildings. Mahmoud and those around him told locals to ""drive like crazy"" to reach her and get her out. He and others also worried about a local elderly care home. But the man on the phone said ""he'd just destroy the residential buildings"", according to Mahmoud. Mahmoud says what he and his neighbours witnessed that night ""wasn't a small bombing"" but the ""complete destruction of buildings"", as the residential blocks were levelled one by one. ""It was a very hard night for all the people of al-Zahra."" Photos and video footage posted by residents of the community show the aftermath of the evening bombing. A post on the Facebook group at 21:11 local time says: ""Al-Zahra towers are being bombed right now. God have mercy."" One resident speaking to the BBC via WhatsApp message recalled the confusion in the streets. ""We didn't know where we should go - some said we must go to schools, some said we should go to Al Nuseirat [a refugee camp south of the neighbourhood]. During that [time] came cruel bombs."" Mahmoud asked the man on the phone where he should take his neighbours. ""He said, 'Either take them east or west'. I said, 'To take them east will be hard, because to the east of al-Zahra is Al Mughraqa - an already unsafe area. People were already scared to go there.' ""He told me, 'Take them west to Palestine Street'. I suggested the University of Palestine and he said yes."" Mahmoud led the crowd, which included not just residents of the tower blocks, but also other displaced people who had sought shelter in al-Zahra after fleeing their own homes elsewhere in northern Gaza. Other residents have confirmed that they went to the university, and a video posted on the Facebook group shows people walking and driving in that direction, as the person behind the camera prays. Mahmoud says people waited at the university in fear, listening to the drumming of explosions outside. Frightened dogs in the street tried to find a spot to lie down between women and children. At one point, Mahmoud says the voice on the phone asked him how much battery he had left. He had 15%. They told him to hang up to preserve it and that they would call back again. Frequent calls followed. ""They would ring to tell me, 'Now we will bomb another building,' 'Now we will bomb another one.' They said, 'We will keep calling until we finish,'"" Mahmoud says. At one point a neighbour's phone rang, with the voice asking for Mahmoud Shaheen. Mahmoud had been keeping his distance from his wife and five children all day - both because he was busy evacuating people and because he feared that his contact with Israeli intelligence made him a target. At the university, he checked they were OK, and then left them again. The residents of al-Zahra endured a sleepless night. The crowd looked to Mahmoud for updates and answers. ""[They were] saying 'Hey doctor, did they call you so we can go back? Did they tell you where they will hit?'"" Dawn broke. A post on the community Facebook group at 08:53 local time said: ""The bombing is still going on up to this moment."" Videos shared overnight captured flashes of orange in the night sky. Others shot in the morning show plumes of grey smoke rising with the sun over the city. Mahmoud and the man who called himself Daoud kept speaking until the streets went quiet. Then the calls abruptly stopped without any further instructions for the people of al-Zahra. ""They didn't tell us to go back to our homes, or to evacuate or leave the area. So people waited until noon, and then they started to move,"" Mahmoud says. In the hours and days that followed, the community of al-Zahra, like many in Gaza, disbanded. ""Even for the people whose homes were still standing, there are no services left… the sewage systems are damaged, there is no bakery, there is no supermarket, there is no water, no electricity,"" Mahmoud says. Mahmoud's block was not destroyed, although it was severely damaged. The neighbourhood where he built up his dental practice over 15 years, and became a linchpin of the community, is now gone. There is nothing left for him in al-Zahra. He has taken his family to another region of Gaza, where he is staying in a friend's house that is crowded with people. ""I don't think about my clinic or my house, I just pray that I survive and stay alive,"" he says. ""Material things are nothing, you could die at any second right now. We don't think about anything else."" Israel is known to have warned Gazans by calling them, texting them and dropping leaflets before bombing. But in some cases, civilians say they have not been warned ahead of time. The IDF told the BBC that as part of its ""mission to dismantle the Hamas terrorist organisation [it] has been targeting military targets across the Gaza Strip"". Strikes on military targets were subject, it said, to ""relevant provisions of international law, including the taking of feasible precautions to mitigate civilian casualties"". ""Hamas continues to attack Israel from across the entire Gaza Strip. Hamas has embedded itself in civilian infrastructure and operates across the entire Gaza Strip. The IDF is determined to end these attacks and as such we will strike Hamas wherever necessary."" The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,000 people have been killed by Israel since the war began - more than a third of them are children. Israel's retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza followed Hamas gunmen rampaging into Israel on 7 October, killing 1,400 people, including many women and children, and taking hundreds of others hostage. Thanks to Mahmoud's efforts, it is believed that none of his neighbours died that day. But his account reveals the panic and anguish of a Palestinian community as they watched their homes and everything they love blow up around them. The BBC has spoken to multiple families who lived in al-Zahra, a neighbourhood of professionals and entrepreneurs, in which families ate falafel and pizza on the beach together, and children played football in the dawn light as the call to prayer sounded across the rooftops. In the second part of this story, we will bring you into the lives of the people who called this place home - of a prosperous and vibrant community that was eradicated overnight.

Israel says troops operating 'in the heart of Gaza City'Published7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli troops are operating ""in the heart of Gaza City"", Defence Minister Yoav Gallant says, as the country's military operation to destroy Hamas continues. He said troops on foot were being supported by armoured vehicles, tanks and military engineers. For its part Hamas said it was inflicting losses on Israeli forces and had destroyed military vehicles. The BBC cannot verify battle claims made by either side. Mr Gallant said troops were destroying Hamas infrastructure and Yahya Sinwar - the commander Israel says planned the group's devastating 7 October attack, killing 1,400 people - was isolated in his bunker. Israel's ground operation has been accompanied by devastating air strikes, which have killed more than 10,000 people, including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run health agency in Gaza. On Tuesday air strikes killed at least 23 people in the southern towns of Rafah and Khan Younis, Hamas-run health ministry officials said. Israel has told Gazans to go to southern Gaza for their own safety. World Health Organization spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the ""level of death and suffering"" in the conflict was ""hard to fathom"" and an average of 160 children in Gaza were being killed every day. Israeli leaders are making increasingly bold claims about their operation in Gaza - but their forces are clearly now well established in some of the most built-up areas of the city. The army has released video of Israeli armoured vehicles operating along the coast road well to the south of the city centre, underlining that Israel now has the entire area encircled. But none of this means that Gaza City is on the verge of collapse. It is seen as Hamas's biggest stronghold, full of tunnels and bunkers. Israel says some of these are under major hospitals, including the city's largest, al-Shifa. The Israeli advance into Gaza City has also triggered a fresh exodus of civilians, heeding Israeli warnings to leave their homes and head south. For several hours on Tuesday, hundreds of people were on the move. Some on carts pulled by donkeys. Most on foot. ""It was so scary,"" Ola al-Ghul told AFP news agency. ""We held our hands up and we kept walking. There were so many of us, we were holding white flags."" Holding a walking stick, Hatem Abu Riash described how he had to walk past heavily-armed Israeli troops after fleeing Jabalia refugee camp, north of Gaza City. ""Next to the soldiers, next to the guns, next to the tanks, the aeroplane... it was really horrible,"" he said. ""We are not terrorists - we are civilians - we want to live in peace,"" he added. But the BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern town of Khan Younis, says half a million people are believed to be still living in northern Gaza. One man in northern Gaza, Hamdi al-Hato, said he and his family could not leave because the road out was destroyed and he personally could not walk 5km because he had a weak heart. ""We are a family of nine people. I used to sell coffee and earn 20 shekels ($5; £4) a day. Today, I have no money left and we have no food, water, or anything. My children are starving,"" he told the BBC. Most large bakeries in northern Gaza are closed due to lack of flour and fuel. Following the air strikes on southern Gaza footage showed one man emerging from the smouldering ruins of his home in Khan Younis. ""They show their might and power against civilians,"" he said. ""Babies inside, kids inside."" A rescuer appeared to carry a dead baby out of the rubble, while a young girl waist-deep in rubble was slowly helped out. A neighbour, Abu Jihad, watched the scene. ""People have been destroyed, their lives are destroyed,"" he said. ""Thank God we are safe but I swear we are waiting for death each moment… it's a suspended death."" Later on Tuesday, Palestinian media reported that at least two residential buildings were destroyed in air strikes in the central town of Deir al-Balah. The number of casualties was not clear, but footage showed people carrying at least four bodies from the remains of a house where two families had reportedly been staying. The official Wafa news agency cited witnesses as saying that dozens of people were killed or wounded in the strikes. Meanwhile the Hamas military wing said it was continuing to fire rockets at Israeli cities and towns. A BBC team in Tel Aviv reported loud explosions in the sky above the city as Israel's Iron Dome air defence system intercepted the rockets.",2023-11-07T22:26:40.000Z

Canadian man chooses to stay in Gaza to document the warPublished7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Palestinian-Canadian father has decided to stay behind in Gaza, despite finally being allowed to leave the embattled enclave. Mansour Shouman told the BBC that he feels a responsibility to remain and document the events around him. He said his five children and wife are among the first Canadians who managed to cross safely into Egypt on Tuesday. Of the 80 Canadians approved to leave Gaza so far, about 75 have gotten out safely. Global Affairs Canada has said that they are aware of more than 400 Canadian citizens, permanent residents and their family members who want to leave through the Rafah crossing into Egypt. Mr Shouman, a management consultant, said that for him staying behind is an obligation. ""As long as 2.3 million people are suffering, I believe that it is my religious obligation, my humanitarian obligation to stay and tell the story about what is really happening,"" he said. ""I can speak English, I've lived in the West,"" said Mr Shouman, who has already spoken to several international news outlets, including the BBC Mr Shouman is an alum of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario and the University of Calgary in Alberta, and has worked for several years in Alberta's oil and gas sector. Originally from Jerusalem, Mr Shouman said that he and his family chose to move to the occupied Palestinian territories two years ago so that his children could grow up in their ancestral homeland. They chose to live in Gaza, he said, as it is his wife's hometown. ""We had been living a very nice life here,"" Mr Shouman said, despite the long-standing turmoil in the Gaza strip. ""Our kids were going to international school,"" he said. ""My wife and I were working. We had a lot of friends. The local mosque was great."" But he added he and his family never expected to be in the middle of the current war. Now, Mr Shouman has made a hospital in Khan Younis his home, where he sleeps in a small room next to the maternity ward. ""Whenever a new baby is born, I hear the good news,"" he said. The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened on Wednesday to allow a number of civilians to leave. Hundreds of foreign passport holders, including more than 400 Americans, have crossed so far. It was their first opportunity to do so since the war began on 7 October. The lists of those allowed to cross is agreed upon by Egypt and Israel. Then, the relevant countries are notified to ensure they are ready to receive their citizens. Canada's foreign ministry has said the ""situation is quite fluid and unpredictable"" and that people should be prepared ""for significant delays"". Just before 01:00 local time on Tuesday, Mr Shouman said his family received an email from Canada's foreign affairs ministry, telling them that they were on the list of those approved to evacuate out of Gaza. They were told to head to the border at 09:00, where they would be met by Canadian consular staff on the Egyptian side. There, they would stay for 72 hours to rest before traveling back to Canada. Mr Shouman said that as a husband and father, he had an urge to remain with his family. But ""the decision to stay behind was easy,"" he added. He said it is important for him to help in any way, ""even if I am just removing rubble from the ground, even if I am just covering the news"". Mr Shouman's family are among the first Canadians who have managed to leave, but hundreds of others are still stuck among bombed-out buildings, with dwindling supplies. The 73-year-old father of Samah Al-Sabbagh went to Gaza at the end of September to visit his family. She is frustrated that his name is not on the list of people able to leave. ""Every time I talk to my dad, I feel the despair in his voice,"" she said. ""He says to me 'every extra day we spend in Gaza is leading us to death.'"" Over the last month the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a ""complete siege"" and recently launched a ground assault on the north of Gaza. Ms Al-Sabbagh told the BBC that her father has witnessed the ongoing bombardment up close and has had to relocate four times for his safety. Some members of their family have also been killed, she said. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,300 people have been killed, including more than 4,000 children. Ms Al-Sabbagh wants Canadian officials to do whatever they can, including calling for a pause in fighting, so their citizens can safely evacuate. ""There is not a single safe place in Gaza,"" she said. In a statement on social media confirming the first group of Canadians had been evacuated, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said her department is still working on getting the rest out. ""You can rest assured that this is our number one priority,"" she said.",2023-11-07T19:51:23.000Z

Jewish man's death at duelling Israel-Palestinian protests ruled a homicidePublished7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Police are investigating the death of a Jewish man in California as a homicide following a clash between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Witnesses told Ventura County police that Paul Kessler, 69, was involved in a dispute with counter-protesters. ""During the altercation, Kessler fell backwards and struck his head on the ground,"" a police statement said. He died in hospital on Monday. A suspect has been identified but has so far not been charged or arrested. Mr Kessler was conscious when he was taken to a hospital on Sunday afternoon, but died of his injuries the next day. At a news conference on Tuesday, Ventura County Sheriff James Fryoff said that a suspect had ""remained willingly and was cooperative"" with officers who arrived at the scene. Police say the suspect claimed that he was among the witnesses who called 911 to request medical attention for Mr Kessler. The suspect - who has so far not been publicly identified- was later detained and released. A search warrant was also executed at his home in Moorpark, California. Police have said that there may be additional suspects. Authorities called the incident isolated but said they had not ruled out the possibility of a hate crime. Mr Fryoff said that witnesses had ""provided conflicting statements"" and that police were still investigating the events that led to the incident. ""What exactly transpired prior to Mr Kessler falling backwards isn't crystal clear right now,"" he added. The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles said that Kessler was hit by a megaphone wielded by a pro-Palestinian protester on Sunday afternoon. The use of a megaphone has not been confirmed by police, although Mr Fryoff said that ""the suspect was advocating for Palestine"". Officials have said that the ruling that the death was a homicide indicates that the death ""occurred at the hands of another person"" but is not necessarily an indication that a crime has been committed. That determination will be made by prosecutors. Rabbi Michael Barclay of Temple Ner Simcha, a synagogue close to the altercation, urged for calm until the police were able to complete their investigation. He said the community should not allow Kessler's death to ""become a spark that starts an inferno"". Hussam Ayloush, the executive director of the Los Angeles Council on American-Islamic Relations organisation, called the loss ""tragic and shocking"". ""We join local Jewish leaders in calling on all individuals to refrain from jumping to conclusions, sensationalising such a tragedy for political gains, or spreading rumours that could unnecessarily escalate tensions that are already at an all-time high,"" he said. Kessler's death has occurred during a tense time in the US over the Israel-Hamas war. Officials have warned of rising threats and religion-based hate crimes against Jewish and Muslim people since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. More than 1,400 people were killed and more than 200 kidnapped, says Israel. In Israel's retaliatory strikes on Gaza, more than 10,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Christopher Wray, the FBI director, told a Senate panel last week that the terror threat to Americans has been ""elevated throughout 2023"", but has risen again ""to a whole other level"" since the war began. In Ventura County, rising tensions prompted police to increase patrols at mosques, synagogues and community centres. Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid, senior Israeli lawmakers, also commented on the death, saying it should serve as a warning on the rise of antisemitism. Demonstrators supporting Israel and those protesting over the rising number of Palestinian deaths have gathered each weekend to support their sides of the conflict.",2023-11-07T19:36:33.000Z

"Gaza journalist killed alongside 42 relatives, news agency saysPublished7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","A Palestinian reporter has been killed alongside 42 family members, his news agency says, as a watchdog said the past month had been the most deadly for journalists since its records began. The Wafa news agency said Mohammad Abu Hasira was killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza City. At least 37 journalists had been killed since the war began, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said. These include 32 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese. The CPJ said it was unclear whether all had been covering the conflict at the time of their deaths but said it was including them in its count while it investigated the circumstances. The group began documenting journalist fatalities in 1992. Last month Israel told international news organisations Reuters and AFP that it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists operating in the Gaza Strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was targeting Hamas throughout Gaza and accused the group of placing military operations ""in the vicinity of journalists and civilians"". Israeli air strikes could additionally damage nearby buildings, the IDF said. On Saturday AFP called on Israel to investigate an air strike that severely damaged its office located on the top floors of an 11-storey building. ""A strike on the offices of an international news agency sends a deeply troubling message to all the journalists working in such difficult conditions in Gaza,"" said AFP boss Fabrice Fries. Last week, Mohammad Abu Hatab, a correspondent for the Palestine TV news channel was killed in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip in an Israeli airstrike, along with 11 members of his family. His colleague Salman Al-Bashir broke down in tears on air when learning of his death, removing his vest and helmet saying that the even the protective gear was not keeping journalists alive. Two Israeli photographers, Roee Idan and Yaniv Zohar, and members of their families were killed when Hamas attacked kibbutzes Kfar Aza and Nahal Oz on 7 October. Two Israeli reporters, Shai Regev and Ayelet Arnin, were killed during the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festival onthe same day, Israeli media reported. In Lebanon, prominent Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah was killed when covering Israeli rockets fired over the Israel-Lebanon border on 13 October. He was part of a group of journalists near the border town of Alma al-Shaab in southern Lebanon when he was hit by a rocket. Six other journalists were also injured in the strike. Shortly before Abdallah was killed, he posted on Instagram a picture of himself wearing a helmet and a flak jacket with the word ""press"" written on it. Six other journalists, including from Reuters, Al Jazeera and Agency France-Presse, were wounded. One of them, Reuters video journalist Maher Nazeh, said the teams ""were filming missile fire coming from the direction of Israel when one struck Abdallah as he was sitting on a low stone wall near the rest of the group"", according to a report published by the news agency. IDF spokesman Richard Hecht said the army was ""deeply regretful for the incident"" and was ""actively investigating it"" without saying that Israeli military was behind it. More than 10,300 people have been killed during Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel's retaliatory strikes began in response to Hamas' brutal 7 October attack, when the group killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages.",2023-11-07T19:23:33.000Z

Canadian poet Rupi Kaur declines White House visit over GazaPublished7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Canadian poet Rupi Kaur has declined an invitation to a Diwali celebration at the White House in protest against the Biden administration's response to the Israel-Hamas war. In apost on social media, Ms Kaur said she refuses ""any invitation from an institution that supports the collective punishment"" of civilians. She also called on other South Asians to hold the US government accountable. The Diwali event is due to take place on 8 November. It will be hosted by Vice-President Kamala Harris, who has yet to comment on the remarks. Ms Kaur, the India-born poet behind the critically-acclaimed book Milk and Honey, said she is ""surprised this administration finds it acceptable to celebrate Diwali"" - the Hindu festival of lights - as it is ""a celebration of righteousness over falsehood and knowledge over ignorance"". She accused the US government of justifying ""genocide against Palestinians"". The war began on 7 October after Hamas attacked Israel, resulting in more than 1,400 people being killed, according to Israeli authorities. Some 240 others are being held hostage in Gaza. Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said that more than 10,300 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's retaliatory attacks on the enclave, including more than 4,100 children. An Israeli siege on the enclave has also severely restricted access to food, water and fuel for the 2.2 million people living in Gaza. Ms Kaur also criticised President Joe Biden's refusal to support a humanitarian ceasefire, which is backed by the UN. ""As a Sikh woman, I will not allow my likeness to be used in whitewashing this administration's actions,"" Ms Kaur said. Mr Biden has instead advocated for a humanitarian ""pause"" in the fighting, as have Canada and the EU. The president reiterated his support for Israel on a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, according to a White House readout. Mr Biden also emphasised ""the imperative to protect Palestinian civilians and reduce civilian harm in the course of military operations"", it said. The administration has called on Congress to provide more than $14bn (£11.4bn) in aid to Israel, and has previously announced $100m in aid to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.",2023-11-07T17:01:40.000Z

Could an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Published7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel's leaders have declared that Hamas will be wiped off the face of the Earth and Gaza will never go back to what it was. ""We have set two goals for the war: to eliminate Hamas by destroying its military and governing capabilities and to do everything possible to bring our hostages at home,"" announced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as Israel expanded its ground operations in Gaza. Operation Swords of Iron began in response to the killing of more than 1,400 people by Hamas gunmen in a brutal attack on Israeli communities, and Israel's chief of staff has said the military are fighting ""for our right and the right of future generations to live in safety"". That goal of ending Hamas rule has been endorsed by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in October that the final phase of Israel's Gaza plan was for a ""new security regime"" there, with no Israeli responsibility for daily life.  Mr Netanyahu has since said ""Israel will, for an indefinite period have the overall security responsibility"", to prevent further Hamas attacks. Israel's aims appear far more ambitious than anything the military has planned in Gaza before. But are they realistic, and how can its commanders possibly fulfil them? Entering the Gaza Strip involves house-to-house urban fighting and carries immense risks to a civilian population of more than two million. Officials in Hamas-run Gaza say 10,000 people have already been killed, and hundreds of thousands more have fled their homes. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have the added task of rescuing 240 hostages, held in unknown locations across Gaza. ""I don't think Israel can dismantle every Hamas member, because it's an idea of extremist Islam,"" says military analyst Amir Bar Shalom of Israel's Army Radio. ""But you can weaken it as much as you can so it has no operational capabilities."" Weakening it so it no longer poses a military threat to Israelis might be a more realistic objective than dismantling it entirely. Israel has already fought four wars with Hamas, and every attempt to halt its rocket attacks has failed. Michael Milstein, head of the Palestinian studies forum of Tel Aviv University, agrees destroying Hamas would be highly complicated. He says it would be pretentious to believe you could uproot the idea that embodies Hamas - an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has influenced Islamist movements around the world. Quite apart from the 25,000-plus strength of Hamas's military wing, it has 80-90,000 more members who are part of its social welfare infrastructure, or Dawa, he says. In Antony Blinken's words, Hamas's ""perverted idea"" has to be combated with a ""better idea"" and a vision that gives people something to hope for. The military operation is at the mercy of several factors that could derail it. Hamas's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, has the use ofan extensive network of tunnelsand it has targeted Israeli forces with snipers and fighters armed with anti-tank missiles. The civilian death toll has soared since ground operations expanded on 27 October, and the IDF has lost increasing numbers of soldiers in combat. Israelis have been warned to prepare for a long war, and a record 360,000 reservists have reported for duty. The question is how long Israel can continue its campaign as international pressure grows for a ceasefire, with supplies of water, power and fuel cut off, and UN warnings of an unfolding human catastrophe. ""The government and military feel they have the backing of the international community - at least Western leaders,"" says Yossi Melman, one of Israel's leading security and intelligence journalists. But sooner or later he believes Israel's allies will step in. ""It's very complicated because it needs time and the US administration won't let you stay in Gaza for a year or two,"" says Michael Milstein. Many of the hostages are Israelis, but there are also a large number of foreign citizens and dual nationals among them, meaning several other governments - including the US, France and the UK - have a stake in this operation and their safe release. Heart-rending appeals from families of those in Hamas captivity are ramping up pressure on Israel's leaders, and Hamas's political leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, has said they are ready to swap all the hostages for the thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. That kind of deal is unlikely. In 2011, Israel exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for the release of a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held by Hamas for five years. Yahya Sinwar was among those freed, and is now their top man in Gaza. What could also affect the duration and outcome of a ground offensive is how Israel's neighbours react. Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza has become a humanitarian focal point for supplies getting into Gaza. Hundreds of foreign passport holders and some of the wounded have been allowed to leave but more remain. ""The more Gazans suffer following the Israeli military campaign, the more pressure Egypt will face, to appear as if it has not turned its back on the Palestinians,"" says Ofir Winter of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. But that will not stretch to Cairo allowing a mass crossing of Gazans into northern Sinai. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has said Egypt rejects any attempt to move Gazans forcibly into the Sinai peninsula, adding that it would prompt Egyptians to ""go out and protest in their millions"". An internal Israeli intelligence ministry policy paper has raised the prospect of the Gaza population being expelled from the territory, but only a handful of far-right politicians have shown interest in the idea. Jordan's King Abdullah has talked of a ""red line"" for any possible attempt at pushing Palestinian refugees out of Gaza: ""No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,"" he warned. Israel's northern border with Lebanon is also under close scrutiny. There have already been regular, deadly cross-border attacks involving Islamist militant group Hezbollah, and communities on both sides have been evacuated. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has said ""all options are open"", but for the moment there is no indication of a broader axis against Israel opening up from the north. Hezbollah's main sponsor, Iran, has threatened ""new fronts"" against Israel, and Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have fired missiles and drones towards Israel too. But US President Joe Biden has issued a stern warning to Iran and its allies: ""To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't!"" Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and USS Eisenhower, have been sent to the eastern Mediterranean to emphasise that message, and some 2,000 US troops have been placed on alert to respond to unfolding events. If Hamas were to be significantly weakened, the question is what would go in its place. Israel pulled its army and thousands of settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 and government officials have said repeatedly they have ""no desire to occupy or reoccupy Gaza"". US President Joe Biden has said any move to occupy it again ""would be a big mistake"". A month into the war, Benjamin Netanyahu said once the war was over, it would be governed by ""those who don't want to continue the way of Hamas"", and that Israel would ""for an indefinite period"" have overall security responsibility. While not the same as re-occupation, it implies Israel would demand a substantial role. Ofir Winter believes a shift in power could potentially pave the way for the gradual return of the Palestinian Authority (PA), kicked out from Gaza by Hamas in 2007. The PA currently controls parts of the West Bank, but is weak there, and persuading it to return to Gaza would be highly complicated. Antony Blinken has said it would make ""most sense... for an effective and revitalised"" PA to run Gaza, although a number of other countries in the region could take part in ""temporary arrangements"" that might involve international agencies. What is clear is that a power vacuum would lead to even more problems. The United Nations could theoretically fill the gap in running Gaza temporarily, as it did in Kosovo after Serbian forces withdrew in 1999. But that kind of solution would not go down well in Israel, where the UN is widely mistrusted. Another option might be to create an administration, run by Gaza's mayors, tribes, clans and non-governmental organisations, with involvement from Egypt and the US, the PA and other Arab states, says Michael Milstein. Egypt's president has himself shown no interest in controlling Gaza but has pointed out that if a ""demilitarised Palestinian state had been created long ago in negotiations, there would not be a war now"". Gaza's devastated infrastructure will ultimately have to be rebuilt in the way it was after earlier wars. Israel will want even tighter restrictions on ""dual-use goods"" entering Gaza that could have a military and civilian purpose. And there have been calls for an expanded buffer zone along the fence with Gaza to provide greater protection for Israeli communities.",2023-11-07T15:10:23.000Z

South African divisions exposed by Israel-Hamas conflictPublished7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The war between Israel and Hamas has exposed deep divisions in South Africa, with the government's staunch support for the Palestinians coming in for criticism from leaders of the country's Jewish community, among others. The government has announced the withdrawal of its diplomats from Israel, and suggested that the position of Israel's ambassador to Pretoria was becoming ""untenable"". This has been sharply criticised by the country's Jewish Board of Deputies which has called for an urgent meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa. South African sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back to the days of late anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela. He famously said in 1997, three years after he became the country's first democratically elected president after decades of struggle against white-minority rule: ""We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians."" The unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel, which killed some 1,400 people, has not changed the position of the country's ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), even though two South African nationals were among the dead and another is among the more than 230 people taken hostage. President Ramaphosa has pledged the ANC's solidarity with the Palestinians,saying their history had echoes of apartheid- and South Africa's struggle against white-minority rule. Although he did condemn the Hamas assault, a week later he led 60 party leaders as they waved Palestinian flags, while wearing the traditional chequered black and white Palestinian scarf, the keffiyeh. ""They are people who have been under occupation for almost 75 years,"" he said of the Palestinians. ""They have been waiting and waging a war against a government that has been dubbed an apartheid state. ""We have always pledged our solidarity, and have always insisted that the only solution, especially with the issues of Palestine, is a two-state solution."" South Africa's foreign ministry has gone even further, suggesting that the Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 10,000 people,might amount to a genocide. In the statement announcing the withdrawal of its diplomats, Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor accused the Israelis of imposing ""collective punishment"" on Palestinian civilians - an allegation rejected by Israel. The government has not commented on the South African hostage, or named them. Its pro-Palestinian position has been condemned by the country's Jewish Board of Deputies, the South African Zionist Federation and the largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA). Because of the passionate views on both sides, some South African talk radio stations have deliberately limited airtime around taking calls from listeners keen to discuss the war between Israel and Hamas. Large pro-Palestinian protest marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began. Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Last Friday members of the Jewish community hung up 221 big red balloons across Johannesburg's Nelson Mandela Bridge to bring attention to the Israeli hostages and call for their release. One ANC official, Gabriella Farber, resigned from the party, accusing it of ""supporting Hamas"". ""It has been made very clear to me that there is no space for a proud Jew to belong to the ANC no matter how hard I tried,""she said in her resignation letter posted on X, formerly Twitter. ""It took the ANC nine days until they condemned Hamas for the atrocities they committed against the Jewish people. When the ANC condemned Hamas in the very next sentence they stated that Israel is committing a genocide,"" she said as she stepped down as spokesperson for the ANC Women's League in the Gauteng region. The government's stance has also drawn stinging criticism from Warren Goldstein, chief rabbi of The Union of Orthodox Synagogues of South Africa. ""I want to tell the president and I want to tell the ANC, you are not South Africa,"" he told an SA Zionist Federation rally for Israel. ""This president, his party and this government is supporting an evil savagery that has shocked the hearts of all decent human beings in the world. How dare they?"" But South Africa's Jewish community, believed to number around 65,000, is not united in its condemnation of the government's support for the Palestinians. Award-winning cartoonist Jonathan Shapiro, who identifies as a ""secular Jew"", says it is important to remember that many senior ANC figures during the fight against apartheid were Jewish and they did not support Israel. ""I think Farber must be very blind to the fact that most significant Jewish heroes of the anti-apartheid struggle were to a great extent very much against the Israel colonial project,"" Shapiro, better known by his pen name Zapiro, told the BBC. He pointed to top ANC officials such as Joe Slovo, Arthur Goldreich, Rusty Bernstein, Ronnie Kasrils and Amy Thornton, saying they had a ""background as socialists or communists or, in general, people who want to see justice in struggles wherever they are fought"". He said that Ms Farber could not pretend that ""the ANC was somehow neutral on the issue of Palestine"". During the struggle against white-minority rule, the ANC developed close ties with erstwhile leaders such as Cuba's Fidel Castro, Libya's Muammar Gaddafi as well as Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO). They all helped with material or moral support and saw one another as fellow liberation movements. Arafat was one of the first leaders Mandela met after being released from prison on 11 February 1990. The late PLO leader was among a group of leaders from South Africa's neighbours who had helped in the fight against apartheid who met Mandela in Zambia just two weeks after his release from 27 years in prison. Although Mandela never set any conditions for the meeting, Arafat had already moved to accept Israel's right to exist and a few years later he signed the Oslo Accords. Under these, the PLO recognised Israel's right to exist and renounced terrorism in exchange for moves towards Palestinian self-rule for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Foreign Minister Pandor has come under particular fire for having a telephone conversation with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh just a few days after the 7 October attack. Ms Pandor shrugged off the criticism, telling national broadcaster SABC that the ANC's experience of fighting the apartheid government was that the only way of finding a solution to a conflict was by talking to your enemies. ""South Africa is always dedicated to finding solutions and to promoting peace. When the Hamas leadership asked to speak to me, I agreed and I conveyed the wish of South Africa that there be peace. This is my responsibility to do. ""When the apartheid state wanted to speak to our leaders we didn't say: 'They've been harming us, they've imprisoned our fathers and grandfathers.' We said: 'Let's talk.' This is the South African character,"" she said. Mr Ramaphosa, who played a prominent role in securing a negotiated settlement in Northern Ireland, says South Africa is ready to help mediate in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, drawing on its experience of conflict resolution. However, South Africa's Jewish Board of Deputies points out that if it were to expel Israel's ambassador that would ""be a decision contrary to everything that the government claims it stands for, that is talking to both sides of the conflict"".",2023-11-07T14:56:50.000Z

Rochdale family leave Gaza after 'absolutely harrowing month'Published7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The mother of a woman who was trapped in Gaza with her husband and her in-laws has said the group have managed to cross the border into Egypt. Lalah Ali-Faten said Zaynab Al-Wandawi and other Al-Attar family members went to Gaza from Rochdale two days beforeHamas attacked Israel on 7 October. She said they had faced an ""absolutely harrowing month"" but had gone through the Rafah crossing on Monday night. She added that she was ""so grateful that they were able to leave"". It is believed about 200 British nationals were in Gaza when fighting began. Ms Al-Wandawi, 29, and her husband were among those trapped, along with his mother, his seven brothers, her sister-in-law and another family member. The Al-Attar family had travelled to the region for a wedding in early October and have been trying to leave ever since. Ms Al-Wandawi, an English language teacher, and a group of 12 relatives - 10 of whom were British nationals - attempted to cross the border into Egypt previously, but were told their names were not on the list. However, nine of the group were able to cross on Monday night, with two of Ms Al-Wandawi's brothers-in-law staying in Gaza in order to help the remaining family member leave. Ms Ali-Faten, from Prestwich in Greater Manchester, said the last month had been ""a waking nightmare"" and she was ""so thankful"" the majority of the group were now in Egypt. ""We've had quite a late night,"" she said. ""As soon as we heard the Rafah crossing was open, the family immediately made their way to the border. ""It took a few hours to get processed and when they came out, they had representatives from the British embassy waiting for them."" Ms Ali-Faten said once they were in Egypt, the group were put on a coach and taken to Cairo where they will be ""for a couple of days"" before beginning their journey back to the UK. She said hearing the news that they had made the crossing made her feel ""ten times lighter"", but added that she also felt ""guilt, because they have the privilege of leaving Gaza while others don't"". ""I know there are so many Palestinian families that weren't able to leave because they don't have the luxury of having a nationality that will get you out of that warzone,"" she said. She added that it would ""take some time"" for her daughter to ""decompress"" and ""acclimatise back to her normal environment"". ""She called me when she was sitting on the bus because they were waiting for the bus to fill up with British nationals,"" she said. ""She sounded more herself than I've heard her over the last month, she sounded more like Zaynab when I was speaking with her. ""She sounded kind of peppy and she had energy in her voice."" She added that it had been ""an absolutely harrowing month"". ""They've been in a war zone and the images that are coming out from Gaza are disturbing and so horrific that you wouldn't wish it on anybody,"" she said. ""To know that your daughter's there, her husband and his extended family and there's nothing that you could do to to get them out, it's been awful.""

Israeli archaeologists help find remains of Hamas attack victimsPublished7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Archaeologists have been enlisted to help Israel's military identify the remains of some of the 1,400 people killed in Hamas's attack a month ago. They have been combing through and sieving the ash from burnt houses in which families from Kibbutz Be'eri, Kfar Aza and Nir Oz were murdered, the Israel Antiquities Authority says. They have also been checking burnt cars at a festival site where hundreds died. The IAA says the remains of at least 10 missing people have so far been found. Some of them have since been buried, while other evidence has been brought for further examination at the Shura military base in central Israel. On 7 October, an estimated 1,500 Hamas gunmen breached the Gaza perimeter fence under a barrage of rockets and then systematically attacked anyone they came across at nearby southern Israeli communities and military posts, as well as the outdoor Supernova music festival. The UN says the names of 1,159 Israelis and foreign nationals who were killed, including 828 civilians, have so far been released by Israeli authorities. Of those whose ages have been provided, 31 were children. Another 242 people, including about 30 children, were taken hostage. The Israel Antiquities Authority said in a statement on Tuesday that its archaeologists had been asked by Colonel Yossi Cohen of the Israeli military's Gaza Division two weeks ago to help search for missing people in houses and cars that were incinerated in the attack. ""The archaeological methods employed at ancient sites are similar to the methods applied here,"" it cited the archaeologists as saying. ""But it is one thing to expose 2,000-year-old destruction remains, and quite another thing - heart-rending and unfathomable - to carry out the present task searching for evidence of our sisters and brothers in the settlements."" A video posted online by the IAAshowed a team of archaeologists and soldiers inside several destroyed houses in Kibbutz Be'eri. They are seen carefully inspecting ash and other charred debris on the floor with trowels and removing personal items from a sieve. ""I believe and hope that we found the missing father,"" one of archaeologists is heard saying. ""In the same house, we found several bodies of terrorists together with their weapons,"" he adds. ""There was a lot of blood, shocking things that shouldn't be described here."" Another archaeologist vows: ""We will continue until we get to the last burnt house and we know that we have found everyone we possibly can.""",2023-11-07T13:36:31.000Z

Netanyahu says Israel will have security control over Gaza after warPublished7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will have ""overall security responsibility"" for the Gaza Strip ""for an indefinite period"". Mr Netanyahu's first comments on Israel's plan for Gaza after the war came in an interview with the ABC News network in the US. However, he did not elaborate on the kind of security mechanism such a plan would involve. Israel says it aims to destroy Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities and a music festival on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people, Israeli authorities say, in the bloodiest such event in Israel's history. Hamas - proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western governments, including the UK - also took 242 people hostage, the Israeli military says. Israel declared war on Hamas the same day and has been attacking Gaza from land, sea and air since then. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more more than 10,000 people have been killed since Israel began its operation. When asked who should govern Gaza - home to 2.2 million Palestinians - after the war, Mr Netanyahu said only ""those who don't want to continue the way of Hamas"". But he also declared that Israel must have security control. ""I think Israel will, for an indefinite period, have the overall security responsibility, because we have seen what happens when we don't have it. ""When we don't have that security responsibility, we have the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine."" Before the war, Israel - along with Egypt, which also shares a border with Gaza - blockaded the territory to try to stop weapons reaching the militant Islamist group and prevent it from carrying out attacks. Israel also controlled its border with Gaza, as well as Gaza's air space and shoreline, implementing a strict security regime and allowing in only certain vetted goods, as well as food, fuel and medicine. Imports were often halted after attacks from the territory. Despite Israel's controls, Hamas and other armed groups have frequently carried out attacks against it, with Israel repeatedly hitting Gaza with air strikes in response. Although it is unclear what type of security control Mr Netanyahu envisages, any return to long-term occupation on the ground is likely to be opposed by the international community. One week after the war began, US President Joe Biden said a re-occupation by Israel of Gaza would be ""a big mistake"". Although Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, the UN considers the territory as remaining under Israeli occupation.",2023-11-07T13:31:59.000Z

Army veteran Jim Henderson said he was punched and kicked as he tried to pack up his stall at Waverley Station in Edinburgh on Saturday. Hundreds of people hadoccupied the station concourseto protest against the Israel-Gaza war. British Transport Police (BTP) have confirmed officers are investigating. BTP Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said: ""We are working with ScotRail regarding the investigation.""

Hamas leader refuses to acknowledge killing of civilians in IsraelPublished7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A senior Hamas leader has refused to acknowledge that his group killed civilians in Israel, claiming only conscripts were targeted. Moussa Abu Marzouk told the BBC that ""women, children and civilians were exempt"" from Hamas's attacks. His claims are in stark contrast to the wealth of evidence of Hamas men shooting unarmed adults and children. The proof includes video from Hamas body cameras and first-hand testimony given to international news networks. Israel says more than 1,400 people were killed by Hamas in the 7 October attacks, most of them civilians. Mr Marzouk, the group's deputy political leader, who is subject to an asset freeze in the UK undercounter-terrorism regulations, was interviewed on Saturday in the Gulf. He is the most senior member to speak to the BBC since the 7 October atrocities. The BBC pressed Mr Marzouk on the war on Gaza, specifically on the scores of hostages being held inside the territory. He responded that they were not able to be freed while Israel was bombing Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says 10,000 people have been killed since Israel started operations last month. ""We will release them. But we need to stop the fighting,"" he said. Mr Marzouk recently travelled to Moscow to discuss eight Russian-Israeli dual citizens snatched on 7 October by Hamas, a proscribed terror organisation in many countries including the UK and US. He said Hamas members in Gaza had ""looked for and found two female hostages"" from Russia but were unable to release them because of the conflict. They could only realistically release hostages, he said, if ""the Israelis stop the ﬁghting so we can hand them over to the Red Cross"". Challenged by the BBC about the attack of 7 October, Mr Marzouk claimed that Mohamed el-Deif, the leader of Hamas's Qassam Brigades military wing, had ordered his men to spare civilians. ""El-Deif clearly told his fighters 'don't kill a woman, don't kill a child and don't kill an old man',"" he said. Reservist soldiers were, he said, ""targeted"". He maintained that only ""conscripts [...] or soldiers"" were killed. But women, children and civilians were ""exempt"", he said. Yet a huge body of evidence has been gathered which documents the range of bloody acts committed by Hamas in Israel on 7 October. BBC journalists went to the scene of the attacks in their immediate aftermath and saw the bodies of civilians who had been killed. We have also verified CCTV footage which captured shootings by Hamas. Separately, footage from Hamas body cameras has been shown to the BBC and other journalists by the Israeli government. Other international news organisations have also pieced together, and verified, evidence of what happened on the day. The BBC challenged Mr Marzouk on this, but the leader, whose polished, measured manner during the interview sometimes slipped into irritation, did not answer the question directly. When asked if Hamas's political wing had known of preparations for the attack, the deputy leader said that the armed wing ""don't have to consult with the political leadership. There is no need."" The political wing, based in Qatar, often presents itself as being remote from the military forces in Gaza. The UK government sees no distinction - it proscribed the Hamas political wing as a terrorist organisation in 2021, saying that ""the approach of distinguishing between the various parts of Hamas is artificial. Hamas is a complex butsingle terrorist organisation"". Mr Marzouk is also listed as aspecially designated global terroristby the US Treasury Department, and is indicted on several charges ofco-ordinating and financingHamas activities. The interview on Saturday came after Israel hadrefused US requestsfor a ""humanitarian pause"" in Gaza to let aid in and help get out some of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Friday all hostages must be released before any temporary truce could be agreed. Mr Marzouk claimed that Hamas did not possess a list of all those he referred to as ""guests"", nor did he know where many were, because they were being held by ""different factions"". There are several groups inside Gaza including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which work closely with Hamas but are ostensibly independent. He said a ceasefire was needed to compile the information - there were other priorities while the territory was under bombardment. Mr Marzouk will play a key role in how the conflict with Israel plays out, and is likely to be central in negotiations over the hostages.

Rashida Tlaib's claims of genocide in Gaza draw bipartisan criticismPublished7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"House Republicans have introduced two separate measures to censure a Democrat amid cross-party criticism of her comments on the Israel-Gaza war. Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American member of Congress, had posted a video accusing President Joe Biden of supporting genocide in Gaza. The White House and several Democrats criticised that and other remarks. Ms Tlaib said her colleagues were ""more focused on silencing me than they are on saving lives"". In a video posted to social media on Friday, Ms Tlaib directly addressed President Biden and called for a ceasefire. It features clips of Mr Biden stating his support for Israel, followed by clips of the dead and injured in Gaza and pro-Palestinian protests across the US. ""Joe Biden supported the genocide of the Palestinian people,"" titles at the end of the video read. ""The American people won't forget."" The video also features people chanting the slogan ""from the river to the sea"", which some use to call for Palestinian control of all land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, including Israel. Jewish groups likethe Anti-Defamation Leaguesay the slogan is a call for the destruction of the state of Israel. That interpretation is disputed by pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself. Representing a Michigan district that includes parts of Detroit and Dearborn, Ms Tlaib is one of just three Muslim lawmakers in Congress. She has long angered party leaders and pro-Israel groups with her unflinching criticism of Israel. Defending her latest remarks, she said the slogan is ""an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate"". But the comment has drawn criticism from all corners, including from Democratic allies in her own state. In a tweet to Ms Tlaib, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the use of the phrase ""hurtful"". ""I have supported and defended you countless times, even when you have said the indefensible, because I believed you to be a good person. Please retract this cruel and hateful remark,"" Ms Nessel wrote. Michigan Senate President Pro Tem Jeremy Moss, another Democrat, said Ms Tlaib's comments were insensitive to Jewish people. On Monday, Georgia Republican Rich McCormick introduced a resolution to censure Ms Tlaib for ""calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and dangerously promoting false narratives"". Meanwhile, other progressive Democrats in Congress, like Pramila Jayapal from Washington, declined to side with Ms Tlaib's comments. Jon Finer, the White House deputy national security advisor, said on Sunday that the Biden administration disagrees ""with some of that messaging and with some of the terms used to describe this conflict"". More than 1,400 Israelis were killed in Hamas attacks on 7 October. Since then, more than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. The Biden administration has so far stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, but has become increasingly cautious in its language on the conflict as it seeks to balance competing interests. Mr Biden has repeatedly said that he supports Israel's right to defend itself, while pushing for pauses in fighting to allow humanitarian aid, food and water into Gaza.",2023-11-07T08:54:24.000Z

Israel's pain still raw a month after Hamas attacksPublished7 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"It was a day that shattered Israel's sense of its own invincibility and military might, undermining the security felt by every one of its citizens. But it did not seem so extraordinary at the start. When I saw the early morning ""red alerts"" on my phone warning of incoming rocket fire from Gaza, we had no idea of the scale of the assault. I messaged my colleagues - some of whom were away for the end of the Jewish holidays - to say that I would head to the office. Soon I was struggling to absorb the impact of what I was saying on-air, even as the words left my mouth. The intense missile fire which had me running in and out of the office air raid shelter turned out to be a cover for an unprecedented, complex, long-planned series of attacks. We saw shocking images of Hamas fighters riding motorbikes through holes cut in Gaza's perimeter fence, paragliding into southern Israel, storming heavily fortified military bases and filming themselves in the gardens of overrun kibbutzim. Over painful hours, partygoers called into Israeli TV stations describing massacres as they hid from gunmen at the now notorious Nova Music Festival. Terrified residents shared videos of armed Palestinian squads on the streets of Sderot. It was to prove to be the deadliest day in Israel's 75-year history with people murdered systematically and ruthlessly. From some of the kibbutzim close to Gaza, footage later emerged showing the cold-blooded massacre of entire families. Ultimately, some 1,400 are estimated to have been killed. The significance of the timing was not lost - as this onslaught came almost exactly 50 years after a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur, sparked a major regional war. The raw pain and shock for ordinary Israelis, still evident now, was on full display when I went to Ashkelon on 8 October. As Israeli security forces continued to battle heavily armed men literally along the road from us, and rocket sirens continued to blare, at the hospital, parents searched tearfully and collapsed in anguish searching for their missing children. ""Raze Gaza!"" one tormented mother shouted. Early on in the war, there was a thirst for revenge and an urgent desire to restore Israel's deterrence in front of its enemies.  However, polls suggest this has since been complicated by growing fears about the impact that intense bombardment and a full-scale ground invasion could have on hostages snatched by Hamas. Some 240 people are thought to be held: Israelis and foreigners, soldiers and civilians and old and young.  Demonstrations and pleas to bring them home are becoming more urgent. After surviving the nightmare of the Hamas attacks in Nir Oz, the life of Hadas Kalderon is now transformed into desperately campaigning to bring home her two children, Erez, who turned 12 as a hostage in Gaza, Sahar, 16, and Hadas's ex-husband, Ofer. Her mother, Carmela Dan, and her niece, Noya, who were also abducted, have been found dead. ""I don't even have time to grieve [for] my mother and my niece because I have to fight for my children and their father that's still alive,"" Hadas recently told the BBC.  She calls for Israel to stop its military activity until the hostages are safe. Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire without the release of all the hostages, and has continued bombarding Gaza from the air. On Monday, the Hamas-run health ministry inGaza said that more than 10,000 people have been killedin the Palestinian territory since Israel started bombing it last month. More than 4,000 of those killed were children, the ministry added. What compounded the shock of 7 October was the realisation that Israel's military, the strongest in the Middle East, and its renowned intelligence forces had failed to detect the attacks.  Many long-time assumptions they had held, together with political leaders, also turned out to be seriously flawed. After Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, and Hamas took full control of the territory in 2007, Israeli authorities had tried to limit the threat it posed along with Islamic Jihad, its smaller ally, also designated as a terrorist group. It had become common to hear defence experts refer to Israel's strategy in Gaza as ""mowing the lawn"". The suggestion was that the capabilities of the armed factions could simply be cut back every now and then by Israeli forces - with all that meant in terms of casualties. There were frequent major conflicts as recently as 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021. However, in two previous short rounds of violence in August last year and May this year, which targeted Islamic Jihad, Israel's military took false comfort that Hamas did not join in.  The conventional wisdom was that it did not want an escalation. Israel was thought to have bought relative quiet by giving work permits to some 18,000 Gazans and by allowing Qatar to give aid and pay Hamas civil servants' salaries. That assessment proved to be dangerously erroneous. It now seems clear that Hamas was actually biding its time while gaining better weapons, including longer-range rockets and drones, and improving its underground tunnel network. The idea that Israeli technology had also contained the threat from Hamas - particularly with the costly barrier that was built around Gaza complete with cameras, sensors and a deep concrete base to guard against tunnels - was also shown to be wrong.  Last month, thousands of fighters are said to have penetrated the fence in about 30 places. With war still raging, it is still too soon to give a full list of the mistakes made which led to 7 October. Israel remains in a state of mourning with the bodies of some of the dead - burnt or mutilated - still unidentified and more soldiers being killed on the battlefield inside Gaza. However, a wide-ranging, post-war inquiry eventually seems likely. After a turbulent year in Israeli politics, questions may well be asked about the role of the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Much still depends on how effectively Israel can achieve its new war goals - to dismantle Hamas in Gaza and release the hostages - and deal with the growing threats posed by Iran and its proxies in the region. One month on from those bloody events in southern Israel, the news remains relentless.",2023-11-07T07:35:22.000Z

Met Police urges pro-Palestinian march organisers to delay demoPublished6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Metropolitan Police has urged the organisers of pro-Palestinian demonstrations to postpone events due to take place on Armistice weekend. Thousands are expected to take part in a march in London on 11 November, the same day some Remembrance events are planned in the capital. Home Secretary Suella Braverman welcomed the Met's statement, which warned of potential disorder. Organisers criticised the force and refused to cancel the march. The Met warned of a ""growing"" risk of violence and disorder fuelled by breakaway groups linked to the protests. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said: ""This is of concern ahead of a significant and busy weekend in the capital. ""Our message to organisers is clear: Please, we ask you to urgently reconsider. It is not appropriate to hold any protests in London this weekend."" A statement from the Met said it had spoken with organisers on Monday from several groups, and that they had ""declined to postpone"" any demonstrations - but this account was disputed by organisers. They said it was ""categorically untrue that the police told us that it was not appropriate"" to go ahead with the march, adding that they are ""deeply concerned"" by the statement. Organisers confirmed they won't postpone the march, and accused the government and ""right wing political groups"" of putting pressure on the police to intervene. The route of the pro-Palestinian march on Saturday runs from Hyde Park to the US Embassy in south London. It does not pass through Whitehall. No large demonstration is planned for Remembrance Sunday. Organisers have previously pointed out the Saturday march is due to begin almost two hours after the national two minutes' silence of commemoration. In the statement released on Monday night, signed by six organising groups including the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, they added: ""The idea that it is acceptable for Israel to keep bombing and killing Palestinians in Gaza including over 4,000 children, but not for people to protest peacefully against these crimes is grotesque."" The Met has so far stopped short of invoking a public order law whereby it can ask the Home Secretary Suella Braverman to ban a demonstration from taking place. Responding to the Met's statement, Ms Braverman said: ""I welcome this statement from the Met Police. The hate marchers need to understand that decent British people have had enough of these displays of thuggish intimidation and extremism."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday: ""To plan protests on Armistice Day is provocative and disrespectful, and there is a clear and present risk that the Cenotaph and other war memorials could be desecrated, something that would be an affront to the British public and the values we stand for."" He added that the police had the government's ""full support in making robust use of all your powers to protect Remembrance activity"", in a letter to Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley. Ms Braverman has previously described pro-Palestinian protests as ""hate marches"". Civil liberties group Liberty said police ""should not be able to pick and choose what people can speak out about on any given day"", adding ""shutting down"" protests would be a ""wildly disproportionate response"". Israeli President Isaac Herzog described the planned march as ""atrocious"". He told TalkTV: ""I call upon all decent human beings to object to the march and ban it, because the symbol of that day is a symbol of victory.""",2023-11-06T21:46:33.000Z

Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia - escaped Gaza via the Rafah crossing on Friday. Mr Yousaf said their return to Scotland was ""really emotional"". ""They are of course delighted that they are here but they are heartbroken that they had to leave family behind in Gaza,"" he told BBC Scotland News. He later told reporters he saw his father-in-law cry for the first time. ""He was really broken by the fact that he had to say goodbye to his mother, to his son, to their grandchildren, as well - the youngest of which is only three months old,"" the first minister said. He said their situation in Gaza had been""incredibly desperate"" and that they had been forced to drink sea water after running out of supplies. ""We continue to watch the situation in Israel-Gaza with a lot of distress,"" the SNP leader told BBC Scotland News. Mr Yousaf reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire - a step which has not been supported by either the UK government or Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. ""This is a pivotal moment, frankly, for the international community,"" Mr Yousaf said. ""You are either on the side of humanity calling for an immediate ceasefire or you are enabling the suffering of 2.2 million men, women and children, the vast majority of whom are innocent."" The first minister also said he was ""beyond angry"" at the UK government seeming to want to ""drive every issue into a culture war"". It came after Home Secretary Suella Braverman described a planned pro-Palestinian event in London on Armistice Day as a ""hate march"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the Met Police had his ""absolute and total backing"" to tackle criminality. Speaking to journalists in Dundee, Mr Yousaf said: ""I understand [the march] is taking place after the minute silence that we will all undoubtedly observe, I hear it's not going anywhere near Whitehall or, indeed, the Cenotaph. ""And, of course, if Armistice was about anything, my goodness, it's about peace."" A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: ""Remembrance Day is a time for national mourning and reflection, with the country united in paying tribute to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for us. ""Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but the home secretary will always back the police to take action to prevent serious disruption and take a zero tolerance approach towards criminality."" The first minister's in-laws, from Dundee, travelled to Gaza early last month to visit Mr El-Nakla's mother, who had a stroke in March but has now recovered. Mr Yousaf's brother-in-law, who is a hospital doctor, and his family remain in Gaza, as do his wife's stepmother and grandmother. Border crossings in and out of Gaza had been closed since 7 October, when Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, attacked Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage. Since then Israel has been carrying out military action in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 10,000 people have died. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Glasgow's Queen Street train station on Monday, following similar demonstrations at Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central on Sunday. A rally was also held at the BBC Scotland headquarters in Glasgow. On Sunday, a silent vigil was held outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to remember those who are being held hostage by Hamas. Heart-shaped balloons were attached to shoes to represent those who were kidnapped.",2023-11-06T21:07:47.000Z

Aylesbury councillor sorry for using phrase relating to Israel-Gaza warPublished6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A councillor has apologised for sharing a social media post containing a controversial phrase relating to the Israel-Gaza war. Raj Khan, a Liberal Democrat councillor in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, shared a post featuring the phrase ""from the river to the sea"". Some argue the phrase implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel. ""I had not known about the controversy. Once I realised what it meant I took it down immediately,"" said Mr Khan. ""As soon as I realised it caused offence, I removed it on all my posts."" Mr Khan had shared a poster of a pro-Palestine march containing the slogan. The march went ahead peacefully in Vale Park, Aylesbury, on Saturday. Mr Khan, who represents Aylesbury North on Buckinghamshire Council and Bedgrove on Aylesbury Town Council, has been a councillor for 26 years. The phrase ""from the river to the sea"" features in a chant heard frequently during pro-Palestine demonstrations and refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean. Home Secretary Suella Braverman previously urged police chiefs to consider interpreting it as an ""expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world"". Israel and most Jewish groups agree. However, this interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself. Speaking to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, Mr Khan said: ""All I believe in is peace for both sides. I value the lives of the Israelis and the Palestinians. I am a peace activist. ""It is not geographical or religious based. I am very worried about what is happening in Palestine, as millions of people are."" On Sunday,the Metropolitan Police ended its relationship with adviser Attiq Malik, who used the phrase in a 2021 speech in Luton. Last week, the Labour Party suspended Andy McDonald as an MP for using the slogan. Follow East of England news onFacebook,InstagramandX. Got a story?

Sheffield Town Hall Israeli flag removal was hate crime say policePublished6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An incident in which an Israeli flag was removed from the roof of Sheffield Town Hall is being treated as a ""hate crime"", police have said. The flag was taken down and replaced with a Palestinian one during a protest on 10 October. South Yorkshire Police said it was investigating the incident as a racially-aggravated public order offence and ""a hate crime"". The force added it had ""carried out a range of different lines of inquiry"". It issued images of two men it wanted to trace as part of the investigation. The decision to fly the Israeli flag was made after a request from central government three days after armed fighters from Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist group by the UK government, crossed from Gaza and killed 1,400 people. Sheffield City Council Leader Tom Hunt, speaking at the the time, said the decision to fly the flag was made before Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes which have killed thousands of people.

"Israel Gaza war: Hamas-run health ministry says Gaza death toll passes 10,000Published6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 10,000 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since Israel started bombing it last month. More than 4,000 of those killed were children, the ministry said. The number surpasses the UN's figure of about 5,400 killed in Gaza in all of Israel's previous conflicts with Hamas since it took control of the territory in 2007. Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed 1,400 people and kidnapped more than 200 others on 7 October. It says it is destroying Hamas infrastructure and killing its fighters so that it will no longer be able to pose a threat to Israel. US President Joe Biden has previously questioned the accuracy of the health ministry's figures, while the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say that ""any information provided by a terrorist organisation should be viewed with caution"". Hamas is a proscribed terror organisation in many countries including the UK and US. However, World Health Organization (WHO) regional emergency director Richard Brennan, based in Cairo, said last week he believed the figures provided by the health ministry were trustworthy. ""We're confident that the information management systems that the ministry of health has put in place over the years stand up to analysis,"" he said, adding ""the data over the years has been quite solid"". On Sunday night, the Israeli military carried out one of its heaviest bombardments of the besieged Gaza Strip, saying on Monday that it had hit 450 targets over the past 24 hours. The Hamas-run health ministry said ""more than 200 martyrs were reported in the overnight massacres"". The director of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City told the BBC that people were using donkeys and their own cars to carry dead bodies, because communications had been cut and they could not reach ambulance services. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) charity said this was the ""third communications blackout"" in Gaza since the war began - and it had lost contact with its teams. Communications were restored on Monday morning, but getting information from Gaza City remains difficult. The Israeli military says its troops have reached the coastline in the south of Gaza City, in effect dividing the territory in two. The heads of all major UN agencies have issued a rare joint statement calling for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", saying ""enough is enough"". ""For almost a month, the world has been watching the unfolding situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory in shock and horror at the spiralling numbers of lives lost and torn apart,"" the UN chiefs wrote. The heads of organisations including Unicef, the WHO and the World Food Programme - as well as charities such as Save the Children - have described the ""horrific"" loss of life on both sides. They have also released a statement to demand the unconditional release of the hostages taken by Hamas during its 7 October attacks. ""However, the horrific killings of even more civilians in Gaza is an outrage, as is cutting off 2.2 million Palestinians from food, water, medicine, electricity and fuel."" The statement added that 88 people working for UNRWA, the agency focused on Palestinian refugees, had been killed since 7 October - representing the highest number of UN fatalities ever recorded in a single conflict. The UN - which is housing many of the 1.5 million displaced Gazans - says 48 of its sites across the Gaza Strip have been damaged since the war broke out. Israel has rejected the idea of a ceasefire - for which its Arab neighbours have also been calling - and for a humanitarian pause, which is the solution favoured by its ally, the United States. At the weekend, Mr Netanyahu said Israel rejected ""a temporary ceasefire that does not include the release of our hostages"" in a TV statement,minutes after a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He said that Israel was ""continuing with all our force"" against Hamas.",2023-11-06T17:29:13.000Z

The writers who reached out across the dividePublished6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"They were the same age and shared a common language. Not Arabic. Not Hebrew. Not English. But something larger than words, a humanity that extended beyond the tongue of any tribe. Ahmed and Yuval. Palestinian and Israeli. Both 29 years old. Soft-spoken and intense, two writers who believed in describing things as they saw them. Ahmed lived behind a wall that confined two million people in the Gaza Strip. His friend Yuval lived on the other side in Jerusalem, the son of a middle-class Jewish family. They were brought together by stories. Yuval read Ahmed's accounts of Palestinian lives in Gaza on another website and reached out to him with an idea. What if he could find Israelis to translate the stories into Hebrew? ""We talked for an hour and it was very, very interesting,"" recalls Yuval. ""And when that hour ended, he told me, 'I never spoke to an Israeli person in my life.' And he said, 'Is it okay if I ask you some questions?'  From the interviewer, I became the interviewee. And we spoke for hours on that first call."" Together they founded Across the Wall on Facebook. The title comes from the 37 miles (59.5km) of border barriers, 7m (23ft) high, separating the Palestinians in Gaza from Israeli territory. All movement in and out of Gaza is controlled by Israel. Ahmed encouraged Palestinian writers to share their work. Around two hundred Israelis volunteered to translate into Hebrew. The posts could draw angry responses from Israelis. As both men tell it, ""blame Hamas for your problems"" was a frequent response. ""We have a bigger responsibility, a responsibility towards our families, our people in Gaza, who need a voice, and who need someone to call for justice for them,"" Ahmed says. The decades long conflict has produced dozens of groups dedicated to creating links between Israelis and Palestinians, from non-governmental organisations campaigning against the construction of settlements on Palestinian land, to womens' groups advocating peace, and organizations forging ties between Palestinian and Israeli children. Through all the years of conflict and political failure there have always been individuals and groups willing to try and stand - metaphorically - in the shoes of others. ""I am someone who hates wars,"" Ahmed says. ""I am someone who passionately and wholeheartedly believes in peace, and peaceful resistance. I will never call for wars."" In 2019 Ahmed was given the opportunity to study in London. From there he continued writing online about Gaza. Then came the moment that triggered a devastating war. On October 7, Hamas attacked Israel killing 1,400 Israelis, the vast majority of them civilians. More than 200 Israelis were kidnapped and are still being held hostage in Gaza. Israeli society was traumatised. Vowing to destroy Hamas, the IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) launched a campaign of relentless airstrikes. A ground offensive would follow. From London, Ahmed monitored the news, thinking constantly of his family, besieged in Gaza. His relatives had gathered together for safety in the same apartment. Two weeks into the war, on 22 October, a missile hit the building killing 21 members of Ahmed's family. He lists the dead; ""My father, two brothers, three sisters, 14 nieces and nephews who are children, who are kids under the age of 13."" His mother had died of cancer three years earlier. All of a sudden he was alone. ""Unless you have experienced what I have, you cannot understand what I am going through,"" he says. ""I would not wish what has happened to me to happen to anybody, not to my worst enemy."" In the photographs taken with his lost family, Ahmed's eyes are bright and happy, particularly with the young nephews and nieces he played games with and to whom he gave treats. These days Ahmed is constantly anxious and restless. He takes pills to try and help him sleep. ""This is my life now,"" he says. When Yuval saw the news about Ahmed's family, at first he struggled to find the words to respond. ""And from that moment, I cried."" Yuval says.""I spent the entire day trying to write him something. I didn't really know what to say. I said how sorry I felt."" Several days passed and Yuval began to wonder if he would ever again hear from his friend. Then came a voice message. It was Ahmed, his voice wracked with grief, but still a friend. He thanked Yuval for being in touch and said he respected him even more now. Ahmed said he was able to differentiate between Yuval and the Israeli pilot who dropped the bomb that killed his family. When I meet Yuval in Jerusalem he is careful not to try and speak for his friend. I want to know if they will work together in the future. ""I think you have to ask him,"" Yuval responds. ""For me, I will. As I said to him, 'I made a commitment to you. I will not stop'."" The stand Yuval takes is not without consequences. He has lost friends because of his advocacy of Palestinian rights. In the current heightened atmosphere of the war he is aware that the threat of violence ""feels much closer than it was a month ago."" When I put the question to Ahmed - will he write for an Israeli audience again? - he is cautious. ""I don't know if I will continue working for Across the Wall or not because right now, I feel a sense of failure. I believe that we failed in Across the Wall… our aim was to prevent these wars from happening, but we have failed. ""So right now, I don't know, how will I convince other Palestinians to write for Israelis after the massacres that they have endured, after the loss of lives and house?"" But then he tells me that he will keep writing. Ahmed cannot be consoled with vague platitudes about peace and understanding. But the work he does with Yuval provides a glimpse of light in a time filled with pain. ""I want us to have a decent human life,"" he says. ""We deserve it.""

Israel-Gaza war: 'I couldn't believe it was possible to kidnap an 85-year-old woman'Published6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"It has been nearly a month since Adva Adar's 85-year-old grandmother was kidnapped by Hamas and hustled across the border into Gaza on a golf cart. She was one of more than 200 people taken from Israel on 7 October, when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip. As the Israeli military continues to pound the territory with air strikes and encircles Gaza City, Adva says she is holding on to hope that the Israeli military is focused on rescuing the hostages. ""If they are doing a ground invasion in Gaza, then they are doing it because this can help bring the hostages back,"" she says over the phone from Israel. ""If I don't believe it, I can't have hope. And if I can't have hope, I have no reason to wake up in the morning. I need to believe she will be back."" Adva had planned to visit her grandmother, Yafa, at the Kibbutz Nir Oz with her family on 7 October to mark the Jewish festival of Sukkot. But at 06:30 that morning, her grandmother wrote in the family chat that she was hiding from rocket fire in her shelter. ""Other members of my family [at the kibbutz] told me that the terrorists were going from house to house. They were burning the houses, shooting and kidnapping people,"" Adva says. After a few hours, she lost contact with her grandmother. But that evening, she was stunned to see a video that Hamas had posted online of Yafa. ""She was on a golf cart with four terrorists around her. I was terrified. I couldn't believe it was even possible to kidnap an 85-year-old woman from her bed. It is unhuman behaviour, beyond possible."" Adva says that her grandmother's health is a huge concern. ""She is ill, she has heart failure, kidney problems, blood pressure. She needs a lot of medication for her system to function, to release the pain she's in. She almost can't walk or sit straight."" ""Every hour that's passing is an hour I don't know if she made it."" Yafa Adar was one of the founding members of Kibbutz Nir Oz and had lived there for 60 years. She worked as a dental assistant, in the library and looked after the children. A mother of three, a grandmother of eight and a great-grandmother seven times over, Yafa is not the only member of the Adar family who was caught up in the deadly Hamas attacks. Her grandson Tamir - Adva's cousin - is missing. He left his wife and two children in the shelter of their family home in Nir Oz and went to protect his community as soon as he heard that Hamas gunmen were in the kibbutz. At 08:00 he called his wife. ""He didn't think that they were going to make it,"" Adva tells me. ""He told her not to open the door to anyone and he said his goodbye."" Tamir has not been heard from since. The family don't know if he was taken to Gaza, murdered or injured. Adva also has a grandfather, an aunt and another cousin, who survived the attacks. Her grandfather, Yoram, ""aged 50 years in a day. When the terrorists couldn't kidnap him, they burnt his house. He inhaled a lot of smoke, he was in a critical condition in the hospital for a few days, but now he is doing better,"" Adva says. ""He is scared of everything. Scared is not an emotion I would have ever used to describe him in the past... He might survive this,"" she says, ""but mentally I don't know for how long."" Adva's aunt Vered had to run for her life after gunmen got into her house, filled it with cooking gas and set it on fire. ""She's OK physically, but they are traumatised in a very severe way,"" Adva says. ""How will they ever feel safe if you can't feel safe in your house? If you don't know you can go to bed and feel safe in your bed. I don't know how you recover from something like this."" Adva says that her family have nothing to go back to. Her aunt left in her pyjamas and her glasses. ""Everything was destroyed and what wasn't destroyed was stolen... And it's so sad, because it was heaven in that kibbutz. It became hell in minutes.""",2023-11-06T16:11:57.000Z

Father appeals for safe passage of children after wife killed in GazaPublished6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Belfast-born man whose wife and other family members were killed in Gaza has said there is no safe passage for his children who remain there. Khalid El-Estal said he was working in Saudi Arabia while his family stayed in the Palestinian territory. His children - four-year-old Ali and one-year-old Sara - are in Gaza with their grandparents. He said he was working to find a way out for them so he can bring them to Belfast. Sinn Féin TD Chris Andrews said he would be raising Mr El-Estal's case with the Irish government. Gaza has been bombed by Israel as part of its conflict with Hamas. Mr El-Estal, 30, returned to Ireland after his wife, Ashwak Jendia, was killed along with his mother, brother, uncle and two cousins. Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas, which is a designated terrorist group according to the UK and the US, killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 10,000 people had been killed in the territory since 7 October. On Monday, Mr El-Estal toldBBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulsterthe killing of his family members was ""the worst nightmare you can ever have"". He said he fears for his children's lives without assistance from the Irish authorities. ""We are hoping for many things, they are working on the documents to take them out,"" he said. ""There are lists for the Rafah crossing border, people who can leave. ""That's one problem, the second problem is I told my father-in-law and my brothers-in-law that I want the children out. ""They were afraid to take them, it is dangerous. ""There is no safe passage, it is not safe."" Mr El-Estal, who is currently in Belfast, said he would like to bring his children here. ""I was growing up here. I have a lot of memories here,"" he added. ""I was all the time telling her [Ashwak] about Belfast. All the time seeing these beautiful views... there's nothing like this in Gaza. It was our dream to be here together."" Mr Andrews said Mr El-Estal was in a ""terrible position"" and it was important that, as an Irish citizen, his children get ""safe passage"" and are reunited with him. ""I think that it is important he has the trauma support, counselling support and I will certainly be looking to raise this, and I know other members of the Dáil (lower house of Irish Parliament) will be looking to do the same with the Tánaiste. ""Ultimately it is about ensuring that there is access out of Gaza for people like Khalid's family and that seems to be the big stumbling block at the moment, there is no movement, there are no Irish citizens being allowed out yet. ""That's what we have to push for and the Tánaiste Micheál Martin and the government have to push for that."" Mr El-Estal was born in Belfast and attended primary school in the Botanic area while his father worked as a lecturer at Queen's University. When he was aged eight, the family relocated to Gaza, where Khalid met his wife, Ashwak Jendia, at university. Asviolence in the regionescalated last month, Mr El-Estal said he urged his wife to move south and stay with his relatives, while he contacted Irish officials to seek help. ""The exact day she [arrived] in my family's place they bombed the place,"" Mr El-Estal said. The bomb killed his mother and brother ""immediately"", he added. He added that his uncle, and his uncle's two daughters - both doctors - were also killed in the blast, and both of Khalid's children were buried in rubble. Ashwak was taken to hospital, eventually dying from her injuries, which included 60% burns to her body, he said. ""It's killing me,"" he said. ""I lost everything, it's not only me, I am better (off) than a lot of people in Gaza,"" Mr El-Estal said. In a previous statement, an Irish Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said more than 8,000 foreign and dual nationals are in Gaza. This includes thousands of dependent children who are entitled to dual citizenship in various countries. However, the spokesperson said evacuations will take some time to complete.",2023-11-06T16:10:36.000Z

Gaza's Christians fear for survival amid Israel-Hamas warPublished6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"During the past month of brutal fighting, every day Pope Francis has been calling the priest and parishioners crammed into Gaza City's Holy Family Church to check on them. He offers prayers and his full sympathy. For George Anton, who is sheltering in the church compound with his wife and three daughters, the contact brings comfort but little hope of protection. ""We trust Pope Francis, but we don't trust others to listen to the voice of peace,"" he says despairingly. ""I don't know how to describe the feeling. It's a very scary thing. You feel you sit waiting for your turn to die. You don't know when and you don't know how or why."" George, who works for the Roman Catholic charity Caritas, tells me he has had to have tough conversations with his daughters aged just eight, 10 and 12. ""I am telling them the whole truth. I say we are with Jesus, but I also tell them that they are in a war,"" he explains. ""Sometimes, I leave them to go to get bread, to bring medicine or clothes, and every time I go, I say, 'Goodbye. If I return back, all's ok. If not, guys, that's it.'"" He says that there is no keeping his girls from the horror of death and destruction. ""This is what they hear from 600 people around them in the church, watching videos on the internet. This is what they see from the bombardment all around. They do not sleep at night because they're terrified. The sound of the rockets is like Hell."" When Israeli forces ordered more than a million residents to move from the northern part of the Gaza Strip to the south, hundreds of thousands did not heed the instruction. Many from the small Christian community, which numbers about 1,000, instead took their families to stay in their churches, thinking they would be safe there, as they have been in previous rounds of fighting between Israel and Palestinian armed factions. After a deadly Israeli air strike hit an outbuilding of the Greek Orthodox Church of St Porphyrius - the site of one of the world's oldest churches - all sense of security was lost. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem described the attack as a ""war crime"". Israel's military said its target had been a nearby Hamas command centre used to launch rockets. Amid scenes of despair, the bodies of those crushed to death were laid out wrapped in white sheets in the church courtyard for a mass funeral on 20 October. Eighteen Christian women, men and children were killed. In the occupied West Bank, churches have held special prayers to show solidarity with everyone suffering in Gaza and remember the dead. Many Gazan Christians have relatives here, although Israel's permit system has made it hard for them to meet up in recent years. At a church in Beit Sahour, Shireen Awwad lights a candle for her aunt who was killed in St Porphyrius. ""I'm really heartbroken. We cannot think, we're paralysed,"" she says. Shireen still has cousins and uncles in Gaza City as well as another aunt, who was injured in the church blast and then endured hip replacement surgery without anaesthesia at Shifa Hospital because of the shortage of medical supplies. She says her relatives are proud natives of Gaza who have stayed there through successive wars. ""Every time we asked them: 'do you want to leave?' They would say, 'no, these are our roots. This is where we were born',"" Shireen says. ""But this time, for the first time, they don't know if they want to stay, that is if they actually survive."" The Christian population of the small coastal strip has a long history. St Porphyrius was a fifth century bishop of Gaza whose tomb lies under the church. Many Christians have moved away, particularly since 2007, when Hamas took full control of Gaza.  Israel, like many other countries, designates the Islamist movement as a terrorist group. Along with Egypt, it imposed a crippling blockade on Gaza after the takeover. Reverend Dr Munther Isaac, a Lutheran pastor in Bethlehem, says that following events in Gaza has left him feeling ""shell-shocked and broken"". He also fears for the future of one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. ""In the first council of Churches, there were representatives of the Church in Gaza,"" he says.  ""We're concerned about every human life but after all is done, one of our biggest concerns is that this long, long tradition of Christian presence in Gaza might come to an end."" While Pope Francis has called for a ceasefire, Palestinian Christians express disappointment in the public comments of other Church leaders concerning the war, particularly the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who is head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the 85 million-strong Anglican Communion. Anglicans in the West Bank accused him of prioritising ""domestic British ecumenical and political considerations"" over recognition of Palestinian rights. In Gaza City, where Israeli shelling last week left the Greek Orthodox Cultural Centre in ruins, George Anton is watching with growing despair. ""We are innocent people. We have no involvement in politics or military activity whatsoever. We are civilians. Why should we be a target? For what?"" he asks. ""We have lost many friends. Some evacuated to [the southern city of] Khan Younis to stay with their relatives and they were all killed. They were hit by a rocket and all the buildings were demolished on their heads. They're all dead, but we have no time to feel sad. ""Every day you hear this person was killed, this family, this home was destroyed, this institution was wiped out. We cannot carry all this."" In the end, he pledges to stay in the church with his family. ""We have had so many calls to evacuate, but we will not leave,"" he tells me. ""This is where we belong. This is our home.""",2023-11-06T13:09:57.000Z

What is Israel's Iron Dome missile system and how does it work?Published6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel says its Iron Dome missile defence system has helped protect the country against rockets fired by the Hamas militant group from Gaza. The Israeli military says that without it, casualties would have been ""far higher"" during the current conflict. However, some incoming rockets have fallen on built-up areas. Iron Dome is designed to protect against incoming short-range weapons. It operates in all weather conditions. It uses radar to track rockets and can differentiate between those that are likely to hit built-up areas and those that are not. Interceptor missiles are only fired at rockets expected to strike populated areas. The system consists of batteries located across Israel, each with three to four launchers that can fire 20 interceptor missiles. There are both fixed and mobile versions of the system. Iron Dome was developed after the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, a militant group based in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah launched thousands of rockets into Israel, causing huge damage and killing dozens of citizens. In response, Israel said it would develop a new missile defence shield. Iron Dome was created by Israeli firms Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries,with some US support. It was specially designed to help combat rudimentary weapons like the rockets fired from Gaza. The system was first used in combat in 2011. Itknocked out a missile fired from the Gaza Strip, which has been under Hamas control since 2007. In 2019, theUS announced it would buy and test some Iron Dome batteries. Israel's military has claimeda success rate of up to 90% for Iron Dome. Hamas said that on the first day of its attackit launched 5,000 rockets, although Israel says it probably launched half that number. The rockets were fired in a short space of time in an attempt to overwhelm Iron Dome. Others have been fired from Lebanon by Hezbollah. TheIsraeli Defense Forces said more than 8,000 rockets have been fired at Israel since 7 October. Some rockets have evaded Iron Dome and fallen on built-up areas causing several deaths and injuries, according to Israeli media. On 27 October, four people were injured whena rocket hit an apartment building in Tel Aviv. However, Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said: ""The number of Israelis killed and wounded would be far higher if it had not been for the Iron Dome system, which has been a life saver as it always is."" The US has said it will reinforce Israel's anti-rocket defence by handing overtwo of the Iron Dome batteries that it operates in Israel. It will also supplya battery of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missiles and batteries of Patriot missiles.",2023-11-06T10:35:59.000Z

Man subjected to antisemitic abuse after pro-Palestinian protestPublished6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Jewish man has said he was the victim of antisemitic abuse after a pro-Palestinian demonstration on Saturday. Duche Sorotzkin told BBC News he was at Trafalgar Square when he was subjected to abuse by a group of men and women who had been to the protest. Two women in the group allegedly ripped his Yarmulke off and attempted to provoke him with it. The Met Police said such abuse was ""absolutely unacceptable"" and it was investigating the incident. Mr Sorotzkin, a Jewish food industry employee from Hackney, found himself in central London on a Saturday eveningafter the protests. He said: ""I was just looking around, sitting, minding my own business, messaging, listening to music, enjoying the sights."" ""As I was walking towards the Tube station [...] a group of thugs, I'm not sure of the number exactly, started shouting at me: 'Palestine, Palestine, Palestine'."" This is when he said two women took the Yarmulke, or skullcap as it is also known, from his head. ""She runs off with it, and all the others find this hysterical, like new levels,"" he said. ""All while the others are still shouting abuse at me, with one of them saying, 'You're killing babies, how are you killing babies?'"" Mr Sorotzkin said it was not the first time he has been subjected to antisemitic abuse but that it had increased since the conflict between Hamas and Israel broke out last month. He said such incidents had become part of the ""daily schedule"" for some Jewish people in London. There has been a rise inreported antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crimessince the conflict broke out. A Met spokesperson said: ""No-one should be subjected to hate because of their faith or race.

Six charged after London pro-Palestinian protestPublished6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Six people have been charged following a pro-Palestinian march in central London on Saturday. In total, 29 people were arrested by the Met Police, on suspicion of public order offences, racially motivated crimes and assaulting a police officer. The force said fireworks were thrown at officers and a pamphlet reported to support Hamas was on sale. Cdr Karen Findlay said the Met would take action ""at every opportunity"" regarding crimes fuelled by hate. ""While the vast majority of people demonstrated peacefully, there were various breakaway groups whose behaviour was completely unacceptable. ""More than 1,300 officers were on duty on Saturday, intervening where necessary to prevent further disruption. Sadly we saw an increase in violence against them, most significantly when four officers were injured when fireworks were thrown in their direction. All bravely carried on in their duties. ""We will continue to be sharper in our response and take action on any placards being carried at protests which are inflammatory and incite racial hatred, or purport to be supporting a proscribed organisation.

Labour: Burnley councillors quit party over Israel-Gaza ceasefire stancePublished6 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A council leader and 10 councillors have quit the Labour Party over Sir Keir Starmer's decision not to push for a ceasefire in Gaza. Burnley Council leader Afrasiab Anwar, who hadcalled for the Labour leader to resign over the issue, is among those to leave the party. In a statement, the councillors said their memberships were ""untenable"". Labour backs the government's stance of calling for Israel to pause its action against Hamas to allow aid into Gaza. A Labour spokesperson said the party fully understood calls for a ceasefire but said one at this juncture would only ""freeze the conflict"" leaving hostages in Gaza, and Hamas capable of carrying out further attacks on Israel. It has seen a number of resignations in councils across England over its stance on Gaza, including in Oxford where the party haslost control of the city council. Israel began its operation in Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others on 7 October. It has carried out thousands of air and artillery strikes, while a ground offensive is ongoing. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 9,700 people have been killed since 7 October. Mr Anwar was joined in resigning by nine other Burnley councillors as well as Lancashire County councillor Usman Arif. They will now sit as independents. Before the resignations, the Labour group held 22 out of 45 seats on Burnley Council. It remains the largest party after Sunday's announcement. In their statement they said: ""We have collectively decided to resign from the Labour Party with immediate effect, feeling that our place within the party is untenable given its present position. ""We cannot remain in a party that is not doing enough whilst innocent people are being killed in Gaza and Israel."" Sobia Malik, who represents Burnley Central East on Lancashire County Councillor, also announced her resignation from the Labour party last week. Labour's leadership is likely to face more pressure on its position as MPs return to Westminster this week. A number of Labour MPs - including shadow ministers - have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir has rejected these calls. Concerns about Sir Keir's position are understood to go up to shadow cabinet level. A Labour spokesperson said everybody wanted to see ""an end to this cycle of violence and suffering"", adding hostages needed to be released and aid needed to get to those in the most need. They added: ""International law must be followed at all times and innocent civilians must be protected."" Sign up for our morning newsletterand get BBC News in your inbox.",2023-11-06T01:05:48.000Z

Few reasons for optimism after Antony Blinken's diplomatic dashPublished5 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"For three days, the US's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, has been dashing around the Middle East, trying to contain a situation that threatens to spin out of control. Israel on Friday. Jordan on Saturday. The West Bank, Iraq and Turkey on Sunday. Every stop posed its own challenges and gave reason to be pessimistic that much progress is being made. The central challenge facing the US secretary of state is that he is trying to find a middle ground where none, at the moment, exists. On Friday, Mr Blinken encouraged Israeli leaders to make temporary pauses in hostilities in order to ease humanitarian aid and encourage hostage releases - a move the Israeli prime minister quickly rejected. The next day, he met representatives of Israel's Arab neighbours. They all called for an immediate ceasefire. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said Israel was committing war crimes. At roughly the same time back in the US, President Joe Biden was asked whether progress was being made toward securing those humanitarian pauses. He gave a thumbs up and replied ""good"". The president's optimism stood in stark contrast to the mood on the ground here in the Middle East. As if to underscore the tension in the region, Mr Blinken's Sunday stops were done under cover of secrecy. He travelled to Ramallah to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in a convoy of armoured SUVs and vans, speeding through streets cordoned off by soldiers from the Palestinian Palace Guard. He arrived in Iraq under cover of darkness. The secretary and his diplomatic entourage donned body armour and helmets for the short helicopter ride from the Baghdad airport to the US embassy, where he then motorcaded to a meeting with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani. On Monday, he will meet Turkish officials - just one day after Turkey's President, Recip Erdogan, recalled his country's ambassador to Israel and said he was done dealing with Mr Netanyahu. ""We have erased him, thrown him out,"" the Turkish leader said. Every time Mr Blinken puts one fire out, another seems to pop up. I asked Mr Blinken at the Baghdad airport if he shared the US president's optimism about the chances of convincing Israel to agree to pauses and in getting the Arabs to accept that a ceasefire is unrealistic at this point. He said yes to both. The Americans are continuing to work with the Israelis to address concerns about the ""specifics and the practicalities"" of how humanitarian pauses could be implemented. As for the Arabs, he said there were differences of opinion on a ceasefire, but everyone he had spoken with believed humanitarian pauses could help win the release of hostages, increase aid distribution in Gaza and expedite getting foreign citizens out of Gaza. ""We've had important progress there in recent days,"" he said, but ""there are also real complications that come along with it."" For the moment, however, no one seems to be buying what Mr Blinken is selling, in part because both the Israelis and the Arab nations are dealing with their own domestic pressures pulling the two sides apart. On Friday, as Mr Blinken stood before press cameras with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in central Tel Aviv, chants and horns could be heard - the sound of Israeli protesters calling for the government to do more to rescue the hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October. ""Our heart goes out to them,"" Mr Herzog said. Meanwhile, in countries across the region - and in Europe and the US - pro-Palestinian protesters have taken to the street en masse. Demonstrators climbed the fence outside the White House in Washington DC and filled the streets in Paris, London and Berlin. In Istanbul, protesters held up a sign that called Mr Blinken ""an accomplice of the massacre"". If a positive spin can be put on Mr Blinken's trip so far, it's that he is speaking with all sides and, for the moment, the conflict has not spread. After Joe Biden's October meeting with Arab leaders in Jordan was abruptly cancelled following the explosion at a Gaza hospital, Mr Blinken's foreign minister gathering on Saturday was an indication of some progress. However, the secretary of state's attempts to encourage his Arab counterparts to start thinking about the long-term future for the Palestinians, and a means to ensure a ""durable"" peace in the region, were less successful. ""How can we even entertain what will happen in Gaza when we do not know what kind of Gaza will be left after this war is done?"" Jordan's Mr Safadi asked. ""Are we going to be talking about a wasteland? Are we going to be talking about a whole population reduced to refugees?"" In a meeting with Jewish community leaders at the White House on 12 October, Joe Biden said he thought that the end result of the tragedy and bloodshed in Israel and Gaza would be a Middle East that was changed for the better. ""But then again, I have been referred to as a congenital optimist,"" the US president added. On the ground here in the region, such optimism has proven to be a rare commodity.",2023-11-05T23:45:09.000Z

British Gaza evacuees have three days to leave EgyptPublished5 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"British people and other foreign nationals who have fled Gaza only have 72 hours - three days - in Egypt before they need to leave. Hundreds of foreign nationals were evacuated from Gaza into Egypt through the Rafah Crossing on Friday. The border was then closed all weekend. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said: ""We remain in contact with British nationals in the region to provide them with the latest information."" It added in a statement that it was ""using all diplomatic channels to press for the crossing to reopen in coordination with our international partners"". Nasser Alshanti, an academic from Manchester, told BBC News his pregnant daughter Yosra is effectively ""stuck"" in Egypt because her husband isn't a British citizen, and are worried they won't be able to leave before the three days are up. Yosra was raised in the UK and moved to Gaza for university in 2015, where she met - and then married - Ibrahim. The couple had lived in central Gaza since then, until they had to flee in the first week of the war when their neighbourhood was bombed. They were evacuated from Gaza into Egypt via the southern border crossing at Rafah at the end of last week, and are now in Cairo. Because Ibrahim is not a British national, they now need to apply for a Family Visa for him before they can travel to the UK. But the 72-hour deadline in Egypt means they are worried about overstaying if they don't get a visa in time. Under current rules, overstaying would mean having to pay a fine, which could be greater the longer they stay. ""I thought they would give him an emergency visa or something, a very quick visa just to evacuate them from Cairo before the end of the 72 hours,"" Dr Alshanti said. A British Family Visa application submitted outside the UK normally takes up to six months to process. The FCDO and Home Office are working together to approve visas for non-British family members of British people who've been evacuated from Gaza, with a sped-up process that they expect to be much quicker than usual. However, it's not yet known how long this will take. Dr Alshanti said that sheltering in Gaza in the last few weeks, and now the stress of being in limbo in Egypt, has taken its toll on his daughter. ""I've just done a video call with her,"" he said. ""You can tell from her face how much weight she's lost. The last time I saw Yosra was in August, which was just three months ago - but she's totally different. You can see how her eyes [are sunken] and her face is quite pale. ""For a heavily pregnant lady, after three weeks in a shelter with a small amount of food and water and no electricity - what do you expect?""",2023-11-05T19:37:50.000Z

Met Police cuts ties with adviser Attiq Malik after chant video emergesPublished5 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Metropolitan Police has ended its relationship with an adviser who was filmed making a pro-Palestinian chant during a speech to a group. Attiq Malik was recorded in 2021 making the speech, ending it with the chant ""from the river to the sea"",the Sunday Telegraph reported. Mr Malik, a lawyer, is the chair of the London Muslim Communities Forum, a body that advises the Met. The BBC has contacted Mr Malik for comment. In a response to the video shared by the newspaper, the force said he had expressed views ""in a way which does not align to the Met's values"". On Sunday morning, after the Telegraph story was published, Mr Malik posted a quote by activist Malcolm X on X, formerly Twitter, which said: ""If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing."" When he was recorded, Mr Malik was addressing a group in Luton following an earlier Israeli offensive in Gaza in May 2021, the Telegraph reported. ""What's going on is global censorship by the Zionists, global censorship to silence us,"" he said in the recording. During consecutive weeks of pro-Palestinian protests in London, the ""from the river to the sea"" chant has been heard frequently. It refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean. Home Secretary Suella Braverman previously urged police chiefs to consider interpreting it as an ""expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world"". Israel and most Jewish groups agree. This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself. A spokesperson for the Met Police said: ""We regularly engage with a whole range of community groups, many of which hold strongly opposing views. ""This instance has highlighted past language and views expressed by Attiq Malik that appear antisemitic and contrary with our values."" The spokesperson added that the force would immediately cease its relationship with Mr Malik while it investigated the matter. However, the spokesperson said the Met would continue its relationship with the London Muslims Community Forum, adding: ""The insights, feedback and reach into communities across London continues to play an important role in our response.""

Humza Yousaf's in-laws who were trapped in Gaza arrive back in ScotlandPublished5 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Humza Yousaf's in-laws have arrived back in Scotland after being trapped for four weeks in Gaza. The family of Scotland's first minister were reunited after they managed to cross into Egypt on Friday. Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia - were allowed to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing. Mr Yousafconfirmed the news on X, formerly Twitter, and posted a photo of the reunion. He said: ""I am pleased to say my in-laws are safe and back home."" The post included some Arabic script, which translates as ""praise be to God"". Some of Mr Yousaf's relatives who do not hold UK passports remain in Gaza. He continued: ""We are, of course, elated, but my father-in-law said, 'My heart is broken in two, and with my mum, son and grandchildren in Gaza.' He then broke down telling me how hard it was saying goodbye to them. ""Our thoughts remain with those who can't leave and are trapped in a war zone. We will continue to raise our voices for peace and to stop the killing of innocent men, women and children in Gaza. ""This has been a traumatic few weeks. I can't begin to tell you the impact it has had on Nadia and our family, particularly my in-laws. I'm sure they will tell their story in time. In the meantime, we ask that their privacy is respected."" The couple travelled to Gaza early last month to visit Mr El-Nakla's mother, who had a stroke in March but has now recovered. Mr Yousaf's brother-in-law, who is a hospital doctor, and his family remain in Gaza, as do his wife's stepmother and grandmother. Mr and Mrs El-Nakla, from Dundee, had spent the past two weeks in a house where 100 people were sheltering, including a child of two months old. They had travelled to the border in an attempt to leave on three previous occasions without success. The BBC understands the couple arrived at Edinburgh airport at about 10:30 on Sunday morning. Border crossings in and out of Gaza had been closed since 7 October, when Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, attacked Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage. Since then Israel has been carrying out military action in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 9,700 people have died. The Palestinian border authority has been issuing lists of those who can present themselves at the crossing with their passports. Friday's list named more than90 British citizens, with 88 on Saturday's list. On Sunday, the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden confirmed more than 100 UK citizens had made it out of Gaza. It was thought there were around 200 British nationals there before war broke out. Up to 500 foreign nationals had been leaving Gaza per day via the Raffah crossing into Egypt since Wednesday but the ""controlled"" evacuations were halted on Saturday. A source has told the BBC they would resume again on Sunday. The evacuations via the border, which is controlled by the Egyptian authorities, have been conducted over ""time-limited periods"". Hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied two of Scotland's biggest railway stations during a day of protests on Saturday. In Edinburgh Waverley station, protesters could be heard chanting ""free Palestine"" and ""ceasefire now"". In Glasgow, supporters held a sit-down protest before marching to the BBC Scotland headquarters for a rally. On Sunday, a silent vigil was held outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to remember those who are being held hostage by Hamas. Heart-shaped balloons were attached to shoes to represent those who were kidnapped.",2023-11-05T17:22:11.000Z

At least 45 killed at Al-Maghazi refugee campPublished5 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 45 people have been killed in what it said was an Israeli air strike at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp. Israel's military says it is looking into whether it was operating in the area at the time. The small camp has been experiencing overcrowding because of people fleeing bombardments further north. Efforts are under way to find those still missing. It is thought more than 100 people were there at the time. The head of Gaza's Al-Aqsa hospital said 52 people were killed in the blast on Saturday night, slightly more than the number given by the health ministry. Residents have been trying to dig with their hands through layers of cement in an attempt to extract those trapped under the rubble. Photojournalist Muhammad Al-Alul lost his wife and four of his five children. He had been reporting elsewhere when the blast happened. ""It did not occur to me that my children might be buried under the rubble,"" he told the BBC. ""I wish I had been with them and been killed with them."" The BBC has asked Israel's military to comment on the incident. While there has been no official response yet, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman told the BBC he was unable to confirm whether the camp was hit by an Israeli air strike. Speaking to BBC World Service's Newshour, Lt Col Peter Lerner added that any strikes taking place in southern Gaza were ""specific intelligence-based strikes, specifically against terrorist elements"". Mr Lerner said that this did not mean that ""there can't unfortunately be deaths"". The Al-Maghazi camp is in the area where Israel advised people in the north of Gaza to evacuate to for safety as they continue their campaign to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its 7 October attacks on Israel. However, air strikes in the south have not stopped. ""There is no safe place in Gaza,"" Muhammad, a civil defence officer who rushed to the scene of Saturday's strike to help, told the BBC. ""They ask the Palestinians to go to the south, but kill them everywhere - on the roads, in schools where people are sheltering, and even in hospitals."" The death toll in Gaza since 7 October is now more than 9,700, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. More than 1,400 people were killed in the attacks by Hamas on Israel and more than 200 people were taken hostage.",2023-11-05T16:15:21.000Z

Rafah crossing: More than 100 Britons leave Gaza but dozens remainPublished5 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"More than 100 British people have left Gaza this week - and it is hoped more will be evacuated on Sunday, the deputy prime minister has told the BBC. Oliver Dowden told Laura Kuenssberg it was ""disappointing"" the Rafah crossing was closed on Saturday. He said the government was ""engaging closely"" with authorities there and hoped it would reopen soon. The Rafah crossing was opened for three days earlier this week, with dozens of Britons named as eligible to leave. The Palestinian border authority has been issuing lists of those who can present themselves at the crossing with their passports. Friday's list named more than 90 British citizens, with 88 on Saturday's list. Before Mr Dowden's comments, it was not clear how many had actually managed to leave. As well as some foreign passport holders and their dependents, some wounded Palestinians were also allowed to leave Gaza via the border crossing and enter Egypt. But on Saturday, hundreds with foreign passports went to the border but were not allowed to cross. Sources from the crossing authorities on the Palestinian side told the BBC that movement of people with foreign passports was not being allowed until there was agreement on the safety of transferring injured patients. There has been no official statement from the authorities as yet. It was thought there were around 200 British nationals in Gaza before war broke out. Mr Dowden said: ""The first thing we are doing is trying to make sure we get the Rafah crossing open again and I'm hopeful we will make progress on that today. ""Secondly, we are seeking to have these temporary pauses to allow humanitarian aid in and to get our people out."" Among Britons who have left arethe in-laws of Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf. Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia, were allowed to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing on Friday. They had been trapped there after war broke out while they were visiting their son and grandchildren. Mr Yousaf, writing on X, said there were mixed feelings. ""We are of course elated, but my father-in-law said 'My heart is broken in two, with my mum, son and grandchildren in Gaza'. He then broke down telling me how hard it was saying goodbye to them."" Mr Dowden urged Britons remaining in Gaza to contact the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office said: ""This continues to be a complex and challenging situation and we are using all diplomatic channels to press for its reopening in coordination with our international partners. ""We remain in contact with British nationals in the region to provide them with the latest information."" Border crossings in and out of Gaza have been closed since 7 October, when Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, attacked Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage. Since then, the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a ""complete siege"" and recently launched a ground assault on the north of Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,400 people have been killed. It is thought14 Britons diedin the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel. Mr Dowden said three Britons remained unaccounted for, but he was unable to say whether or not they had been taken hostage. Abdelkader Hammad, a British transplant surgeon who lives in Liverpool, left through the Rafah crossing on Thursday after being trapped for weeks. He told BBC Breakfast: ""It was a terrifying experience really with all the explosions around us and the shrapnel and the concrete coming down, the glass broke, and the ceiling coming down [...] but this is the picture in Gaza. ""In fact, we were the lucky ones there because we are protected by the UN. But for other people, there isn't shelter."" Dr Hammad added: ""And I can smell, the smell of death really, because there are still a lot of bodies under the rubble."" He later told BBC Radio 5 live: ""I can't stop thinking about my colleagues who I left there and the patients I usually treat in Gaza. ""I think many of them [kidney patients] will die to due to lack of treatment during this period."" Many of those trapped in Gaza and seeking to leave have family in the UK urgently watching the situation. Faras Abuwarda's wife and five children - aged between three and 11 - have been named on a list of those allowed to leave but they are stuck in the north and cannot get to Rafah. Mr Abuwarda, who travelled with his family to see relatives but then returned to London for work, said: ""The situation is a disaster. We are disgusted at the British government as they aren't able to help us. ""What we ask for is safe travel to the border, nothing else, and we're unable to get it."" He is waiting in Cairo, Egypt, and says his children are ""frustrated, hopeless, and feel isolated"". Omar Mofeed, from London, said his brother and pregnant wife, along with their three children, also do not believe it is safe to travel through Gaza. ""The British foreign ministry called us saying Israel has allowed a safe route [...] then people start going, and Israel attacked people who are walking on this safe route,"" he said. The Israeli military has said it does not target civilians. Icel Chumlukh said his wife Lamia, his 13-year-old stepdaughter and the couple's one-year-old son had turned up at the border but were asked to leave. While his wife and son are on the list, his step-daughter is not - but his wife took her anyway, ""hoping for a miracle"". He said his son now ""screams every time he hears a bang, or when someone closes a door"" because they remind him of the sound of airstrikes.

Surgeon who left Gaza urges UK government to do morePublished5 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A surgeon who escaped from the war in Gaza has said the UK government should do more to get British nationals out. Abdelkadar Hammad, who works at Royal Liverpool Hospital, is among 100 UK citizens who have left since Thursday. However, he believes they could have got out of Gaza in the week after war began if there had been ""concerted pressure from our government"". Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said the UK was trying to ensure people could leave ""as rapidly as possible"". Dr Hammad said he was ""very happy"" to have been able to leave the war-torn region but he was also ""sad about the continuing loss of life in Gaza, especially children"". ""I would like to see more efforts to stop all this bloodshed, really, in Gaza."" What is the Rafah crossing? Dr Hammad, who has visited Gaza regularly over the past decade to provide medical support, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I think that the British government and probably all western governments have to make effort and put pressure on the parties there to get the people out. ""I thought we could have been out in the first week of the conflict if there was a concerted pressure from our government to get us out, and they should not have left us with our lives at risk there."" The surgeon arrived in Gaza on 6 October to perform four kidney transplant operations and had been scheduled to leave three days later. However, he had to seek shelter when war broke out following the Hamas attacks in Israel, in which 1,400 people were killed and about 240 hostages taken. Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,700 people have been killed in the Strip amid the Israeli bombardment. ""I can't stop thinking about my colleagues who I left there and the patients I usually treat in Gaza,"" Dr Hammad said. ""I think many of them [kidney patients] will die due to lack of treatment during this period and obviously those people will not be accounted for as victims of the war. ""But the conditions there - especially the medical situation there, which is disastrous - will cause a lot of deaths in this group of patients."" Dr Hammad said many people in Gaza were living ""without sanitation, water and food"". ""People are fighting for bread, for flour… if this continues for any time longer, then I think there will be a breakout of diseases."" His son Salim said it had been a ""stressful four weeks"" for their family. ""Seeing him come out of the airport was just such a relief and it was bittersweet as well, knowing that he was able to come out, because we're lucky to have British passports and to be from England. ""But there are people who were not able to leave and it was bittersweet to think about everything that he's left behind there."" There were thought to be about 200 British nationals in Gaza before war broke out, with more than 100 having got out in the past few days. Mr Dowden told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: ""The first thing we are doing is trying to make sure we get the Rafah crossing open again and I'm hopeful we will make progress on that today.

At Edinburgh and Glasgow rail stations, and at London's Charing Cross, people sat on the floor stopping travellers from catching trains, police said. In London, 29 people were arrested for offences including inciting racial hatred. Two people were arrested on suspicion of breaching the Terrorism Act in connection with the wording on a banner. One man was arrested on suspicion of making antisemitic comments during a speech after he was identified on social media. One person was arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred and three people were arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer. Nine people were arrested for public order offences, including two that were racially aggravated. Ten people were arrested for breaching a dispersal order while other arrests were for possession of an offensive weapon, violent disorder, affray and possession of cannabis. Pro-Palestinian protests have been held in London, and other cities globally, each Saturday since war began last month. One of the protest organisers, Stop the War coalition, said this weekend would see a series of local protests organised in neighbourhoods, town and cities across the UK, rather than a mass rally. In London, local protests took place before many thousands of demonstrators packed into Trafalgar Square for a rally, led by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign. Protesters brought traffic to a temporary standstill in London's Oxford Street with a sit-in. Later the Met reported fireworks were fired into crowds and towards police in Trafalgar Square, leaving four officers injured. Police needed a dispersal order to clear the area. Thousands more gathered in Manchester. Earlier in the northern city, the North West Friends of Israel group held a vigil for the hostages taken in the Hamas attacks on 7 October. Red heart-shaped balloons were attached to each of the hostages' names and photos in Manchester's Exchange Square. Other pro-Palestinian rallies also took place in Belfast, Cardiff, Liverpool and Leeds, with a focus on calling for an immediate ceasefire. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday there would be no temporary ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza until all Israeli hostages were released. In contrast to this weekend's smaller-scale protests, there are plans for a mass rally next Saturday on Armistice Day which have been criticised by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as ""provocative and disrespectful"". He pointed to a risk that war memorials, including the Cenotaph in central London, could be ""desecrated"". Home Secretary Suella Braverman said on X, formerly Twitter, that it was ""entirely unacceptable to desecrate Armistice Day with a hate march through London"". On Remembrance Sunday, which this year falls on 12 November, thousands of servicemen and women usually march past the Cenotaph as senior politicians and royals lay poppy wreaths to remember the fallen. London's Metropolitan Police said it was planning a ""significant"" policing and security operation for next weekend. Both the Met and the march's organisers say the demonstrators have no intention of going near Whitehall, where the Cenotaph is located. Ben Jamal, director of Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said all of their protests had been peaceful and orderly, and to suggest that another one - well away from Whitehall - ""was a disrespect to the war dead was an insult to those marching for peace"". Israel has been bombarding Gaza with prolonged air strikes following the 7 October attacks on southern Israel by Hamas, in which they killed 1,400 people and took more than 200 hostage. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says Israeli air strikes have killed more than 9,000 people. Hamas is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK. Protests in London have been largely peaceful, although 99 people were arrested at the three previous massive weekly marches in London. BBC reporters, who witnessed the demonstrations, said a wide range of people from different backgrounds, including lots of families with children, have attended the marches. Writing in the Times however,Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis said the line between protesters supporting innocent Palestinians and backing Hamas have become ""badly blurred"". ""Those lines have remained blurred in the subsequent demonstrations, in which a minority have proudly displayed their extremism on their banners and in their chants, while the majority stand alongside them,"" he wrote. On Friday, five people were arrested during a pro-Palestinian sit-in at London's King's Cross station after the demonstration was banned. Transport Secretary Mark Harper said he had given an order to allow police to stop the protest.",2023-11-04T22:38:31.000Z

Ukraine war: Zelensky says Israel-Gaza conflict taking focus away from fightingPublished4 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsWar in Ukraine,"The Israel-Gaza war is ""taking away the focus"" from the conflict in Ukraine, the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky has admitted. He said this was ""one of the goals"" of Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. And he denied that fighting in Ukraine had reached a stalemate, despite a recent assessment to this effect by the country's top military general. Ukraine's counter-offensive in the south has so far made little headway. This has prompted fears of war fatigue among Kyiv's Western allies, with suggestions of growing reluctance in some capitals to continue giving Ukraine advanced weapons and funds. In a separate development on Saturday, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov confirmed that Ukrainian soldiers from 128th Mountain Assault Brigade ""Zakarpattia (Transcarpathia)"" were killed, ordering a ""full investigation in what he described as a ""tragedy"". He did not say how many soldiers died in what Ukraine's military said was a Russian missile strike in the southern Zaporizhzhia region on Friday. Reports in Ukrainian media and among Russian military bloggers earlier said more than 20 Ukrainian service personnel were killed during an award ceremony in a village close to the front lines. Ukraine's military also said that on Saturday it successfully hit ""sea and port infrastructure"" of a shipbuilding plant in Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Russia's defence ministry was later quoted by the country's state-run news agencies as saying that 13 out of 15 Ukrainian missiles fired on the plant in the city of Kerch, eastern Crimea, were shot down, but a Russian ship was damaged. Speaking at Saturday's briefing in Kyiv with visiting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Zelensky said: ""It's clear that the war in the Middle East is taking away the focus"" from Ukraine. He said Russia wanted this focus to be ""weakened"", but stressed that ""everything is in our powers"". Mr Zelensky was also asked to comment on this week's assessment by Ukraine's chief military commander Valerii Zaluzhnyi that the war was now moving to a ""positional"" or static stage, and this would benefit Moscow by ""allowing it to rebuild its military power"". ""Everyone is getting tired and there are different opinions,"" Mr Zelensky replied, adding: ""But this is not a stalemate."" He admitted that Russia was ""controlling the skies"" and that Ukraine urgently needed US-made F-16 warplanes and advanced anti-aircraft defences to change the situation. The Ukrainian leader recalled that last year, there had also been a lot of talk about a stalemate on the vast battlefield in Ukraine - but he pointed to Kyiv's subsequent major military victories in the north-eastern Kharkiv region and Kherson in the south. Mr Zelensky also rejected media reports that he was coming under growing pressure to consider negotiations with Russia. ""Today, no-one among EU, US leaders and others - our partners - is putting pressure for us to now sit down to negotiate with Russia, and give away something to it. This will not happen."" Moscow on Thursday also commented on Gen Zaluzhnyi's assessment, with Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman saying the current battlefield situation was not a ""stalemate"". ""All the [war] goals that were set must be achieved,"" Dmitry Peskov said, adding that Ukraine must realise that ""even talking about any prospects for the Kyiv regime's victory on the battlefield is absurd"". President Putin has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine's counter-offensive had failed, while his Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said this week that Kyiv was losing the war despite supplies of new weapons from Nato allies. Meanwhile, the UK defence intelligence said in its latest report on Saturday that Russia ""has likely lost around 200 armoured vehicles during its assaults on the Donbas town of Avdiivka"" in eastern Ukraine. ""It is plausible that Russia has suffered several thousand personnel casualties around the town since the start of October 2023. ""Russia's leadership continues to demonstrate a willingness to accept heavy personnel losses for marginal territorial gains,"" the report said. Moscow has in recent weeks been trying to advance in eastern and north-eastern Ukraine - but Ukraine's military says all the attacks have been rebuffed. The claims by the two warring sides have not been independently verified. Sign up for our morning newsletterand get BBC News in your inbox.",2023-11-04T22:17:04.000Z

"Israel-Gaza war: Ceasefire would allow Hamas to regroup, says BlinkenPublished4 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said an Israeli ceasefire in Gaza would allow Hamas to regroup and carry out further attacks. But he added that Israel had to take ""every possible measure"" to prevent civilian casualties in the enclave. Mr Blinken made the comments on Saturday in Jordan after holding talks with Arab leaders, who want an immediate halt to the fighting. They have accused Israel of committing war crimes. ""We don't accept that it is a self-defence,"" Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said at a news conference with Mr Blinken following the talks, which also involved Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The US continues to support Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas. Mr Safadi described the conflict as a ""raging war that is killing civilians, destroying their homes, their hospitals, their schools, their mosques and their churches."" ""It cannot be justified under any pretext and it will not bring Israel security, it will not bring the region peace."" There have been concerns that the war could draw in other regional actors and lead to the destabilisation of the Middle East. Mr Blinken, who has been calling for humanitarian pauses in the fighting instead of a ceasefire, said that while the US disagreed with Arab leaders on some of the means to achieve a lasting peace in the region, their goal was the same. ""We all understand that we not only have an interest, but a responsibility to do everything we can to chart a better path forward together,"" he said. Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel in surprise attacks on 7 October. More than 200 people were kidnapped and the majority are still thought to be being held as hostages. At least 9,488 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Mr Blinken's trip to Jordan comes a day after he visited Israel to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said there would be no humanitarian pause until all Israeli hostages are released. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) has been focusing its offensive in the northern part of Gaza, following repeated warnings for civilians to leave. As many as 400,000 civilians are still in the area, according to the US special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, David Satterfield. The IDF has also been carrying out strikes in the south and the United Nations has warned no part of Gaza is safe. Mr Blinken spoke on Saturday of the need to dramatically increase the amount of aid that was getting into the enclave through Egypt's Rafah crossing. Only limited deliveries are currently making their way into Gaza, weeks after Israel announced a siege - cutting off supplies of power, food and water. The US Secretary of State has also met Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, to discuss the violence along Lebanon's southern border with Israel, where there has been frequent fighting between members of the Shia Islamist group Hezbollah and the Israeli military. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has so far refrained from calling for an escalation of attacks against Israel, but has left the door open for further action. Mr Blinken will travel to Turkey on Sunday for two days to speak with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the conflict. The visit comes after Ankara recalled its ambassador to Israel and broke contact with Mr Netanyahu in protest against the bloodshed.",2023-11-04T20:10:18.000Z

Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt fails to open for foreignersPublished4 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The exit of foreigners from Gaza via the Rafah border crossing was halted on Saturday in an apparent dispute over evacuating injured patients. Hundreds of foreign citizens have escaped through the crossing into Egypt in the past few days. But on Saturday, no foreign nationals, dual nationals or injured patients were let through, Palestinian sources said. Hundreds of people with foreign passports went to the border, but the gate did not open. Sources from the crossing authorities on the Palestinian side told the BBC that movement of people with foreign passports is not being allowed until there is agreement on the safety of transferring injured patients. There has been no official statement from the authorities as yet. The UK Foreign Office confirmed that British citizens in Gaza had been unable to leave via the Rafah crossing. A spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are disappointed that the Rafah crossing has been temporarily closed today. ""This continues to be a complex and challenging situation and we are using all diplomatic channels to press for its reopening in coordination with our international partners."" The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened on Wednesday to allow a number of civilians to leave Gaza. It was their first opportunity to do so since the war began on 7 October, when Hamas gunmen staged an unprecedented assault on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people. Since then, the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a ""complete siege"" and recently launched a ground assault on the north of Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 9,488 people have been killed. Rafah is the southernmost post of exit from Gaza and borders Egypt's Sinai peninsula. Mohammed Ghalayini, a British scientist from Manchester who had been in Gaza visiting family when the war began, accompanied his uncle to the crossing earlier this week after he was named by Gaza authorities on the list of approved evacuees. ""People are really afraid of what's going on and so if they have a chance to leave, they're trying to leave,"" he told the BBC. ""But getting to the border is a struggle as well, because fuel supplies are short,"" he added. ""So you know, I saw people arriving on a donkey cart with their luggage at the border."" The crossing, which has been open and shut frequently over the years, is now also the only crossing point for humanitarian aid. Israel has not allowed any fuel shipments to enter the Strip since the start of the war. It has also cut off electricity supplies, prompting calls from UN agencies for fuel supplies to be let into Gaza to power basic services. But on Saturday, US special envoy David Satterfield told reporters that when the fuel runs out in Gaza, there is an agreed mechanism to bring more in. On Friday, an ambulance that had been attempting to transport an injured person to the Rafah border crossing was hit outside Gaza City's biggest hospital, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. The agency says 15 people were killed in the incident. The Israeli military said a number of Hamas fighters had been killed and accused Hamas - which is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other powers - of transferring militants and weapons in ambulances, although it has not yet supplied evidence of this.

Pro-Palestinian rally held at US consulate in BelfastPublished4 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"About 6,000 protestors took part in a pro-Palestinian march to the United States consulate in Belfast on Saturday, police have said. It was one of a number ofrallies held across the UK on Saturdaycalling for an end to Israeli attacks in Gaza. A number of pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrations have been held in Belfast in recent weeks. The rally, organised by the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, started outside Queen's University Belfast. Speeches called for a ceasefire, with some speakers urging the US government to end financial support to Israel. The US is Israel's largest military backer,providing about $3.8bn of defence aid a year. Posters displayed were critical of the US government. The march then made its way to the consulate near Stranmillis Road and Danesfort Park in the south of the city. Teddy bears were placed at the consulate's gate to represent children who have been killed in Gaza. Israel has been bombarding Gaza with prolonged air strikes following the 7 October attacks on southern Israel by Hamas, in which the group killed 1,400 people and took more than 200 hostage.

"Planned protest on Armistice Day would be disrespectful, says SunakPublished4 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Rishi Sunak has said that planned  protests on Armistice Day would be ""provocative and disrespectful"". There is a risk war memorials such as the Cenotaph in London could be ""desecrated"", the prime minister added. Organisers of next week's march have insisted they have no plans to be near the Cenotaph on 11 November. Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis said the line between protesters supporting innocent Palestinians and backing Hamas have become ""badly blurred"". Writing in the Times,he said: ""Those lines have remained blurred in the subsequent demonstrations, in which a minority have proudly displayed their extremism on their banners and in their chants, while the majority stand alongside them"". The Met Police is planning a ""significant"" operation and has been in contact with organisers, who said they were ""willing to avoid the Whitehall area"", where the war memorial is located. Pro-Palestinian protests have been held in London, and other cities globally, each Saturday since the Israel-Gaza war began. Mr Sunak said on Friday: ""To plan protests on Armistice Day is provocative and disrespectful, and there is a clear and present risk that the Cenotaph and other war memorials could be desecrated, something that would be an affront to the British public and the values we stand for."" He has also written a letter to Met Police chief Sir Mark Rowley, saying the force has the government's ""full support in making robust use of all your powers to protect Remembrance activity"". He added he was ""deeply concerned that a number of protests are currently planned to disrupt"" acts of remembrance. Sir Mark responded by saying police ""recognise the profound importance of remembrance events"" and are committed to ensuring they ""take place without disruption"". Mr Sunak has asked Home Secretary Suella Braverman to support the police in ""doing everything necessary to protect the sanctity of Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday"". Ms Braverman said there was an ""obvious risk of serious public disorder, violence and damage"" if the protest on 11 November went ahead, describing it as a ""hate march through London"". Several events to mark the end of World War One are typically held across the UK on Armistice Day, which is always on 11 November. This year these include a two-minute silence commemorating the war dead, and the daytime and evening Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall in London, with the latter performance usually attended by members of the Royal Family. On Remembrance Sunday, which this year falls on 12 November, thousands of servicemen and women usually march past the Cenotaph war memorial in central London, where military veterans are joined by senior politicians and members of the Royal Family. The 11 November protest is expected to call for a ceasefire on the Gaza Strip. Organisers said they were aware of the importance of the date, and their previous demonstrations had been peaceful and orderly. Ben Jamal, director of Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said it had ""made clear that we have no intention of marching anywhere near Whitehall out of respect for events taking place at the Cenotaph"". He added the march will begin almost two hours after the silence of commemoration for the war dead. ""Each of the protests we have called have been peaceful, orderly, and attended by hundreds of thousands of demonstrators from a diverse cross section of British society,"" he said, adding that ""to suggest that undertaking protests well away from Whitehall is a disrespect for the war dead is an insult to those marching for peace"". Responding to Mr Sunak's comment about ""disrespectful"" protests, Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of the international campaign group Human Rights Watch, called them ""cynical, culture-war politics and an attack on our democratic freedoms"". The Met said a ""significant policing and security operation"" would be conducted on 11 and 12 November, and that it was ""absolutely committed to ensuring the safety and security of anyone attending commemorative events"". ""We will use all the powers available to us to ensure anyone intent on disrupting it will not succeed,"" a spokesperson said. They added that the police were aware of a ""significant demonstration"" planned for 11 November, but not Remembrance Sunday, and that organisers were ""engaging with our officers and have said they are willing to avoid the Whitehall area, recognising the sensitivities around the date"". On Friday, five people were arrested during a pro-Palestinian sit-in at London's King's Cross station after the demonstration was banned. Transport Secretary Mark Harper said he had given an order to allow police to stop the protest. Israel has been bombarding Gaza with prolonged air strikes following the 7 October attacks on southern Israel by Hamas, in which they killed 1,400 people and took more than 200 hostage. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says Israeli air strikes have killed more than 9,000 people. Hamas is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK. Protests in London have been largely peaceful, although there have been 99 arrests of people who attended the three massive weekly marches in London. BBC reporters who have witnessed the demonstrations have seen a wide range of people from different backgrounds attending, including lots of families with children. On Friday,two women were charged with a terror offenceafter allegedly carrying ""an image displaying a paraglider"" at a pro-Palestinian protest in London, and police are still looking for a third woman. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said it was ""incredibly important"" that demonstrators understood the importance of Remembrance events, telling PA News: ""I'd encourage the organisers to work with the police to stay away from the Cenotaph."" It comes as Met commissioner Sir Mark told the London Assembly thathe was ""deeply concerned""about the impact on community policing after 3,500 officers were redeployed to central London protests in the past three weeks. The Campaign Against Antisemitism has also written an open letter to Sir Mark, after hesaid hate crime laws ""probably need redrawing""as he faced questions about the policing of pro-Palestinian marches. The letter, signed by lawyers, said it is ""quite clearly the case that there are existing laws that are simply not being applied or enforced with sufficient rigour"" by the Met. Ahead of planned protests this coming weekend, the Met said there would be a ""sharper focus"" on potential criminal behaviour, and would be using facial recognition technology to identify known suspects, including potential terrorists. Scotland Yard also said that since 1 October it has received 554 crime reports of antisemitic incidents - in the same period last year the police investigated 44 such reports. The number of reported Islamophobic hate crimes for the same period has reached 220 - up from 70 during the same period last year. So far 133 people have been arrested. Of those, 26 have so far been charged - 14 in relation to alleged antisemitism and six for alleged Islamophobia.

Red Crescent says 15 killed in strike on Gaza ambulance outside Al-Shifa hospitalPublished4 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Palestinian Red Crescent says at least 15 people have been killed in an Israeli strike on an ambulance outside Gaza City's biggest hospital. BBC Verify has verified graphic videos showing badly injured and possibly dead people lying outside the Al-Shifa hospital. The Israeli military has confirmed it struck an ambulance that it says was being used by Hamas operatives. It did not say where the air strike took place. ""An IDF aircraft struck an ambulance that was identified by forces as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell in close proximity to their position in the battle zone,"" it said in a statement. It said a number of Hamas fighters had been killed and accused Hamas of transferring militants and weapons in ambulances, but has not yet supplied evidence of this. ""We emphasise that this area is a battle zone. Civilians in the area are repeatedly called upon to evacuate southwards for their own safety,"" it added. Earlier, the Hamas-run health ministry said 13 people were killed in a blast outside Al-Shifa. In a statement posted on X (formerly Twitter), the Palestinian Red Crescent said ""the deliberate targeting of medical teams constitutes a grave violation of the Geneva Conventions, a war crime"". BBC Verify studied three videos - one of which is very graphic - and established that they were filmed outside the hospital and were uploaded on Friday afternoon. In one video, people were filmed lying in pools of blood in the road next to vehicles - some were severely injured and some were not moving. There is no crater visible in the footage we've seen so far, and no debris or shrapnel visible. There's damage to the front of an ambulance and some cars on the road have smashed windows. In its statement, the Palestinian Red Crescent said the convoy was struck twice on its way to the Al-Shifa hospital - once 1km (0.62 miles) away and a second time outside the hospital gate, where it said it had arrived to unload patients. A Hamas government statement said Israeli forces targeted ""a convoy of ambulances which was transporting the wounded"" from Al-Shifa hospital Gaza City towards Rafah in the south. Egypt's health ministry said just 17 wounded Palestinians were evacuated for treatment in Egyptian hospitals on Friday instead of the 28 originally planned because of the ""events"" at Al-Shifa. The head of the World Health Organization said he was ""utterly shocked"" by the explosion at Al-Shifa. ""We reiterate: patients, health workers, facilities and ambulances must be protected at all times. Always,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X. Bisan Owda, a Palestinian filmmaker, was nearby when the attack happened. ""Some people lost their legs, lost their hands, people were trying to carry injuries,"" she told the BBC. ""People were crying, trying to find each other."" In addition to the patients at Al-Shifa, thousands more people are sheltering from Israeli air strikes there. Ms Owda said many were unable to find space inside the hospital and were sleeping in nearby streets,. The Israeli military says there is a major Hamas headquarters situated underneath the hospital. In a separate incident in Gaza City on Friday, Gaza health officials said several people were killed and wounded in an Israeli strike on a school where hundreds were taking shelter. Israel has not yet commented. Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 240 others. It has also launched a ground operation and on Thursday said its forces had encircled Gaza City. Israel has warned people to move to the south of the Gaza Strip and hundreds of thousands have left Gaza City and northern areas. But many thousands remain in northern Gaza. Continued Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip, where Israel had told Gazans to go, as well as overcrowded conditions there have prompted some Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza, The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since 7 October.",2023-11-04T10:18:46.000Z

Rafah crossing: More Britons leave after nearly 100 listed as eligiblePublished4 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"More British citizens have begun to leave the Gaza Strip, after Palestinian authorities listed nearly 100 as being eligible to cross to Egypt on Friday. The UK section of the Palestinian border authority list names more than 90 people as British nationals. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said ""a number"" of Britons were leaving Gaza, a development he described as ""positive news"". Mr Cleverly did not provide a figure for how many have left. He added the UK ""will continue to work with"" authorities in the region to ensure as many Britons ""as possible"" can leave Gaza. The BBC is aware of at least 19 people named on the list who are unable to leave via the Rafah crossing. Three family groups have said they are located in the north of Gaza but it is too dangerous to travel to the south where the crossing is located. The parents-in-law of Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf,trapped in Gaza since 7 October, have left, but said they were ""severely traumatised"". Among the first to arrive back in the UK was Dr Abdelkader Hammad, a surgeon in Liverpool, who said it was a ""big, big relief"" to walk through the doors at Heathrow on Friday evening and see his family. ""It has been four weeks waiting for this moment really to happen, and, I mean at some stage I wasn't sure this would happen really,"" he said,""but thanks god I am here."" He said whole neighbourhoods in Gaza had been levelled and said you could ""smell death"", with many bodies still under the rubble. Border crossings in and out of Gaza have been closed since 7 October, when Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK, attacked Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage. Since then, the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a ""complete siege"" and recently launched a ground assault on the north of Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed. Mr Cleverly said his office had not been informed of any British nationals killed in Gaza, but that the flow of information was often interrupted, delayed, or contradictory information was received. About 200 British nationals were believed to be in Gaza before war broke out. A small number have already leftGaza after some foreign nationals and injured Palestinian people began to be allowed to go through the crossing into Egypt for the first time from Wednesday. Ibrahim Assalia, a British national who travelled to Gaza with his wife and children three months ago after his father was diagnosed with cancer, was on Friday's list but could not get to Rafah. He said his family is unable to get to the border, as Israeli tanks have cut off the routes to the Rafah crossing and are ""shelling every civilian car that passes through"". Mr Assalia told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme a family of 10 people was killed on Thursday trying to get to the border, adding: ""We don't sleep, the kids cry. We hate every minute."" The Foreign Office has said it does not comment on individual cases, but added it is working at ""every level of government to ensure British nationals can leave"". The Israeli military is yet to respond to the BBC on claims civilians are being fired upon, but has previously said it does not target civilians. The UK section of the list published by Palestinian authorities contains 127 names, with 92 listed as being British nationals. But it is not clear if the others, the vast majority of whom are described as Palestinian, also hold dual citizenship. Humza Yousaf's parents-in-law Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla, who live in Dundee, have made it to Egypt after becoming trapped in Gaza while visiting relatives before the borders closed. In a statement on Friday, the first minister and his wife Nadia confirmed her parents had left and expressed gratitude to people who have helped them, including the Foreign Office crisis team. ""These last four weeks have been a living nightmare for our family, we are so thankful for all of the messages of comfort and prayers that we have received from across the world, and indeed from across the political spectrum in Scotland and the UK,"" they said. Speaking on Friday, security minister Tom Tugendhat said the British government was being ""very cautious"" about giving an exact number of people who will be able to get out because ""we neither control the border, nor do we control what's going on inside Gaza"". ""So what we don't want to do is give false hope or false belief to individuals that they'll be able to cross today,"" he told BBC Breakfast. The UK has deployed a Border Force team in Cairo, as well as consular officials in Arish, near Rafah, to provide support for UK nationals after leaving Gaza. Surgeon Abdelkadar Hammad, who lives in Liverpool, was among those who were able toexit via the Rafah crossing into Egypton Thursday, his family have said. Downing Street previously confirmed that two UK aid workers were among those to make it through Rafah, which is the only Gazan border crossing not controlled by Israel. More on Israel-Gaza war On Thursday, the Foreign Office said more British nationals had managed to pass through the Gaza-Egypt border, but did not confirm how many. A dual UK-US citizen who left Gaza on Thursday with her family has told the BBC an exception was made for her British-Palestinian husband at the border as he was with family on the list of US citizens eligible to leave. Dr Emilee Rauschenberger, an academic who lives in Salford, described the situation at Rafah as chaotic, with many people struggling to make it to the far-south of Gaza without cars or access to other transport. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday there was no system to divide people who were eligible to leave and those not on a list but hoping to cross, creating a stressful situation. After waiting many hours on the Gazan side of the border crossing, the family made it through to Egypt where they were given food and water and seen by medical staff. Dr Rauschenberger said British embassy staff in Egypt told her about 10 British citizens, who she believes work for aid agencies or other international organisations, also crossed on Thursday. The UK government has given both the Israeli and Egyptian authorities a list of British citizens and their dependants, prioritised by their medical vulnerability. Dr Ahmed Abou Foul, who is based in Birmingham, has told the BBC that 16 members of his family who are trying to leave Gaza are on the list, including eight children. He says he has mixed feelings about the news because two young children and their mothers, his sisters-in-law, will not be be able to leave as their names are not on the list. Dr Abou Foul told BBC Breakfast on Friday the family do not know why they have been excluded, as he said they had been given assurances from the Foreign Office.

Israel rebuffs Blinken's call for Gaza humanitarian pausePublished4 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel has rebuffed US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's call for a ""humanitarian pause"" in Gaza. Mr Blinken said he had discussed the idea with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials during their talks in Tel Aviv. But in a TV statement minutes later, Mr Netanyahu said Israel rejected ""a temporary ceasefire that does not include the release of our hostages"". He said that Israel was ""continuing with all our force"" against Hamas. The US diplomatic effort came as Israeli military commanders said their forces had encircled Gaza City and were engaged in a ""complex urban fight"". Israel's offensive - involving air strikes and ground forces - was launched in the aftermath of the attack on 7 October during which Hamas fighters killed 1,400 people in Israel and and took more than 240 hostages. Israel's assault has killed at least 9,200 people in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. In his visit to Tel Aviv, Mr Blinken offered a message of continued US support and sought assurances that Israel would take ""concrete steps"" to protect Palestinian civilians. ""A number of legitimate questions were raised in our discussions today, including how to use any period of pause to maximise the flow of humanitarian assistance, how to connect the pause to the release of hostages, how to ensure that Hamas doesn't use these pauses or arrangements to its own advantage,"" Mr Blinken told a news conference. He noted that more than 100 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the past 24 hours, where none were permitted until recently, but said this was still not enough. Mr Blinken, on his second trip to the region in a month, said the US had provided Israel advice on how to minimise civilian deaths while still trying to ""finish"" Hamas. And he said he had discussed tangible steps on allowing more aid, including fuel, to reach Gaza. But Mr Netanyahu was adamant he would not allow any fuel into the Gaza Strip. He has also rejected all talk of a ceasefire. ""Israel is refusing a temporary truce that doesn't include the release of our hostages,"" the Israeli PM said. The US secretary of state also argued that Israel would only gain security through the creation of a Palestinian state. Reiterating longstanding US policy on a two-state solution, he said: ""Two states for two peoples. Again, that is the only way to ensure lasting security for a Jewish and democratic Israel."" In comments made at a news conference beside the Israeli President Isaac Herzog, Mr Blinken said Israel ""has the right and obligation to defend itself and to ensure the events of 7 October never happen again"". Mr Herzog said Israel was going to great lengths to warn Gazans of airstrikes, as he held up a pamphlet that he said was being dropped in the Strip telling civilians to leave the war zone in the north. As the two men spoke, protesters could be heard shouting on a loudspeaker from a nearby street - families of Israelis who had been taken hostage. Mr Herzog said that his ""heart goes out to them"", while Mr Blinken added that the US was thinking ""every single moment of our hostages"". ""So many, both Israelis, Americans, other nationals - and we're determined to do everything we can to bring them back safely to be with their families and loved ones,"" he added. White House officials later held a conference call with reporters and said Hamas had been blocking foreign nationals from leaving Gaza. Any hope of freeing the hostages would take ""a very significant pause"" in the Israeli offensive, one of the officials said. Illustrating the political pressure Mr Biden faces from the left-wing of his party, one Democratic representative launched a blistering attack on him on Friday. Rashida Tlaib - a Michigan congresswoman who is the only US lawmaker of Palestinian descent - accused the president of having ""supported the genocide of the Palestinian people"" in his refusal to demand a ceasefire. ""Support a ceasefire now or don't count on us in 2024,"" she added, referring to his re-election campaign. The US secretary of state is now in Jordan, which earlier this week recalled its ambassador from Israel. On Saturday, America's top diplomat will meet Arab leaders who have become increasingly outspoken in their criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza.",2023-11-04T00:11:51.000Z

Hezbollah steps back from all-out war on Israel over Gaza - for nowPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The Hezbollah leader took his time to respond to the past month of bloodletting which has turned the Middle East into a tinder box. And when Hassan Nasrallah spoke, what he did not say was as important as what he said. There was no declaration of all-out war on Israel. At least, not now. Few in Lebanon had expected one. Nasrallah knows there is little appetite in this country for another war with its powerful neighbour. The last one was in 2006. Lebanese have troubles enough, with a shattered economy and a bankrupt political system. That is a powerful deterrent, along with the two American aircraft carriers recently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean. Hassan Nasrallah addressed the segregated rally - thousands strong - by video link from an undisclosed location. It was not just his supporters who were hanging on his every word. His speech was required listening in Tel Aviv and in Washington. What Hezbollah does - or does not do - could be crucial now. The Hezbollah leader declared that ""all options are open,"" adding that ""the situation could escalate militarily at any time"". That would depend, he said, on Israel's actions in Gaza, and its approach towards Lebanon. Hezbollah is already stepping up the pressure on Israel with an escalation in cross-border attacks, which has forced the Israeli army to divert troops to the area. But Hamas wants more from its ally. At times, the fiery cleric sounded almost defensive about what his fighters have done so far. ""What's taking place on our front is very important and significant,"" he said. ""Those who claim that Hezbollah should engage swiftly in an all-out war with the enemy might see what is taking place on the border as minimal. But if look objectively, we will find it sizeable."" He said 57 Hezbollah fighters had been killed in recent weeks. Predictably, he left the door open for a further escalation. ""I assure you this will not be the end,"" he said, ""this will not be sufficient."" Hassan Nasrallah insisted that the 7 October attacks by Hamas were a ""100% Palestinian operation"", carried out in great secrecy, concealed even from Hamas's allies. ""It has no relation to any regional or international issues,"" he said, in effect claiming he did not know and neither did Iran. Crowds chanted, ""We are with you Nasrallah"" as they waited under a hot sun at a rally in southern suburbs of Beirut. On a rooftop overlooking the gathering, a masked man kept watch, with a bulky jamming device to block drones. This is Hezbollah heartland, where many are devoted to the Islamist group, which - like Hamas - is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and the US, and many other governments. ""I don't think he [Nasrallah] is going to bring war to the whole country,"" said Fatima, a 17-year-old journalism student with gold rimmed glasses, ""but whatever he decides, I am fine with it. If it is war, I am not afraid. I don't think there is anything better than dying for a good cause.  We are standing with our Palestinian brothers and sisters."" The indications are that Hezbollah plans to leave the war in Gaza to Hamas, for now. But that calculus could change quickly if Hamas comes close to defeat. If Israel achieves a victory in Gaza, the cost could be a much bigger war -  with Hezbollah.",2023-11-03T22:29:01.000Z

"Gaza: 'My wife died in five minutes, she was my life'Published3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","A man who grew up in Belfast has returned to Ireland after his wife and other family members were killed in Gaza. Khalid El-Estal, 30, said he had been working in Saudi Arabia while his family remained in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been bombed by Israel as part of its conflict with Hamas. Mr El-Estal said he had ""lost everything"" but is hoping his two young children can join him in Dublin. ""I want to take them out, I want word from the government. They are Irish,"" he told Irish broadcaster RTÉ on Friday. His children, aged one and four, remain in Gaza with their grandparents, he said. He added he feared for their lives without assistance from the Irish authorities. Mr El-Estal was born in Belfast and attended primary school in the Botanic area while his father worked as a lecturer at Queen's University. When he was aged eight, the family relocated to Gaza, where Khalid met his wife, Ashwak Jendia, at university. ""She was my life,"" he said. Asviolence in the regionescalated last week, Mr El-Estal explained he urged his wife to move south and stay with his relatives, while he contacted Irish officials to seek help. ""The exact day she [arrived] in my family's place they bombed the place,"" Mr El-Estal said. The bomb killed his mother and brother ""immediately"", he added. He continued that his uncle, and his uncle's two daughters - both doctors - were also killed in the blast, and both of Khalid's children were buried in rubble. Ashwak was taken to hospital, eventually dying from her injuries, which included 60% burns to her body, he detailed. ""It's killing me,"" he said. ""I lost everything, it's not only me, I am better than a lot of people in Gaza,"" Mr El-Estal said. Now, he said he cannot bring himself to tell his children that their mother has died. Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 9,000 people had been killed in the Strip since 7 October. In a statement, an Irish Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said more than 8,000 foreign and dual nationals are in Gaza. This includes thousands of dependent children who are entitled to dual citizenship in various countries. However, the spokesperson said evacuations will take some time to complete. ""Time? Time means death. My wife died in five minutes,"" Mr El-Estal told RTÉ.",2023-11-03T22:23:01.000Z

Pentagon acknowledges flying unarmed drones over GazaPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The US has confirmed for the first time that it has been flying unarmed surveillance drones over Gaza. Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder said the drones were operating in ""support of hostage recovery efforts"". ""These UAV flights began after the Oct 7 attack by Hamas on Israel,"" he said in a brief statement. The acknowledgement comes after reporters spotted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) on flight-tracking websites. ""The US is conducting unarmed UAV flights over Gaza, as well as providing advice and assistance to support our Israeli partner as they work on their hostage recovery efforts,"" the Pentagon's statement on Friday said. The confirmation comes after reporters spotted MQ-9 Reapers, usually operated by American special forces, circling Gaza on Flightradar24, a publicly available flight-tracking website. Reaper drones have previously been deployed to conduct airstrikes in Afghanistan, but are primarily used as surveillance aircraft because of their ability to ""loiter"" above an area for more than 20 hours at a time. Unnamed US military officials told theNew York Timesthat the drones were not helping co-ordinate Israeli military action in and around Gaza. Officials told the newspaper that information related to hostage recovery was being passed on to the Israelis. These are not the only remote-controlled American military vehicles operating in the region. On Thursday, the US Navy announced that it had fired lethal munitions from an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) - a speed boat - in the international waters of the Arabian Sea. In a statement, the Navy noted that the test on 23 October was the first time combat munitions had been fired from a USV in the Middle East. The US Navy said the development brings American military capabilities in the region to the ""next level"". Last month, the US Navy said it had shot down multiple drones and rockets fired from Yemen that were appearing to head towards Israel. The US has also sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean, saying that they are there to prevent the war between Hamas and Israel from spreading. In a fiery speech on Friday, the leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah warned the US against using the ships to attack the militant group. ""Your fleets in the Mediterranean do not scare us and will never scare us,"" said Hassan Nasrallah. Sign up for our morning newsletterand get BBC News in your inbox.",2023-11-03T21:48:46.000Z

Humza Yousaf's relief as family cross Gaza border to safetyPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Humza Yousaf said his family was ""highly relieved"" that his in-laws have left Gaza after being trapped in the territory for more than three weeks. The first minister's parents-in-law had been unable to leave following the deadly attacks on Israel by Hamas. Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia - had been visiting relatives. Ms El-Nakla said they were ""completely exhausted"" after entering Egypt through the Rafah crossing. They were among a number of British nationals who have begun to leave the Gaza Strip, after Palestinian authorities listed nearly 100 as being eligible. Mr Yousaf said his family shed tears when they heard the news on Friday. He also recalled the special moment he phoned his 14-year-old daughter on her school break to tell her: ""Granny and Grandad are coming home"". But the first minister admitted the experience of being trapped in a warzone had left the couple ""severely traumatised"" and warned it would take them some time to recover. Mr Yousaf said his wife was ""so happy"" to hear that her parents had crossed over the border. He said: ""You can imagine how many tears have been shed by us just this morning, let alone over the last four weeks. ""But her worry immediately transfers from her mother and father to now her brother, to her granny, to her step mum, to her nephews and niece, and to all those innocent men, women and children who are suffering not a natural disaster but a man-made conflict."" The first minister said his thoughts were with all those affected by the war and renewed his calls for a ceasefire. Mr and Mrs El-Nakla, from Dundee, had spent the past two weeks in a house where 100 people were sheltering, including a child of two months old. They had travelled to the border on three previous occasions without success. Speaking to BBC News from a coach bound for Cairo, Ms El-Nakla said: ""We are completely exhausted as we haven't slept properly for the past 27 days. ""The past few days have been particularly traumatic. ""We don't really know what's been going on in the outside world as there's been no internet, electricity, clean water and food has been difficult to get."" The couple travelled to Gaza early last month to visit Mr El-Naka's mother, who had a stroke in March but has now recovered. They were planning on staying for five weeks but just four days into their trip Hamas launched a deadly assault on Israel. Ms El-Nakla said that leaving her relatives behind had been ""incredibly hard"". Mr Yousaf's wife's brother - a doctor in a Gaza hospital - and his family all remain in Gaza, as do her stepmother and grandmother. They are not UK passport holders and were therefore unable to leave. The Rafah crossing, which offers the only way in and out of Gaza, was opened by Egypt on Wednesday. A list published overnight by the Palestinian Border Authority said those named must be ""present at 07:00 in the outdoor halls of the crossing to facilitate their travel"". Injured Palestinians and 335 foreign passport holders, including some British nationals, were the first to be allowed to cross. A statement from Mr Yousaf and Ms El-Nakla confirmed the couple had made it safely through the crossing on Friday morning. They expressed gratitude to everyone who had assisted the couple, including the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office crisis team. The statement added: ""These last four weeks have been a living nightmare for our family, we are so thankful for all of the messages of comfort and prayers that we have received from across the world, and indeed from across the political spectrum in Scotland and the UK."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""This is great news for Humza Yousaf and his wife Nadia. I'm delighted that their family are safe after weeks of anguish and uncertainty. "" The El-Naklas were among about 200 British nationals believed to have been trapped in Gaza. Routes in and out of the region were closed after Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group in the UK - attacked Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostage. Since then, the Israeli military has launched a massive bombing campaign on Gaza, placed the strip under a ""complete siege"" and launched a ground assault on the north of the territory. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed. Earlier this week Mr Yousaf said he did not know whether his family wasalive or dead in Gaza, as it was under a communications blackout. Ms El-Nakla said her parents had been without clean drinking water and faced ""rapidly diminishing supplies"". Mr Yousafspoke to the BBCof his feelings of ""helplessness and distress"" at not being able to do more to get his family home and shared a video of his mother-in-law describing the conditions they were living under in Gaza.",2023-11-03T18:05:41.000Z

Women charged over paraglider images at pro-Palestinian protestPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Two women have been charged with a terror offence after allegedly carrying ""an image displaying a paraglider"" at a pro-Palestinian protest in London. The Met Police said Heba Alhayek, 29, and Pauline Ankunda, 26, were charged on Friday with inviting support for a proscribed organisation.

London mayor 'worried' about youth radicalisation over Israel-Gaza conflictPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The mayor of London said he is ""really worried"" about young people being radicalised by the Israel-Gaza war. Sadiq Khan said he was concerned about ""another generation having animus [hostility or ill-feeling] in their heart"". He was speaking after attending workshops at County Hall in the capital held by community projects that work to tackle discrimination and extremism. Reports of antisemitic and anti-Muslimhate crimes have recently risen. Mr Khan said he was worried about a ""rise of extremism"" resulting from the hostilities. He told the PA news agency: ""Unfortunately, we have seen since the disturbances in the Middle East with Hamas's outrageous actions in Israel, but also subsequently the actions in Gaza - an increase in hate crime in London. ""We know from previous disturbances in the Middle East that it does lead to an increase in antisemitism in London."" Mr Khan said there had also been a ""massive increase"" in Islamophobia. The mayor said that it was ""incredibly important"" for people to report hate crime, adding that City Hall was investing ""time, effort and resources in tackling hate and intolerance"". Andy Fearn is the co-executive director at Protection Approaches which works to train Londoners to challenge prejudice and extremism. He said: ""What we're seeing at the moment is not only an increase in Islamophobia and antisemitism - there's also fear that comes with that across Jewish and Muslim communities."" He added that Protection Approaches, which has received grants from the Mayor's Shared Endeavour Fund, was working to help young people challenge hateful behaviour in ""safe and meaningful ways"" by becoming ""active bystanders"".

Israel flag defaced on Borehamwood & Elstree Town Council officePublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Police are investigating after an Israeli flag in one of Britain's largest Jewish communities was defaced with red paint. Elstree & Borehamwood Town Council in Hertfordshire put up the flag on its offices on 7 October following Hamas' attack in Israel. The council said it had acted in solidarity with Shoham - its twin town in Israel. Hertsmere MP Oliver Dowden condemned the attack as ""a horrifying act"". Members of the council discovered the stained flag on Thursday morning - the same week that leaflets were put through the door of its offices. ""My first thoughts were for the safety of my staff who work at the town council,"" said council leader Richard Butler. He said that after the two incidents they had ""decided to remove the Israeli flag and leave it off for the time being"". Mr Butler said the incident was reported to the CST (Community Security Trust), which monitors anti-Jewish incidents across the UK, and the police. Hertfordshire Police said it was investigating the incident and reviewing CCTV footage. He said the council recognised ""the concerns people have with what is going on in Israel and the Gaza Strip"" and the ""tensions around that"". ""But at the same time we also want to show unity to our twin town,"" he said. ""We are a council that is open to everyone, but I think we need to be very clear at this point in time - what happened on 7 October was a terrorist act and we will stand by our twin town."" According to 2021 Census, 17% of Hertsmere's population identified themselves as Jewish, more than in any other UK borough. Mr Butler said this was a factor in deciding to twin with a town in Israel and fly the flag from the council offices. ""We have a significant Jewish population and seven Jewish members on our council,"" he said. Mr Butler said he was ""disappointed"" by the ""malicious act"". ""I appreciate everyone has their freedom of speech and so forth, but I would prefer them to use that freedom of speech to challenge the council on why they would fly any particular flags,"" he said.

Canadians stuck in Gaza as other foreigners leavePublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hundreds of Canadians remain trapped in Gaza as foreign nationals from other countries have been able to cross into Egypt. No Canadian was on the latest list published by Gaza border authorities of those approved to leave on Friday. One family said they received a call from Canadian officials to be ready at a moment's notice, but have not yet been informed on when they could leave. Canada has registered about 450 of its citizens who want to leave Gaza. So far, dozens of Americans have been able to leave in the last three days. People from other countries, including Britain, Sri Lanka, Mexico and European nationals have either left or are on the approved list to leave. Dozens of seriously injured Palestinians were also allowed to cross into Egypt since Wednesday. One Canadian has managed to leave Gaza, who was reportedly able to exit ""with a third party"", although the government declined to give details, citing privacy considerations. The BBC understands there are about 7,000 dual nationals in Gaza. In an update on social media late Thursday evening, Canada's foreign affairs minister Melanie Joly said she spoke to her Israeli counterpart, Eli Cohen, and was reassured that Canadians would be able to leave ""in the coming days"". ""My Egyptian counterpart confirmed their cooperation,"" Ms Joly said. ""Global Affairs Canada will communicate the latest information directly with Canadians."" The lists of those allowed to cross is agreed upon between Egypt and Israel, with embassies from the relevant countries being informed in advance to ensure they can prepare to receive their citizens, Western officials have said. In total, Canada has provided authorities in the region with a list of about 450 eligible citizens, permanent residents and family members who want to leave the embattled territory. It is one of the largest contingents of foreign nationals in Gaza, Canadian officials said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was questioned on Thursday on why Canadians had not yet received approval to leave. ""Obviously, the Rafah crossing is an extremely complicated place right now,"" Mr Trudeau said. ""We're pushing on our friends in Israel and our friends in Egypt, working with Americans and others, to make sure that the Canadian families get on the list,"" he said. OneCanadian family in Gaza told the Canadian Press that they received a call from officialson Thursday telling them to gather their documents to prepare to leave, but they were not given a date or time. Mahmoud Nasser said he and his family - including his pregnant wife - were sheltering at a refugee camp, a 20-minute ride away from the Rafah border crossing. ""It's kind of a dilemma for all of us,"" he said. ""We're not sure what to do with this situation."" He was told that a bus would be waiting for Canadians and their families on the Egyptian side once they were allowed to cross. Others say they have received no word yet from Global Affairs Canada. A spokeswoman for a Palestinian Canadian group that met Mr Trudeau this week told the BBC that many are feeling ""very upset and frustrated"" that the Canadian government has been unsuccessful in securing safe passage for its trapped citizen Reem Sultan said that - in contrast to the government's official statements - some Canadian friends and acquaintances of hers in Gaza have not yet been contacted by officials. She said that some families with relatives in Gaza believe they ""are being treated differently"" than Canadian citizens who were evacuated from Tel Aviv in the early stages of the war. According to the Canadian Air Force, more than 1,600 Canadians were flown out of Israel on 19 separate flights by military aircraft, with the last flight taking off on 23 October. ""Now, we're not putting on enough pressure to get our citizens out...many are feeling as though they are not as important,"" she said. ""This is the part that is very confusing and frustrating for families."" Canadians in Gaza have reported that they are facing mounting humanitarian issues, including shortages of fuel, lack of food, and contaminated water amid heavy airstrikes and bombardment from Israeli aircraft and artillery. ""Every minute that passes, people die,"" she said. ""Our families are at risk of dying at any moment."" The group also demanded that Canada call for an immediate ceasefire in the war and a humanitarian corridor to allow food, water and fuel to be shipped into Gaza. Canada, along with the US, the UK, and EU, has stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, instead pushing for a humanitarian ""pause"" in the conflict. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed in the Strip since the beginning of the war. Six Canadians were killed when Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking 242 hostages. At least two Canadians are still reported missing.",2023-11-03T15:48:14.000Z

Palestinian workers return to Gaza after expulsion from IsraelPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Crowds of workers from Gaza have been returning to the Palestinian territory after Israel expelled thousands of them and vowed to refuse any new permits. Gaza is facing constant bombardment and acute shortages of key supplies. The UN voiced its concerns for the workers' safety in the ""incredibly difficult and dangerous situation"". Before the war, more than 18,000 Palestinian workers were allowed to cross from Gaza into Israel and the occupied West Bank. Israel suspects Hamas, which runs Gaza, may have got information about the places it attacked on 7 October from Gazans working on the kibbutzes. Israeli media reports quote intelligence sources who suggest that the layouts of individual homes in these communities - and the proximity of Israeli defences - were among details that might have been passed on. The unprecedented assault on southern Israel by Hamas almost four weeks ago killed more than 1,400 people. The Israeli military says that 242 others were abducted and are being held hostage in Gaza. In the wake of the attack, Israel launched an aerial campaign campaign and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian enclave. The Gazan health ministry, run by Hamas, says more than 9,000 people have been killed. The crossings to Gaza were also closed as Israel stepped up its blockade, which has left Palestinian labourers stranded in Israel for weeks. Announcing the expulsion of workers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu restated his aim to cut all ties with Gaza. A post on X, formerly known as Twitter, from his office went on to say: ""There will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza. Those workers from Gaza who were in Israel on the day of the outbreak of the war will be returned to Gaza."" Israeli officials have not said how many of these people were in Israel on the day Hamas launched its deadly attacks. The jobs held by the Gazans - in sectors like agriculture or construction - commanded salaries up to 10 times what a worker could earn in Gaza, according to the Reuters news agency. Crowds of men were pictured on Friday using the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel into Gaza, which is normally used for goods only. The checkpoint is east of the Rafah border crossing - between Gaza and Egypt - through whicha limited number of people have been able to leave Gaza since Wednesday. Some of those who spoke to Reuters at Kerem Shalom said they had been detained and mistreated by Israeli authorities after the Hamas attacks. The UN's human rights office said it was ""deeply concerned"" that ""at least 4,000 Palestinian workers and hospital patients were detained without sufficient legal basis"" when Israel revoked their work permits after the events of 7 October. The BBC has approached Israeli authorities for comment on the alleged mistreatment of Gazan workers in detention. A UN spokeswoman also said it was ""worrying"" that some Palestinians were being sent back to Gaza ""despite the gravity of the situation there"". She said it was not clear whether some of the affected people even had a home to return to.",2023-11-03T15:30:05.000Z

What is Hezbollah in Lebanon and will it go to war with Israel?Published3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Islamist group Hezbollah, has praised the Hamas attacks on Israel in his first speech about the war. Over the past month, Hezbollah has frequently targeted Israeli armour and military positions from across the border in Lebanon. Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organisation which is politically influential and in control of the most powerful armed force in Lebanon. It was established in the early 1980s by the region's most dominant Shia power, Iran, to oppose Israel. At the time, Israel's forces had occupied southern Lebanon, during the country's civil war. Hezbollah has participated in national elections since 1992 and has become a major political presence. Its armed wing has carried out deadly attacks on Israeli and US forces in Lebanon. When Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah took credit for pushing them out. Since then, Hezbollah has maintained thousands of fighters and a huge missile arsenal in southern Lebanon. It continues to oppose Israel's presence in disputed border areas. It is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League. In 2006, a full-blown war broke out between Hezbollah and Israel, triggered when Hezbollah carried out a deadly cross-border raid. Israeli troops invaded southern Lebanon to try to eliminate the threat from Hezbollah. However, it survived and has since increased its number of fighters and obtained new and better weapons. Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah is a Shia cleric who has led Hezbollah since 1992. He played a key role in turning it into a political, as a well as a military, force. He has close links with Iran and its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. These date from 1981, when Iran's first Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, appointed him his personal representative in Lebanon. Nasrallah has not appeared in public for years, purportedly for fear of being assassinated by Israel. However, he remains revered by Hezbollah, and delivers televised speeches every week. More on Israel-Gaza war Hezbollah is one of the most heavily-armed, non-state military forces in the world. It is funded and equipped by Iran. Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah has claimed that it has 100,000 fighters, although independent estimates vary between 20,000 and 50,000. Many are well trained and battle hardened, andfought in the Syrian civil war. It has an estimated 130,000 rockets and missiles,according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. Most of its arsenal is made up of small, unguided surface-to-surface artillery rockets. But it also thought to have anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel. This is much more sophisticated than what Hamas, in the Gaza Strip, has at its disposal. Since the Hamas attack on 7 October, Hezbollah has been attacking military positions in northern Israel. It has launched rockets at Israeli positions, fired anti-tank missiles at armoured vehicles and attacked military targets with explosive drones. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have retaliated, using air strikes, tank and artillery fire against Hezbollah positions in Lebanon. Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters have been killed, and Israel has evacuated thousands of civilians from the area. IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said its forces were on ""very high alert"" along Israel's northern border. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has promised a response of ""unimaginable"" magnitude if Hezbollah opens a second front in the conflict.",2023-11-03T15:20:16.000Z

Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah makes first speech on Israel-Gaza warPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah, is addressing his followers in his first public comments since the Israel-Hamas war broke out. The speech is likely to indicate the group's next moves, as its fighters and the Israeli army are engaged in intense attacks on the Lebanon-Israel border. This has raised fears the area could become another front in the conflict. So far, however, the violence has largely been contained. Since Hamas carried out the 7 October attacks on Israel, killing more than 1,400 people, Lebanon has been on edge, closely watching Hezbollah. The group has intensified its attacks on Israel, which is retaliating. But both sides have apparently taken steps to avoid a dangerous escalation, and most strikes have been limited to the border area. This, however, could change. Israel is pushing ahead with its ground invasion of Gaza, with the goal of eliminating Hamas, while the number of Palestinians killed in the territory has passed 9,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Hamas, meanwhile, has repeatedly urged its allies to join the fight, and many wonder whether Hezbollah will answer those calls. Hezbollah - which, like Hamas, is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and others - is the largest political and military force in Lebanon. This means the group's decisions reverberate far beyond its support base, and many here and elsewhere are anxiously waiting for Nasrallah's speech - followers and foes. Nasrallah's whereabouts, as ever, remain a mystery. His address will be broadcast in public screenings organised by the group across the country, and is being framed by Hezbollah as a significant moment. They took the unusual step of announcing it five days in advance and, earlier this week, released dramatic short videos featuring Nasrallah, fuelling the expectation of a major announcement. Many in Lebanon still remember the devastating month-long war Hezbollah fought against Israel in 2006, and worry that the group may drag the country into another conflict. One of Hezbollah's aims is the destruction of Israel, which sees the group as a more formidable enemy than Hamas. Hezbollah has a vast arsenal of weapons that includes precision-guided missiles that can strike deep into Israeli territory, and tens of thousands of well-trained, battle-hardened fighters. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has promised a response of ""unimaginable"" magnitude if Hezbollah opens a second front in the conflict. And the US, which reportedly urged Israel to not launch a large-scale attack on the group, has sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean to prevent the spread of the conflict. A full-scale war would be disastrous for Lebanon, and there is little public support for it outside Hezbollah's followers. The country is suffering from years of economic crisis, and political impasse has left it without a properly functioning government. Another scenario - perhaps the most likely, some observers say - is an increase of the group's attacks, signalling a response to Hamas's calls, while keeping the fighting limited to northern Israel. The Biden administration is also, in public and through back-channels, warning Iran against escalating the situation. Iran supports the so-called Axis of Resistance, an alliance that includes Hezbollah - its most important force - as well as militias in Iraq, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, the Houthis in Yemen, and Hamas. It is not clear how much direct influence Tehran has over the groups, but it is unlikely that they take any major decisions without Iran's blessing. On Sunday, the Iranian President, Ebrahim Raisi, said Israel's ""crimes had crossed the red lines, which may force everyone to take action"". Washington, he added, ""asks us to not do anything, but they keep giving widespread support to Israel"". A source close to Hezbollah told me, on condition of anonymity, last week, that Nasrallah - who is known for his angry anti-Israeli and anti-American speeches - was closely monitoring the situation and remained in constant contact with the group's military leadership, despite his public silence. ""Hezbollah is following all details,"" the source said. ""They make calculations all the time."" Sign up for our morning newsletterand get BBC News in your inbox.",2023-11-03T14:21:13.000Z

Councillors call on Starmer to resign over GazaPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Labour councillors have called on Sir Keir Starmer to resign as party leader for refusing to back a Gaza ceasefire. Burnley Council leader Afrasiab Anwar and Asjad Mahmood, who is the leader of Pendle Borough Council, said they were making the call on behalf of Labour councillors in their areas. Mr Anwar said Sir Keir had ""not stood up for Labour values"". Sir Keir said his focus on the Middle East was alleviating suffering, not calls from his own party to resign. Israel began its operation in Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others on 7 October. It has since carried out thousands of air and artillery strikes, with its ground offensive continuing. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 9,000 people have been killed since 7 October. Mr Anwar said he and his colleagues had ""seen the sad loss of people including young children in Palestine"". He said that ""blindly following the position of Rishi Sunak"" was ""not acceptable to us and our residents who we represent"". Mr Mahmood said Mr Starmer had ""failed to listen"" to calls for a ceasefire to ""stop the innocent loss of lives"". He added that he should resign to ""allow someone to lead our party who has compassion and speaks out against injustice and indiscriminate killing of innocent human beings"". There are 22 Labour councillors on Burnley Council and nine on Pendle Borough Council. The calls come after Sobia Malik, who represents Burnley Central East on Lancashire County Councillor, announced her resignation from the Labour party. Ms Malik, who will now stand as an independent councillor, said Mr Starmer's ""profound inability"" to ""demonstrate empathy or compassion, let alone challenge war crimes, has made my membership untenable"". ""I will always love the Labour Party and its values but I cannot reconcile these values with the stance of the current leadership,"" she added. Labour has seen a number of resignations in councils across England over its stance on Gaza, including in Oxford where the party haslost control of the city council. The MP for Middlesbrough Andy McDonald has also beensuspended as a Labour MP,after the party said he had made ""deeply offensive"" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. When asked about calls from Labour council leaders for him to stand down, Sir Keir said: ""My focus is on alleviating the awful suffering of all of those that are caught up in the situation that has developed over the last few weeks. ""Whatever the individual positions of members of my party, that is not my focus."" He insisted a humanitarian pause was the ""only practical way"" to do this. ""To say to a sovereign country when 200 of its civilians are being held hostage that they must give up their right to self-defence, is not for me the correct position,"" he added. ""Anyone who has watched the images in the last two or three days have seen precisely what Hamas is saying about this."" Labour said the party had condemned the actions of Hamas and ""stressed the need to alleviate humanitarian suffering in Gaza"" but that Israel had a right to ""stop Hamas from being able to carry out that sort of terrorist attack ever again"". ""Keir Starmer has been clear that in the long term there can only be a political solution to this crisis which is why we need a two-state solution,"" a spokesperson said. Meanwhile, Conservative councillors in Slough have written an open letter calling for ""an immediate ceasefire"", which is against the government's position.

Bowen: Five new realities after four weeks of Israel-Gaza warPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"One of the first things to understand about the reportage, analysis and commentary that has poured out since the Hamas attacks of 7 October is that no-one has the full story. Not only is it, as ever, hard to penetrate the fog of war to work out what is happening on the battlefield. The new shape of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has not yet emerged. Events are still moving fast. Fears that the war could spread are very real. New realities in the Middle East are out there somewhere, but their shape and the way that they will work depend on the way this war goes for the rest of the year, and probably beyond. Here are a few things that we know, and a few that we do not. The list is not exhaustive. Some people mocked Donald Rumsfeld, US defence secretary at the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he talked of ""unknown unknowns"". But in this part of the world as much as any other, they exist - and when they emerge, they can make a big difference. One certainty is that Israelis support the military campaign to break the power in Gaza of Hamas and its junior partner, Islamic Jihad. Their anger is driven by the shock of the Hamas attacks, the killing of more than 1,400 people and the fact that around 240 hostages are still being held in Gaza. I met Noam Tibon, a retired general in the Israeli army, to hear about how he drove down with his wife to Nahal Oz, a kibbutz on the border with Gaza, after Hamas attacked on 7 October. His mission, which was successful, was to rescue his son, his daughter in law and their two young daughters who were in their safe room, hearing Hamas gunmen roaming around outside. Tibon may be retired but he is a very fit-looking 62-year-old. He ended up armed with an assault rifle and a helmet he had taken from a dead Israeli soldier, leading a group of soldiers he had assembled in the chaos of that day, clearing the kibbutz and saving the lives of his family and many others. The general was an old-school, straight-talking Israeli officer. ""Gaza is going to suffer… no nation will agree that your neighbour will slaughter babies, women or people. Just like you (Britons) crushed your enemy during World War Two. This is what we need to do in Gaza. No mercy."" What, I asked, about innocent Palestinian civilians who are getting killed? ""Unfortunately, it's happening. We live in a tough neighbourhood, and we need to survive… we have to be tough. We have no choice."" A lot of Israelis are echoing his sentiment that Palestinian civilian deaths are unfortunate, but they are being killed because of the actions of Hamas. It is also clear that Israel's assault on Hamas is causing terrible bloodshed. The latest figure for Palestinian deaths from Gaza's health ministry, run by Hamas, has exceeded 9,000 - of whom around 65% are children and women. It is not clear how many of the men who have been killed were civilians or fighting for Hamas or Islamic Jihad. US President Joe Biden and the Israelis do not trust the ministry figures. But in past conflicts, Palestinian casualty statistics have been considered accurate by international organisations. One grim milestone is fast approaching. The United Nations (UN) says around 9,700 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion 21 months ago. Some of the Palestinian dead would have been part of Hamas. But even if that proportion is as high as 10%, which is unlikely, it means that Israel is on course to have killed as many Palestinian civilians in just over a month as Russia has killed in Ukraine since February 2022. (The UN says its data for Ukraine is incomplete and the true number of civilians killed is likely higher, while in Gaza the number of dead is also likely to be higher as many Palestinians are believed to be buried under rubble). The UN human rights office has said that so many civilians have been killed and wounded in Israeli air strikes that it has serious concerns that the attacks are disproportionate and could be war crimes. From the first days after the Hamas attacks, President Biden has supported Israel's decision to use military force to remove Hamas from power. But he has also added the qualification that it needed to be done ""the right way"". He meant that Israel should observe the laws of war that protect civilians. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv. Before he took off, he said: ""When I see a Palestinian child - a boy, a girl - pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child from Israel or anywhere else."" I have reported on all of Israel's wars in the last 30 years. I do not remember a US administration stating so publicly that Israel needs to observe the laws of war. Blinken's visit suggests that he believes Israel is not following Biden's advice. Something else we know for certain is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under great pressure. Unlike Israel's security and military chiefs, he has not accepted any personal responsibility for the catastrophic series of failures that left Israeli border communities virtually undefended on 7 October. Last Sunday, 29 October, he caused uproar when he sent out a tweet blaming the intelligence agencies. Mr Netanyahu deleted the message and apologised. Three Israelis, a former peace negotiator, the ex-head of the Shin Bet (Israel's internal intelligence agency) and a tech entrepreneur, wrote an article in the journal Foreign Affairs saying that Mr Netanyahu should not have any part of the war and whatever follows. The Israeli PM has loyal supporters, but he has lost the confidence of prominent figures in Israel's military and security establishment. Noam Tibon, the retired general who fought his way into kibbutz Nahal Oz to rescue his family, compares Mr Netanyahu to Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who was forced to resign in 1940, and replaced by Winston Churchill. Tibon told me: ""This is the biggest failure in the history of the state of Israel. It was a military failure. It was an intelligence failure. And it was the failure of the government… the one really in charge - and all the blame is on him - is the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu… He is in charge of the biggest failure in the history of Israel."" It is also clear that the old status quo has been smashed. It was unpleasant and dangerous, but it seemed to have a certain grimly-familiar stability. Since the end of the last Palestinian uprising around 2005 a pattern has emerged that Mr Netanyahu believed could be sustained indefinitely. That was a dangerous illusion, for all concerned - Palestinians as well as Israelis. The argument went that the Palestinians were no longer a threat to Israel. Instead, they were a problem to be managed. The tools available include sticks, carrots and the ancient tactic of ""divide and rule"". Mr Netanyahu, who has been prime minister for most of the time since 2009 - after an earlier spell between 1996 and 1999 - has argued consistently that Israel does not have a partner for peace. Potentially, it did. The Palestinian Authority (PA), which is the main rival to Hamas, is a deeply flawed organisation, and many who support it believe its aged President Mahmoud Abbas needs to step aside. But it accepted the idea of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel back in the 1990s. ""Divide and rule"" for Mr Netanyahu meant allowing Hamas to build its power in Gaza at the expense of the PA. While Israel's longest-serving prime minister is always careful about what he says in public, his actions over many years show that he does not want to allow the Palestinians to have an independent state. That would involve giving up land in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which the Israeli right wing believes belongs to the Jews. From time to time, Mr Netanyahu's pronouncements would leak. In 2019, a number of Israeli sources say that he told a group of his Likud members of parliament that if they opposed a Palestinian state they should support schemes to pump money - mostly provided by Qatar - into Gaza. He told them that deepening the division between Hamas in Gaza and the PA in the West Bank would make it impossible to establish a state. It is also clear that Israel, backed by the Americans, will not tolerate a deal that allows Hamas to stay in power. That guarantees a lot more bloodshed. It also raises big questions about what or who replaces them, which so far have not been answered. The conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea has lasted for more than 100 years. One lesson of its long and bloody history is that there will never be a military solution. In the 1990s, the Oslo peace process was established to try to end the conflict by establishing a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem alongside Israel. The last attempt to revive it, after years of on-off negotiations, happened during the Obama administration. It failed a decade ago, and since then the conflict has been allowed to fester. As President Biden and many others have said, the only possible chance for avoiding more wars is to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That will not be possible with the current leaders on either side.  Extremists, both Israeli and Palestinian, would do all they could to scupper the idea, as they have done since the 1990s. Some of them believe they are following the will of God, which makes it impossible to persuade them to accept a secular compromise. But if this war does not deliver enough of a shock to break deeply-held prejudices and to make the idea of two states viable, nothing will. And without a mutually-acceptable way of ending the conflict, more generations of Palestinians and Israelis will be sentenced to more wars.",2023-11-03T12:44:41.000Z

Sheffield City Council to review policy after Israeli flag backlashPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A council has said it would review its policy on town hall flags, but has refused to apologise for hoisting the Israeli flag after a backlash. A protester scaled Sheffield Town Hall last month and replaced the flag with a Palestinian one. The council said the flag was an act of solidarity after Hamas launched an attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip. Leader Tom Hunt said he recognised ""it caused hurt for some people"" but an apology risked causing further hurt. Sheffield City Council flew the Israeli flag days after dozens of Hamas armed fighters crossed into Israel from Gaza in a surprise attack, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 220 hostages. Mr Hunt said the decision was made before Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes, which Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said had so far killed more than 9,000 people. In a video clip shared online, people could be heard shouting ""take it down"" and cheering as the Israeli flag was lowered from the 200ft town hall by a protester. It also prompted a petition, which gathered more than 1,300 signatures, calling on the council to apologise for its actions. The petition was presented to the authority at a meeting of the full council where Mr Hunt responded to it. The leader explained the UK government had asked local authorities to consider flying the Israeli flag on public buildings to show solidarity. He said the flag was flown ""to show solidarity with the victims"" of the Hamas attack and was not about ""taking sides in a decades-long conflict"", according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. He added: ""The decision was taken in good faith and of course, I and others have reflected on it over the last few weeks as the horror of what we have seen in Israel has been replaced by the horror we have seen in Gaza. ""It was right to show solidarity but I recognise that this act of solidarity caused hurt for some people."" Mr Hunt said the council would review its flag protocol and added: ""Flying the flag was not a straightforward decision and it has prompted a range of responses and heartfelt emotions.""

Andy McDonald threatens to sue Tory MP over Hamas claimPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Andy McDonald has threatened a fellow MP with legal action, over a social media post about his speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. He accused Conservative Chris Clarkson of making ""a highly defamatory statement"" about him on X. In his post, Mr Clarkson claimed Mr McDonald had sought ""to justify the murderous actions of Hamas"". But Mr McDonald, who has been suspended as a Labour MP, said his speech had ""called for peace"". Mr Clarkson has been approached for comment. The MP for Middlesbrough was suspended from Labour's parliamentary party earlier this week, pending an investigation, after Labour said he had allegedly made ""deeply offensive"" comments at a demonstration on Saturday. He is sitting as an independent while the party investigation takes place, In his speech Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: ""We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty."" The phrase ""between the river and the sea"", which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestine protests. Critics of the chant, including Israel and most Jewish groups, argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel. This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself. Mr McDonald has previously said his words were intended as ""a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence"". Sharing a video of the speech on X on Sunday, Mr Clarkson, the MP for Heywood and Middleton in Greater Manchester, wrote: ""'Between the River and the Sea' is a deeply sinister antisemitic trope - seeing a Labour MP use it whilst seeking to justify the murderous actions of Hamas should be shocking. Sadly, it's barely surprising."" Mr McDonald said the post was ""highly defamatory and caused serious harm to my reputation"". ""I am not prepared to stand by, while an MP or others peddle the lie that I have sought to justify the actions of Hamas on 7 October 2023, including the awful murder of 1,400 people in Israel,"" he said in a statement. ""Much of what I have said in the last few days about the recent events in Israel and Palestine has been deliberately distorted and misinterpreted."" Mr McDonald said his lawyers had taken ""the first steps in commencing legal proceedings against Mr Clarkson"" by sending him a letter of claim for libel. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Mr McDonald said: ""I beg everybody to look at the words that I've used. Calling for Israelis and Palestinians to live in peaceful liberty together."" He added: ""I would condemn anyone who would call for the destruction and the eradication of the nation state of Israel or indeed a putative and viable Palestinian state - so the words I used are clear. I would never, ever make comments that would cause such hurt."" The MP declined to apologise for using the phrase ""from the river to the sea"", saying he believed his explanation of why he used it would be enough to convince the Labour Party to restore the whip. Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist group by the UK and other governments, killed more than 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 9,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a bombing campaign in response. Mr McDonald's suspension followed days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war. The move provoked a backlash from some on the left of the party, who argued Mr McDonald's words were misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. A growing number of Labour MPs and councillors are calling for the party leadership to back an immediate ceasefire in the region. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire but that this would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Instead he has backed humanitarian pauses to help aid get in to Gaza and allow hostages to get out.",2023-11-03T09:09:46.000Z

Liverpool family's relief as surgeon makes it out of GazaPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A surgeon who was trapped in Gaza for almost a month amid the conflict between Israel and Hamas has managed to leave, his family have said. Dr Abdelkadar Hammad, who lives in Liverpool, was among a number of British nationals who were able to exit via the Rafah crossing into Egypt on Thursday. His family have since spoken of their ""overriding relief"". About 200 British nationals are believed to be in Gaza. Routes in and out of the region have been closed since Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group in the UK - attacked Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostage. Israel has since carried out thousands of air and artillery strikes on Gaza. Mr Hammad was among thousands of people who gathered at the border on Wednesday to try to cross into Egypt. After a long wait, he eventually did so on Thursday. His son Salim told BBC North West Tonight: ""We really didn't dare to hope that he was finally going to get out. ""We finally got the news when he gave us a call and said 'I've made it through'. ""We felt overriding relief."" But many British nationals remain trapped, with Manchester scientist Mohammed Ghalayini among them. Mr Ghalayini, 44, who lives in Manchester, was visiting relatives in Gaza on 7 October. Mr Ghalayini and his family have since had to move several times within Gaza and have sought shelter in Khan Yunis. He told the BBC that he had attempted to cross into Egypt on Wednesday, but was turned away. Saying he had since made the decision to stay, he explained: ""I don't want to leave people behind.

House passes Israel aid bill despite Biden veto threatPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsWar in Ukraine,"The US House of Representatives has passed a $14.3bn (£11.7bn) aid bill to Israel, though Democrats have warned it is dead on arrival in the Senate. The Republican measure was approved by 226-196 with the help of 12 Democrats. Two Republicans voted no. Democratic leaders want a bill that includes funding for Ukraine, but House Republicans opposed bundling Ukraine and Israel aid into the one measure. Senate leader Chuck Schumer slammed the House bill as ""stunningly unserious"". Mr Schumer said the upper chamber of Congress, which his fellow Democrats narrowly control, will not pass it. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has vowed to veto the bill should it ever land on his desk. It was the first major legislative action under the new Republican House Speaker, Mike Johnston. To offset the cost of the aid to Israel, Republicans proposed cutting $14.3bn in funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which collects US taxes. However, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said such cuts to IRS funding would result in less tax revenue, and increase the US deficit by nearly $12.5bn over the next decade. ""My Republican friends say they want to help Israel,"" said Democratic congressman Jim McGovern of Massachusetts. ""And so, what do they do? They condition the aid to Israel on essentially a tax break for millionaires and billionaires and corporations that cheat on their taxes."" Senate Democrats plan instead to work on a bipartisan package that includes aid for both Israel and Ukraine along with humanitarian aid for Gaza. Support for continued assistance to Ukraine is steadfast among Democrats and many Senate Republicans, who say it is essential as the country fights Russia. Mr Johnson, the House Speaker, said he intends to propose a separate package for Ukraine that will be combined with funding for security at the US-Mexico border. ""Ukraine will come in short order. It will come next,"" he told reporters on Thursday. Mr Johnson said House Republicans were ""trying to get back to the principle of fiscal responsibility"". The two Republicans to vote against the bill were ultraconservatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. ""We can't afford more foreign aid,"" Mr Massie posted on X. ""I voted against the billions for Ukraine, and I am voting against $14+ billion of foreign aid for Israel tonight."" The US has approved $113bn in military, humanitarian and economic aid for Ukraine since its war with Russia began.",2023-11-03T01:33:07.000Z

"A doctor, tailor, and bride-to-be: Stories of those killed in GazaPublished3 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The death toll in Gaza is rising as Israel presses on with its war against Hamas, following the attacks on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed in Israel. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed since the war began. Because of safety concerns, there are relatively few journalists in Gaza to document the human cost of the fighting. But the BBC has been speaking to a number of families and eyewitnesses who have told us stories of loved ones who have been killed in recent days. With serious power supply issues in the Gaza Strip, Yusof and his two older siblings - sister Jury, 13, and nine-year-old brother Hamed - felt quite lucky. Their father, Mohamed Abu Musa, a radiographer at the Nasser hospital in the city of Khan Younis, had installed solar panels at their house, so the children could watch their favourite cartoons on TV. They were settling down in front of the television on 15 October when, their father says, their home was hit by an Israeli air strike. Jury and Hamed somehow survived, but Yusof was killed when the roof of their house collapsed. He was seven years old. Mohamed was working a 24-hour shift at the hospital when his wife, Rawan, entered, screaming in search for their youngest son. She had been able to find Hamed, while rescue teams helped pull Jury out of the rubble. Jury had suffered head injuries but her parents say she is ""improving"". A video showing Rawan asking at the hospital for her ""handsome and curly-haired son"" circulated widely on social media. But Mohamed would later find his son's body in the hospital morgue. ""The last time I saw Yusof alive was when he ran to hug me on the doorstep of our home, just before I left for work,"" Mohamed recalls. ""He kissed me and said goodbye after I had given him some biscuits and bananas. He wanted to be a doctor, maybe because he always saw me going to hospital for work."" On the evening of 15 October, Dr Saidam needed a rest. The 47-year-old surgeon had not left the al-Shifa hospital, in Gaza City for more than week. He told his colleagues he was going home for the night. But a few hours later he was killed in a strike at his home. ""This calm, funny and kind-hearted man came back to the hospital the next morning, but as a lifeless body,"" his colleague Dr Adnan Albursh explained. Dr Albursh, who had known the surgeon for more than 20 years, added that his late colleague had been nicknamed ""the relentless surgeon"" by his peers for his dedication to the job. A veteran of the operating room, Dr Saidam was also known as a great mentor to younger doctors. ""If any of the doctors faced any difficulties, they knew Dr Saidam was the one who would sort it out,"" agreed Dr Ahmed El Mokhallalati, the head of the plastic surgery department at al-Shifa Hospital. ""His death is a huge loss not only to this hospital but also to the medical profession,"" he added. Seventeen-year-old student Nour was killed on 11 October when an Israeli air strike hit her family home in the town of Deir al-Balah, 14km south of Gaza City, according to her uncle. Mohammed al-Kharma said his niece wanted to relocate because of the bombing and stay with relatives elsewhere. ""Her father asked her to stay in her house, which was bombed the very next morning. It was her fate,"" he said. Nour was killed alongside her nephew Yazan. The pair had been playing in the living room. Her elder sisters, Ola, and Huda, who were preparing breakfast with their mother, Jamalat, survived. Nour was in her last year of high school and always wanted to be a doctor. Her uncle said his family pulled her school bag from under the rubble. It contained books and a diary, and in one of the pages she had written: ""I want to make my family proud of me and I will get high grades by the will of Allah."" In her last communication with her fiance Khaled al-Masry, Lurin said she was exhausted from moving from place to place in search of safety from the war. The 30-year-old had just arrived at the Nusairat refugee camp, in the centre of the Gaza Strip, to stay with her aunt. Lurin had survived two strikes, including one on 16 October that flattened the building where she lived with her parents in Gaza City. ""She told me she was going to have a shower, pray and rest,"" Khaled recalls. According to her fiance, who lives and works in Cyprus, she was praying in a room when the house she was in was hit. ""She was killed while she was praying,"" he says. Lurin and Khaled had postponed their wedding a couple of times due to the unstable situation in Gaza. They were planning finally to get married in December and move to Cyprus. A devastated Khaled said: ""She is now resting forever. She used to wear a white dress, but now is wearing a white shroud."" People in Gaza City's Radwan district who needed women's formal clothing would head straight to Fekriya Hassan Abdul A'al's place. ""I remember when we used to have our house full of brides-to-be and bridesmaids who would come to my mother's place to have a fitting. She was exceptionally talented,"" Fekriya's daughter Nevine says. The 65-year-old tailor was killed along with two of her siblings, two of her children and two of her grandchildren, after the house they were sheltering in was hit by an air strike on 23 October. Nevine, who was taking cover at a friend's house, says that Fekriya was devoted to her family and would host large weekly gatherings. But Nevine says her mood had been severely affected by the escalation in the conflict: ""She told me in our last phone call: 'I'm very depressed and exhausted from what seems to be an endless war'."" Brothers Mazen, 17 and Ahmed, 13 were among those killed by the explosion at the al-Ahli Hospital on 17 October. Palestinian officials say the blast was caused by an Israeli air strike. But the Israeli military say it was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad - an accusation the group rejected. Arafat Abu Massi, the father of Mazen and Ahmed, said the two brothers were ""very close to each other"" but had very different personalities. Arafat and his wife had undergone IVF therapy for eight years to have Mazen, who was at high school and wanted to become a dentist. ""He was the brightest of all my children,"" he says. While Ahmed was described by his father as ""the strongest and bravest in the family"" - and the entrepreneurial one. ""He used to sell toys and school supplies in a small booth near our house,"" Arafat said. His only remaining child now is three-year-old Faraj, who, according to Arafat, keeps crying and asking where his siblings are. ""I told him that God has chosen them to stay in heaven. That is a better place for my two young smart gentlemen."" Salam Mema, a 32-year-old Palestinian journalist, was killed on 10 October when her house in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, was hit by an Israeli air strike, her friend told the BBC. Her husband, their two-year-old daughter Sham, their seven-year-old son Hadi, and other members of the family, were also killed, leaving their five-year-old son Ali as the sole survivor. As of 31 October, Salam was one of 31 journalists confirmed killed on both sides, since the Israel-Hamas conflict began. The 26-year-old pharmacist was killed in an air strike in the southern city of Rafah, on 17 October. She was sleeping beside her three-month-old baby girl Elyana, and her husband. Safaa's uncle and a retired medical doctor based in the UK, Omar Hassouna, said her parents managed to survive the strike but are in shock and devastated by her death. Omar said the last time he saw his niece was in January, during his holiday in Gaza. ""Safaa was polite, helpful, and loved by everyone. ""I have lost a lovely niece. Her death is unfair, as all the deaths of all of the civilians in Gaza have been."" ""I would prefer to be in Gaza with them right now, I feel so hopeless here.""",2023-11-03T00:31:06.000Z

Palestinian-American couple and baby boy finally escape GazaPublished2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Palestinian-American family has managed to flee Gaza after nearly a month trapped in the war-torn enclave. Abood Okal, Wafaa Abuzayda and their one-year-old son, Yousef, crossed safely into Egypt through the Rafah crossing on Thursday morning, a family friend told the BBC. The trio were among a list of 400 US citizens and 100 others approved by border authorities to leave Gaza. But several hundred more foreign nationals remain inside the enclave. For the Okals, who reside in the quiet Boston suburb of Medway, Massachusetts, the war shattered a joyful reunion with the grandparents Yousef had never met. After flying into Tel Aviv last month, they took in the sights of Jerusalem, journeyed through the West Bank, went to the beach, shared meals and rode horses together. Then, six days before they were to catch a flight back to Boston, Hamas launched its attack on Israel, which responded by bombarding Gaza. Heeding Israel's warnings to flee south, the Okals left Ms Abuzayda's parents' home in Jabalia, in northern Gaza. They do not know if the house - which is in the vicinity of a refugee camp that was bombed on Tuesday - remains intact. By the following weekend, they had made their way to Rafah and holed up in a house about five minutes from the border crossing into Egypt. ""The general understanding was that, if there was going to be any opportunity for American citizens to get out, it was going to be through Egypt,"" Sammy Nabulsi, a family friend, said. According to Mr Nabulsi, over the past three weeks Mr Okal attempted to make daily contact with the US state department and the American embassies in Cairo and Jerusalem. On four separate occasions, they were advised to go to the Rafah crossing, waiting in line for up to eight hours but never receiving permission to cross. Mr Nabulsi, who told the BBC he spoke with the family nearly every day of their ordeal. A real estate lawyer by trade, he said he contacted White House and state department officials, as well as several members of the US Congress, on the Okals' behalf. But, he told the BBC, officials offered vague and shifting explanations for why his friends were unable to get out. It was an experience that left him concerned the government was not prioritising rescuing its citizens from Gaza, and left the Okals feeling ""completely hopeless and abandoned"". All the while, the family's circumstances were growing more dire with each passing day. The house in Rafah where they were staying was a single-family unit, but they shared it with 40 others. With no running water or fuel, the residents were limiting how often they flushed the toilets and drinking saltwater from the well to stay hydrated. With no cooking oil on hand, the family was largely living off canned tuna and fava beans, according to Mr Nabulsi. Their last visit to the bakery lasted six hours and their last water run yielded only a few litres for the whole house to share. But the hardest part for Mr Okal and Ms Abuzayda was watching how the conditions were affecting their son, said Mr Nabulsi. When the war broke out, Yousef had occasionally woken up startled by the sound of airstrikes. But more recently, he had begun to wake up screaming, apparently from night terrors, even when it was quiet outside. Oftentimes, he was inconsolable and would not go back to sleep. ""In the early days, every time there was an airstrike, [his mum] would try to smile and clap to convince him it was just fireworks,"" Mr Nabulsi said. A few days ago, he added, they had run out of milk and were unable to find any more. Mr Nabulsi says Mr Okal is a research director at the Bristol Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company, and that Ms Abuzayda worked at a Boston non-profit for young adults. On Thursday, the family's names appeared on a list published by Gaza's border authority with permission to enter Egypt. Mr Nabulsi confirmed to the BBC the trio crossed into Egypt shortly after 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) and was being transported to Cairo by US consular affairs officials. ""The Okal family is overwhelmed with the love and support they have received from home and abroad, but they are also exhausted, physically and emotionally drained, and have a long journey ahead of them back to the United States,"" he said in a statement. The family, he added, is asking for privacy and the safe departure of all remaining Americans, as well as ""compassion and prayers for the innocent civilians in Gaza, who gave them shelter, who helped them find food and water, but who continue to be without their own supply of food, water, fuel, or medicine to live"".",2023-11-02T23:05:35.000Z

"When they called their mother, Hamas answered the phonePublished2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Nearly four weeks have passed since Hamas kidnapped about 240 people into Gaza - among them is 84-year-old Ditza Heiman. When Ditza's daughter called her on 7 October, Hamas answered the phone. ""They were shouting 'It's Hamas, it's Hamas',"" another daughter, Neta Heiman Mina, told the BBC. ""My sister was terrified, she hung up. I didn't think they had taken her. I thought they had killed her."" Ditza Heiman is being held hostage in Gaza. She was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz when Hamas staged its deadly attack on Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostage. Neta says she was in touch with her mother in the morning. Ditza was in her safe room and didn't know what was happening outside. ""I don't think she realised, or we realised, that the terrorists were at the kibbutz,"" Neta said. The last message she got from her mother was a few minutes before 10:00 local time. After that she didn't answer her phone. Neta later spoke to one of her mother's neighbours, who told her that Ditza had been calling for help. He went out to see what was happening and saw her being taken away by Hamas gunmen. ""There were too many terrorists outside, they started shooting. He crawled back into his shelter. He was lucky,"" Neta said. On a Hamas Facebook page, Neta and her sister found a video that showed her mother. ""They took her. They put her in a car. When we found the video, we knew she was alive."" Ditza Heiman had lived all her adult life in Nir Oz. A social worker who had only stopped working a few years ago, she has 12 grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and ""so many more children who grew up with her and consider her to be family"". Neta's voice is unwavering as she talks about her mother. She lived on her own, she cooked for herself, she walked places. ""But she walked slowly. I don't think she could walk for many kilometres, like Yocheved,"" Neta said, referring to 85-year-old Yocheved Lifschitz who was freed last month and who has spoken of having to walk in the tunnels. Ms Lifschitz described being taken into a ""spider's web"" of tunnels underneath Gaza. Neta is very worried about the ground offensive in Gaza. She doesn't know what it means for the hostages, and she is also concerned for the young soldiers. ""They are all friends of my children, they are children of my friends. I don't think it will bring the hostages back,"" she said. She wants Israel's government to ""talk directly to Hamas"". A long-time activist with Women Wage Peace, the largest Israeli grassroots peace movement made up of Jewish and Arab women, she has long campaigned for an agreement-based resolution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. She also blames Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for what has happened. ""In the last nine months they did everything to escalate the situation, especially in the West Bank,"" she said. She says that Hamas attacked at a time when many Israeli troops had been stationed in the occupied West Bank. ""The army was there [in the West Bank], to protect the Sukkah [a shelter put up as part of a Jewish festival]."" she says, referring to tensions in the flashpoint town of Huwara. ""They were there and they didn't protect my mother. And now they need to do everything to bring them [the hostages] back.""",2023-11-02T20:46:59.000Z

Israel says Hamas stages hit-and-run attacks from tunnelsPublished2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli forces have encircled the Hamas stronghold of Gaza City, Israel's military says, as it continues its assault on the Gaza Strip. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said soldiers were engaged in close quarters combat with Hamas fighters staging hit-and-run attacks from tunnels. The UN said four of its schools being used as shelters had been damaged and warned water shortages were worsening. The Hamas-run health ministry says over 9,000 Palestinians have been killed. On Thursday the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said four of its schools being used as shelters had been damaged in less than 24 hours. At least 20 people were reportedly killed at a school in the Jabalia refugee camp, UNRWA said, while a child was reportedly killed at a school-turned-shelter in the Beach refugee camp. The BBC has verified two videos from the schools. One extremely graphic video, filmed at an elementary school in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, shows the aftermath, first outside the main gate of the school and then in the main courtyard. At least 20 people, either dead or injured, can be seen on the ground, including men, women and children. The second video, filmed at the main courtyard of a primary school in Beach refugee camp, also in northern Gaza but near the Mediterranean coast, shows a plume of smoke rising from behind the main building of the school. Several people, including children, run for safety in the courtyard, while some residents of the camp watch from the windows above. A series of explosions can be heard in the background of the video. The last one, the loudest, causes the crowd in the courtyard to flee in panic. Hamas authorities in Gaza blamed Israeli air strikes. The IDF has not yet commented. UN-appointed experts have called for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, saying time was running out for Palestinian people there who find themselves at ""grave risk of genocide"". ""The situation in Gaza has reached a catastrophic tipping point,"" they said, warning that a ban on fuel entering Gaza and disruption to water supplies meant people had little access to safe drinking water. ""Water is essential to human life and today, two million Gazans are struggling to find drinking water,"" they said. The Israeli mission to the UN in Geneva called the comments ""deplorable and deeply concerning"" and blamed Hamas for civilian deaths. Earlier on Thursday the IDF said it had killed about 130 Hamas fighters. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said troops were at ""the height of battle"". ""We've had impressive successes and have passed the outskirts of Gaza City. We are advancing,"" he said in a statement. A number of foreign nationals were able to leave Gaza after the Rafah crossing with Egypt opened for a second day. President Biden says more than 70 Americans were among them. But medical aid organisation Doctors Without Borders says more than 20,000 wounded people remained trapped in the territory. Meanwhile, the Lebanese movement Hezbollah said it had attacked 19 targets in Israel simultaneously, in what would be its most intense assault on Israel so far. The Israeli military said it was striking a series of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in response. It comes a day before a much-anticipated speech by the leader of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, his first public address since the conflict broke out last month.",2023-11-02T19:35:48.000Z

German vice-chancellor Habeck hits out against rising antisemitismPublished2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"German Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck has vowed a tough political response to increasing antisemitism. In a video seen eight million times, he criticised antisemitism from Islamists, the far right and ""parts of the political left"". Germany has seen a recent surge in antisemitic and anti-Israel incidents. They began after the 7 October attacks in Israel during which Palestinian Hamas militants killed 1,400 Israelis and took more than 230 hostages. Israel then launched a war it says is aimed at destroying Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 9,000 people have since been killed. Mr Habeck's lengthy and emotive video has had a big impact in Germany.He pointed out that almost 80 years after the Holocaust, Jewish communities were having to tell their members to steer clear of certain places. Some political figures praised him for giving what sounded like a state of the nation address. Antisemitism commissioner Felix Klein said he had made a clear and prudent appeal to the responsibility of everyone in Germany to stand up for the safety of Jewish women and men. Germany has outlawed the burning of other countries' flags and the vice-chancellor reminded Germans that burning the Israeli flag or praising Hamas's actions were crimes. ""Anyone who is German will have to answer for this in court,"" Mr Habeck said in his message. ""Anyone who isn't German also risks losing their residence status. Anyone who doesn't yet have a residence permit is giving grounds for deportation."" Mr Habeck said some Muslim groups had been ""too hesitant"" in distancing themselves from Hamas or antisemitism, and he spoke of his concern about young activists on the left talking of ""anti-colonialism"". Not everyone was impressed. One former party colleague said she was disgusted he had implied that Muslim migrants and refugees had brought antisemitism into Europe. The head of Germany's Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, had earlier condemned antisemitism as a sin, stressing that Germany's five million Muslims should not all be lumped together. He went on to condemn Israel's bombing of Gaza as a war crime. When Hamas gunmen attacked Israeli communities on 7 October, activists celebrated on the streets of the Berlin district of Neukölln, handing out pastries to passers-by, sparking outrage in much of Germany. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser announced on Thursday that all activities linked to Hamas in Germany would be banned, along with a pro-Palestinian network called Samidoun that handed out the pastries. She said ""terror organisation Hamas pursues the goal of destroying the state of Israel"", while Samidoun was spreading propaganda against Israel and Jews under the pretence of acting as a ""solidarity organisation"" for the release of prisoners in various countries. Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist group in the EU, US and UK, so it was already banned in Germany. But Ms Faeser said outlawing its activities enabled authorities to broaden the ban and would make it easier to intervene in gatherings of supporters. Intelligence officials estimate Hamas has 450 members in Germany, many of them German citizens. A week after the Hamas attacks, antisemitic incidents in Germany soared by 240%, compared with the same period in 2022. Petrol bombs were thrown at a Berlin Jewish community centre and Jewish-owned homes have been daubed with slogans. The head of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, welcomed the bans and called for action against ""other hate organisations"". Neighbouring Austria has also seen a sharp increase in reported antisemitic incidents. On Tuesday night, a Jewish section of Vienna's central cemetery came under attack. A swastika was daubed on the wall and a fire broke out in a ceremonial hall. Although the cause of the fire was unclear, the head of the Jewish community, Oskar Deutsch, wrote on social media that the fire had destroyed valuable old books and a Torah Ark. In a separate development, police in France have said that a Moldovan couple have been detained on suspicion of spray-painting Stars of David on walls in Paris. They were arrested on 27 October, days before dozens of Stars of David tags appeared on buildings linked to the Jewish community in the 14th district of the capital. The couple, who said they had carried out the offence on behalf a third party, are now facing expulsion. Prosecutors have said they are unclear whether the tags were intended as an insult to the Jewish people or not. However, unconfirmed reports say another couple is being sought in connection with the other incidents.",2023-11-02T18:27:20.000Z

Palestinian Americans trapped in Gaza wait desperately to leavePublished2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Almost a month since the war broke out, Folla Saqer and her two children are still trapped in Gaza. Her husband, Ramiz Younis, is anxiously waiting for news that they have finally got out. The children - Zain, two, and Zaina, nine months - are American citizens. Along with Ms Saqer, a permanent legal resident, they are among roughly 1,000 people waiting to cross into neighbouring Egypt and begin their return to the US. The children are on a list published by Gaza's border authority approved to leave the enclave on Thursday, along with some 500 other foreigners, including 400 Americans. Ms Saqer - whose name is not on the list - attempted to pass through the Rafah crossing on Thursday morning but was denied, according to Justin Eisele, a lawyer for the family. He said no reason was provided, but ""based on comparing notes with other people"", her immigration status - a permanent resident, but not a citizen -  ""seems to be the distinction"". Since Wednesday, foreign passport holders and injured Gazans have been allowed through the Rafah crossing for the first time since the war began. But the US State Department has struggled to provide specifics on its processes for getting people out, and critics allege that government officials have been haphazard and vague in their correspondence. It is all stoking growing frustration among some Palestinian Americans as they, or their families, scramble to get out of Gaza. According to Mr Eisele, Ms Saqer was never made aware until her visit to the border that she - as a green card holder - would be unable to cross into Egypt. When her passage was barred, ""she elected to not hand her babies to a stranger"", he told the BBC. ""Before we give Israel $15bn, could we take a minute to organise a mother crossing the border with her children?"" he asked. ""You can ship rockets that can level a building but you can't organise a simple border crossing with two of our allegedly strongest allies?"" In a statement to the BBC, the State Department declined to say why Ms Saqer was unable to pass through the Rafah crossing. ""The Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas. It has been a top priority for us to get Rafah open not just for trucks coming in, but for US citizens and other foreign nationals coming out,"" a spokesperson said. ""We expect exits to continue over the next several days. We will not stop working to get US citizens and their family members out as safely as possible."" So desperate is Mr Younis to have his wife and children back home that, on Monday, the 51-year-old filed a federal lawsuit accusing the US government of discrimination and failure to do its duty towards its citizens. The legal action, which names Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin as defendants, alleges the family has been ""let down and ignored as if we are second-class citizens"". The Gaza-born Mr Younis returned to the enclave four years ago after marrying Ms Saqer. The couple resettled in Baltimore, Maryland, last year. Feeling homesick, Ms Saqer took the children to Gaza on a short trip earlier this year. She intended to come back in mid-October, by which time Mr Younis had completed their move to Little Rock, Arkansas. When the conflict erupted, Mr Younis immediately urged her to travel to the Egyptian border and wait for an opportunity to cross. In those first three days, he said, he didn't contact the State Department: ""The crossing was open and I thought I can do this on my own,"" he said. Ms Saqer took the children to her sister's place in Rafah, a 10-minute drive from the border. But the first time she attempted to leave, the waiting area by the crossing was bombed. In the frantic rush for cover, she left all their luggage behind. With the crossing closed, Mr Younis provided his family's information to the State Department. He received an email on 14 October with instructions that the crossing would open for five hours the next day. Ms Saqer and the children again went and waited, but they were not let through. Similar updates, including from local US embassies, would follow in the ensuing days, urging Ms Saqer to go to the border. She made four more trips. ""Whenever we have the chance to communicate, my wife asks me for news [from the government],"" said Mr Younis. ""Sometimes I don't have news, but I keep the hope alive. I need to keep the hope alive even if there is nothing happening."" The Okals, a suburban Massachusetts family who have been trapped in Gaza, are on the list of foreigners approved to leave the territory on Thursday. Abood Okal and Wafaa Abuzayda took their one-year-old son, Yousef, to the enclave last month to visit the grandparents he had never met. The family shared meals, went to the beach and rode horses together - until Hamas launched its attack on Israel six days before the Okals' intended departure. From Ms Abuzayda's home in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, the trio heeded Israeli warnings and fled south. Nobody knows if their home - which is located very close to a refugee camp bombed on Tuesday - is still standing. For nearly three weeks, the trio have stayed in a single-family home in Rafah with 40 other people, waiting for an opportunity to cross into Egypt. Every single day, they have contacted the State Department, as well as US embassies in Cairo and Jerusalem, according to Sammy Nabulsi, a family friend. On four separate occasions, they were advised to go to the Rafah crossing, waiting up to eight hours to cross. ""Their circumstances right now are completely dire and dangerous,"" said Mr Nabulsi on Wednesday. The 40-person house has lost running water and fuel, he told the BBC. Its residents are limiting the number of times they flush the toilets and with no cooking oil on hand, the family is largely living off canned tuna and fava beans.

"Swastikas sent to Belfast Jewish student, says peerPublished2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","A student at Queen's University Belfast (QUB) was sent swastikas for being Jewish, the government's independent adviser on antisemitism has said. Lord Mann told BBC News NI some students have hidden their identity and fear for their safety. Queen's said it was not aware of the incident and urged the student involved to contact the university. The peer visited Belfast on Wednesday to meet members of the Jewish community and political parties. He said the conflict between Israel and Hamas had led to religious attacks in the UK. ""Why are they picking on vulnerable, literally isolated Jewish students to vent this hatred?"" he asked. ""Where's the hatred coming from and what are the systems for dealing with this?"" Lord Mann said young Jewish people were ""keeping their heads down"" and are ""masking their identity"" in terms of wearing religious symbols. ""They're fearful that that will get a negativity, it will get them abuse,"" he told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster. Referring to the Queen's student who was sent swastikas, a symbol associated with Nazism, Lord Mann said: ""Why should a young Jewish person, a student here in Belfast, as a response to wearing a Jewish religious symbol around their neck, have more than one person responding with swastikas?"" When asked by BBC News NI for more details on how the student was sent the swastikas, Lord Mann said he did not want ""to end up identifying the person and the exact situation"". ""This is not normal behaviour, it is extremist behaviour and it is dangerous,"" he added. Queen's University told BBC News NI it was not aware of the incident ""and would urge the student to report this matter to us so it can be properly investigated"". It added that it was ""keen to engage with Lord Mann on this issue"". ""Queen's recognises the events that have led to the harrowing loss of life in the Middle East and the distressing and complex nature of the current conflict,"" a spokesperson said. ""The university is mindful of our students and colleagues with family and other connections in the region and remains committed to supporting them at this difficult time."" The university also said it had been in contact with the PSNI ""due to the seriousness of the allegations"", however, both Queen's and the PSNI said no report had been made to police by a student. ""The University's concern is this story is being presented as factual without any clear verification other than an anecdotal claim,"" a spokesperson continued on Thursday. ""Unchallenged suggestions that there is an ongoing problem at Queen's are completely without foundation. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Lord Mann also told BBC News NI he had asked to meet Sinn Féin during his visit but was not given a reason for why this had not happened. The party later said this had been an ""administrative oversight"" on its part. A spokesperson added the party has contacted Lord Mann's office to ""rearrange the meeting at the earliest opportunity possible"" and it looked ""forward to the opportunity to discuss the issue"". On Wednesday, more than 400 people left Gaza, according to Palestinian officials, including British and US passport holders. The territory has been bombed by Israel since the 7 October Hamas attacks in Israel which killed 1,400 people. More than 200 people were taken hostage. The health ministry run by Hamas said more than 8,700 people had been killed in the retaliatory bombings. ""I am here in terms of the security, the safety, and critically the wellbeing of a community that's traumatised and is terrified,"" Lord Mann said of his visit to Belfast. ""What I'm not comfortable with: Anybody in this time of conflict and war, in the Jewish community or indeed in the Muslim community, being targeted because of what's going on.""",2023-11-02T16:59:48.000Z

US President Joe Biden calls for 'pause' in Israel-Gaza conflictPublished2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"US President Joe Biden has called for a ""pause"" in the Israel-Hamas conflict. The president was making a campaign speech in Minneapolis when a heckler urged him to call for a ceasefire. ""I think we need a pause,"" he replied, saying that it would allow for hostages to get out. An unconfirmed number of American citizens left Gaza on Wednesday, as part of the first group to depart since war broke out. Another 400 are on a list to leave on Thursday. The Okals, a suburban Massachusetts family, were visiting relatives in Gaza when the conflict began. They are among those on the list provided by Gaza's border authority. Family friend Sammy Nabulsi told the BBC that Abood Okal, Wafaa Abuzayda and their one-year-old son, Yousef, have been living in ""dire and dangerous"" circumstances. There are no Canadians on the list on Wednesday or on the list for Thursday. Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said there were 400 Canadian citizens, mostly dual nationals, trapped in Gaza. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw 239 people taken hostage. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began. In Wednesday's speech, the president said a pause would ""give time to get the prisoners out"". White House officials later explained he had meant both getting hostages held by Hamas out and humanitarian aid in,the Associated Press reports. The UN has urged a ceasefire to ease the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where 1.4 million people are estimated to have been displaced. But the UK, US, Canada and EU have stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, saying it would favour Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organisation by the US and several Western governments. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, new House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, one of the most powerful Republicans in US government, firmly rejected the idea of a ceasefire. ""Israel doesn't need a ceasefire,"" he said. ""It needs its allies to cease with the politics and deliver support now, and that's what we're doing."" Mr Johnson said the House would vote later on Thursday on a $14.3bn (£11.7bn) aid package for Israel. Democrats oppose the bill because it also contains steep cuts in funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and they are expected to block it in the Senate. Even then, President Biden has said he will veto the legislation if the version that reaches his desk includes cuts to the tax collection agency.",2023-11-02T16:30:16.000Z

"Tanzanian student in Israel: 'Shift change saved me, but my friends are Hamas hostages'Published2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","""If I was not on the farm that morning, I would be one of the missing,"" Ezekiel Kitiku told the BBC from southern Israel. Two of his fellow Tanzanians - Joshua Loitu Mollel and Clemence Felix Mtenga - were among more than 230 people taken as hostages to the Gaza Strip, which is under the control of Hamas, proscribed as a terrorist group in the UK and some other countries. The three students had landed in Israel in September, excited to start their work as agricultural interns for the next 11 months. Since their arrival, Ezekiel Kitiku and Mr Mtenga had been living on Kibbutz Nir Oz and working at a dairy farm in the afternoons. Their friend Mr Mollel was staying and working about 30km (18 miles) away at Kibbutz Nahal Oz. Both kibbutzes have a population of several hundred people and are very near Gaza. ""That week the new timetable was prepared and my name was mentioned to work on the nightshifts, but Clemence remained on afternoon shifts,"" Mr Kitiku told the BBC. Mr Mollel was on day shifts at a different farm. At around 01:00 on 7 October, Mr Kitiku says he set off in the dark on his bike and rode five minutes to the farm to start his shift. He spent the early hours of that morning milking cows and carrying out veterinary duties. By 06:00, as the sun started to rise, he was tending to cattle inside a shed. Thirty minutes later he heard a huge explosion. This was when Hamas began to fire rockets from Gaza. ""When I heard the noise, I remembered that we had been told that if we hear the sound of shooting or bombs we should go to the shelter, so that's what I did. ""I was so scared. It was my first time to hear a noise like this."" As he headed to the shelter, he noticed thick smoke and orange flames billowing from near his kibbutz, so he immediately contacted both of his friends. ""They told me that there were so many rockets coming from Gaza - and that they were going to the shelters too."" Unknown to him, however, Hamas gunmen had already begun raiding the two kibbutzes where his friends were. A couple of hours later, he noticed that his WhatsApp and text messages were no longer being delivered to their phones. ""I thought maybe their phones were out of charge. The last message I sent to them was - 'Are you safe?'"" Neither replied. This was at around 10:00. He has not heard from them since. As rockets hammered down throughout the day, Mr Kitiku was forced to remain at the farm, trying to sleep inside the shelter. The following morning when things seemed a little calmer and desperate to find out what had happened to his friends, he begged his manager to take him back to his kibbutz. There he could see that troops from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had been deployed. ""At the gate of the kibbutz there were so many IDF soldiers. They refused me entry and told me I would have to go back to stay at the farm because it was safer."" He remained in the shelter at the farm with two others for another two days - with barely any food - and another night on his own. In the end the IDF said he would not be able to return to his kibbutz and soldiers escorted him to another location around 30km north of Gaza. As he left the farm, he was shocked by what he saw outside the gates. ""The water systems had been bombed, and water was flowing everywhere. I saw dead bodies on the street. ""The fear of what had happened to my friends started to grow."" The three men had met in Tanzania's economic hub of Dar es Salaam through their agriculture studies a few months before they travelled to Israel. It was not until three weeks after the Hamas attack that Mr Kitiku finally found out what had happened to his friends. The Israeli foreign affairs ministryannounced in a statement on Sundaythat they were being held hostage in Gaza. He says he is grateful to learn that they are both alive, but remains concerned about their conditions. He also knows other students on their programme who have been taken hostage, including one from Thailand. In addition to those they took hostage, Hamas gunmen killed about 1,400 people on 7 October, many of whom were living on kibbutzes. Since then, Israel has carried out air strikes on the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-run health ministry says some 9,000 people have been killed. Mr Kitiku says he is extremely worried about the safety of his friends being held in the Gaza Strip. ""There is so much bombing and people have few social services. I try to put myself in their shoes, but I cannot imagine what they are going through."" He says the realisation of how close he came to being caught up in the attack lies heavy on his mind. ""The first few days, psychologically I was not stable. I am trying to force myself to cope with the situation. ""If I was not on the farm that morning, I would be one of the missing."" He is now working at a different farm. ""The authorities in Israel told us we are safe and we can continue our internship here,"" he says. He and other Tanzanian students - there are an estimated 260 in Israel - have been offered assistance by their embassy to return home should they wish to, he says. ""But how can I think about going home when I don't know the situation and the condition of my two friends in Gaza?""",2023-11-02T16:29:51.000Z

M&S pulls Christmas advert post after Palestinian flag criticismPublished2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"M&S has apologised after being accused of posting an Instagram photo of Christmas party hats in the colours of the Palestinian flag on fire. The image, an out-take from one of the company's TV adverts, showed red, green and silver hats burning in a fireplace. M&S said the intent was to ""playfully show that some people don't enjoy wearing paper Christmas hats"". The company removed the photo and said the advert was filmed in August, before the latest Israel-Gaza conflict began. It said the hats were ""traditional, festive coloured red, green and silver Christmas paper hats"". ""We have removed the post following feedback and we apologise for any unintentional hurt caused,"" M&S addedin a statement posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday night. The photo was an out-take from the company's Christmas clothing and home advert, which is based on the premise that people should do away with Christmas traditions they no longer love. The picture drew criticism from several social media users who claimed there was a similarity between the colours of the hats and the Palestinian flag, with one user describing the photo as ""distasteful"". The company has also been defended by other social media users who said the hats are in traditional Christmas colours. Queer Eye presenter Tan France, who appears in the advert, said on Instagram: ""The ad was shot in August, so maybe you're reaching with your ridiculous comments."" The Advertising Standards Authority, which regulates advertising in the UK, says it has received 40 complaints about the Instagram post. The regulator says it is reviewing the complaints to determine whether further action is needed, but is not currently investigating the advert. Releasing the ""Love Thismas not Thatmas"" advert earlier this week, M&S said it was intended to ""celebrate and empower our customers to just do the things they love"". The advert also features actors Zawe Ashton and Hannah Waddingham, and singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor. More than 1,400 people were killed in attacks by Hamas on Israel on 7 October, while at least 239 people were taken hostage. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed since Israel launched air strikes as part of a military response to the attacks.",2023-11-02T11:36:22.000Z

Egypt opens Gaza border crossing to evacuate injured and foreign nationalsPublished2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Ambulances took 76 seriously injured Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt on Wednesday for the first time since the war between Hamas and Israel began. A group of 335 foreign passport holders - including British nationals - were also allowed to leave via the Rafah crossing, officials said. Gaza's borders have been closed since Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October. Rafah is expected to continue opening for limited time periods to let foreign nationals and injured civilians leave. The lists of those allowed to cross will be agreed between Egypt and Israel, with embassies from the relevant countries being informed in advance to ensure they can prepare to receive their citizens, Western officials say. The BBC understands there are about 7,000 dual nationals in Gaza. Speaking on Wednesday evening, US President Joe Biden said that thanks to ""concerted American leadership, safe passage for wounded Palestinians and foreign nationals has started"". American citizens were able to exit, he said, as part of the first group of ""probably more than 1,000"", adding that the process would continue over ""the coming days"". ""We're working non-stop to get Americans out of Gaza as soon and as safely as possible,"" Mr Biden stressed. UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly earlier said the departure of the first of the estimated 200 Britons in the territory was ""a hugely important first step"". ""We are working with Egyptian and Israeli authorities to ensure the crossing stays open so all British nationals can get to safety in the coming days,""he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Israel has been bombarding Gaza for more than three weeks and has recently sent in ground forces in response to an unprecedented cross-border assault by Hamas gunmen in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 taken hostage. Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,700 people have been killed in the territory since then, while the UN says supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel. Ambulances were seen rushing to Rafah on Wednesday morning. At least two children were among the wounded - one with a bandaged stomach. After medical checks, they were carried away on stretchers. At least 76 had arrived in Egypt by the evening, according to a spokesperson for the Palestinian border authority and an Egyptian official. ""Hospitals in the Gaza Strip are treating large numbers of injured people while suffering from a lack of medical supplies. Therefore [they] cannot operate on such cases,"" Nassem Hasan, a medic working with Gaza's health ministry, told Reuters news agency. ""Now they are being transported to the Egyptian side, and will then be evaluated and might be relocated to another hospital."" Most of the patients will be taken to a field hospital built by Egyptian authorities in Sheikh Zuweid, 15km (9 miles) from Rafah. Others will go to permanent hospitals in the nearby town of El-Arish or the city of Ismailia. The director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,welcomed Egypt's decision to accept medical evacuations. But he warned: ""Attention must not be diverted from the far greater needs of thousands of patients in Gaza, many of them extremely fragile who cannot be moved. ""We need an immediate acceleration in the flow of medical aid permitted into Gaza. Hospitals must be protected from bombardment and military use."" The WHO says more than a third of Gaza's hospitals are not functioning, while the rest are only partly working and are overwhelmed by casualties. Gaza's health ministry says more than 20,000 people have been injured. The Palestinian border authority said 335 foreign and dual nationals had crossed by Wednesday evening. As well as the unspecified number of Britons, they included 31 Austrians, five French nationals, four Italians and some Americans. Médecins Sans Frontières said 22 of its international staff had successfully crossed. Egyptian state-run Al-Qahera News TV broadcast footage showing what it said was the first group getting off a coach, which included many women and young children. Mohammed Ghalayini, a British scientist from Manchester who had been in Gaza visiting family when the war began, accompanied his uncle to the crossing after he was named by Gaza authorities on the list of potential evacuees. ""People are really afraid of what's going on and so if they have a chance to leave, they're trying to leave,"" he told the BBC. ""But getting to the border is a struggle as well, because fuel supplies are short,"" he added. ""So you know, I saw people arriving on a donkey cart with their luggage at the border."" Other British nationals hoping to cross in the coming days include the parents-in-law of Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf. He welcomed news that the border was opening up, but said his in-laws were trapped without clean drinking water and with rapidly diminishing supplies. Also on Wednesday, another an Israeli air strike destroyed several residential buildings in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, for the second day in a row. Video footage and photos showed a scene of devastation in the north-western Fallujah area, with hundreds of people searching for survivors underneath rubble and shattered buildings. The Hamas-run health ministry said dozens of people were killed or wounded in the attack. On Wednesday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a statement saying its fighter jets ""struck a Hamas command and control complex"" in Jabalia. ""We can confirm that Hamas terrorists were eliminated in the strike,"" it added. ""Hamas deliberately builds its terror infrastructure under, around and within civilian buildings, intentionally endangering Gazan civilians."" The IDF also said it had been urging residents of Jabalia and other parts of northern Gaza to evacuate ""to mitigate harm to civilians"", as tanks and troops continue to advance from a number of directions. On Tuesday, the IDF said a strike in the centre of Jabalia camp had killed a senior Hamas commander and ""a large number of terrorists"" inside ""underground terror infrastructure"" embedded beneath buildings. The infrastructure and buildings had collapsed as a result, it added. Gaza's health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded. But a nearby hospital said it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead. Hamas denied that the commander was dead but said seven of the hostages taken from Israel, including three foreign passport holders, were killed in the strike - a claim that could not be verified. In a brief statement on X on Wednesday, the UN human rights office warned: ""Given the high number of civilian casualties & the scale of destruction following Israeli air strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes."" UN Secretary General António Guterres's spokesman also said he was ""appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza"" and reiterated that all parties must abide by international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution.",2023-11-02T06:41:06.000Z

Cornell student in court over threats to kill JewsPublished2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A student at an elite New York college has been held in jail after appearing in court accused of posting violent threats against Jewish students. Prosecutors say Patrick Dai, 21, made threats to bring a gun to the Cornell University campus and rape Jewish women and ""behead any Jewish babies"". The engineering student appeared in court in an orange jump suit. He has been charged with posting threats to kill or injure another using interstate communications. The crime is punishable by up to five years in prison. Mr Dai's mother was in the court in Syracuse, New York state, on Wednesday afternoon. She leaned forward in an apparent attempt to make eye contact with her son, according to local media. Prosecutor Geoffrey Brown asked that Mr Dai be remanded in custody, noting that he had visited a campus dining hall before allegedly posting threats to ""shoot up"" the area. Mr Dai waived his right to a bail hearing. The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper, first reported on a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank. The platform, which is not affiliated with the university but is used by many of its students, covers fraternity and sorority life on several campuses. One post from the commenter named ""hamas"" was titled ""if i see another jew"". Mr Dai's parents told the New York Post that their son suffers from ""severe depression"". ""He cannot control his emotion well due to the depression,"" Mr Dai's father, who asked not to be named, told the newspaper in a text message. ""No, I don't think he committed the crime. He told us he lost his life goal and motivation. As parents, we tried to give him more love."" Mr Dai's father said he and his wife lost communication with their son in the days before his arrest. They had attempted to contact him, he said, worried he might commit suicide. In a statement, Cornell University said: ""We remain shocked by and condemn these horrific, antisemitic threats and believe they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law."" The university said that police will maintain a heightened security presence on campus in the coming days. Molly Goldstein, co-president of the Cornell Center for Jewish Living, told CNN: ""Jewish students on campus right now are unbelievably terrified for their lives."" The threats against Cornell's Jewish community came amid reports of rising antisemitic incidents around the country. Speaking to a congressional committee on Tuesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers that antisemitic abuse was reaching ""historic levels"" in the US. ""Our statistics would indicate that for a group that represents only about 2.4% of the American public, they account for something like 60% of all religious-based hate crimes,"" Mr Wray said of Jewish Americans. He noted that this figure had probably risen since the Israel-Gaza conflict erupted on 7 October.",2023-11-02T01:29:30.000Z

"Israel Gaza: Children must be off limits, says father of abducted kidsPublished2 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","In the garden of his home in central Israel, amid the palm trees dappled in the morning sun, Yoni Asher shows me a video on his phone. It's of his two small girls, sitting on a bed. They're singing Happy Birthday. Raz, the eldest, with long fair hair, is just four years old. Her sister Aviv, darker and more like her dad, is only two. ""They made this for my birthday in July,"" Yoni tells me. But four months on, the 37-year-old father and husband is home alone. Along with their mother Doron, they were captured on 7 October in Hamas's unprecedented cross border attack. They are thought to be among the youngest of the 240 hostages being held in Gaza. ""They had been visiting their grandma for the holidays in Nir Oz,"" Yoni says. The Israeli kibbutz sits only two miles from Gaza. It was one of the communities worst affected by the attack, with one in four of those who lived there believed to have been killed or kidnapped by Hamas. Yoni was not with his family that day. He'd stayed home for work, a hundred miles away. The first confirmation his family had been abducted by Hamas came in a video, posted on TikTok from inside Gaza. Yoni shows it to me. In the five-second clip, you can see his wife Doron, still in her nightwear crammed onto a motorised cart surrounded by Hamas gunmen. Raz is there in a pink summer dress. ""That's Aviv's hand,"" Yoni says, pointing to five tiny fingers, reaching out towards her mother. That was more than three weeks ago. Yoni has not seen or heard of his family since. Their grandma, Efrat Katz, has been found dead. Her partner, Gadi Mozes, also abducted, is missing. ""The only way to describe it is hell,"" says Yoni. ""It's the definition of hell."" ""How can I eat when I don't know what my family are eating? How can I sleep when I don't know if they if they are cold or too hot?"" ""As a father, if you ever saw your children jumping on the bed, or the sofa, you worry they will fall on their head. So, imagine how I feel in this situation. Everything is frightening to me."" For now, all Yoni has are memories. And inside the family home, they are everywhere. Photographs and children's artwork on the wall. Tiny handprints in red paint. ""They loved to draw. Raz did this one for me,"" says Yoni, pointing to a cartoon-like figure on a pin board that's meant to look like him. ""She told me it's a superhero."" There's the familiar toy kitchen. ""They always liked to pretend to cook for me."" Yoni goes on. A collection of tiny shoes is lined up in the corner amid children's books. ""I had to take all the batteries out of the noisy toys,"" he says. ""They are tiny balls of energy. With three women in the house, we had enough noise for any man,"" Yoni tells me managing to raise a smile. I ask him how he feels about the suffering in Gaza, now under Israeli bombardment for almost a month and where the United Nations says thousands of children have been killed or injured. ""Children are children, it doesn't matter which country they are from,"" he says. ""Children need to be off limits. I can't hate not even the children of my so-called enemies. How can you hate a child?"" And what about the hostage videos that have been released by Hamas? ""It was not easy to watch,"" Yoni replies. ""They're the ones who got kidnapped. They [Hamas] are taking advantage [of] them in a cynical and the lowest way possible, in order to make some kind of psychological battle."" At 37 years old, Yoni has known the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians his entire life. His parents knew it before him. But for him, 7 October is obviously the worst moment. ""It's one day of Holocaust,"" he tells me, as he pauses to choose his words. ""I know it's a harsh word. But that day was the worst that was seen in the history of the Jewish people and the Israeli people."" Does he think Israel can ever get over its collective trauma? ""We have no other choice. It's like my own personal case. It's either fight or be dropped,"" he says. ""We have to recover. It will be very difficult. But I believe in the long term, our nation will recover."" For now though, all Yoni can do is wait, hope and tell his family's story.",2023-11-02T00:30:42.000Z

Rafah crossing: First Britons leave Gaza but others face nervous waitPublished1 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"British nationals have left Gaza for the first time since war with Israel broke out last month. The UK Foreign Office confirmed an unspecified number of UK passport holders had been able to leave via the Rafah crossing into Egypt on Wednesday. It said the route was being opened for ""controlled and time-limited periods"" to allow some foreign nationals and injured Palestinians to leave. About 200 British nationals are believed to be in Gaza. It emerged on Wednesday that some 500 people a day would be allowed through the crossing, which is controlled by Egyptian authorities. Thousands gathered at the border this morning hoping to leave, but it emerged that only those whose names appeared on a limited list agreed by the Egyptian and Israeli governments would be permitted to cross. The UK Foreign Office said it had handed over the names of people who wished to leave Gaza. On Wednesday evening, it confirmed some Britons were among a group of around 400 foreign nationals and injured Palestinians who had crossed, but did not say who or how many. Earlier, the BBC spoke to British-Palestinian doctor Abdelkader Hammad, who was told he was in the first group allowed to leave. But when he arrived at the crossing point, he found the route was closed and described frustration and confusion at the border. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme at around 16:00 GMT (18:00 in Gaza) from the crossing point, Dr Hammad said: ""It's a little frustrating. We don't know what's going on...we don't know when the next group will go - if it will be tonight or tomorrow. ""It's dark - I'm not sure it will happen tonight, we'll see what happens tomorrow."" Speaking from the Rafah crossing at around 13:00 GMT, BBC News reporter Rushdi Abualouf said thousands of people were already at the border when it emerged only those on the list would be allowed through. With no passport control or electronic ID system in place, the process is slowed by the need for an official to manually check the identities of every person leaving, he reported. He also saw between 20 and 30 ambulances passing through the crossing carrying injured people into Egypt for medical treatment. Routes in and out of Gaza have been closed since Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group in the UK - attacked Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostage. BBC News understands that 14 British nationals were among those killed. Three more are missing. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,700 people have been killed since Israel launched air strikes as part of a military response to the attacks. The partial opening of the Rafah crossing follows international diplomatic efforts to convince Egypt to allow people to leave and aid to be transported into the enclave.Rishi Sunak held a further call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Wednesday evening. Speaking to the BBC at theAI summit in Londonearlier on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said the government was committed to getting humanitarian supplies into Gaza, and helping UK passport holders leave. He continued: ""We're playing an active role in getting aid into Gaza to help those people who need it, but also diplomatically working with everyone in the region to find ways to move our British nationals out of Gaza and hopefully bring them home."" Foreign Secretary James Cleverley called the first departures from Gaza a ""hugely important first step"". He earlier said British officials are on the ground in Egypt ""ready to assist British nationals as soon as they are able to leave"". Western officials told the BBC a team had been deployed to Arish, a city some 25 miles (41km) away from Rafah, to ""ensure we can provide the necessary medical, consular and administrative support needed"" for British nationals. Among the British nationals in Gaza are Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf's in-laws. He welcomed the opening of the border but said his wife's parents remained trapped without clean drinking water and rapidly diminishing supplies. Both Mr Sunak and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have called for humanitarian ""pauses"" in fighting to allow the movement of aid. Humanitarian pauses tend to last for shorter periods of time than formal ceasefires, sometimes just a few hours. They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions,according to the United Nations.",2023-11-01T21:44:44.000Z

'I simply don’t want to die at 24' - Gaza woman trapped at Rafah crossingPublished1 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"This was their third time trying to cross. But there were reasons to hope. All the news reports said the border would definitely open. The family had been called by the Jordanian embassy and told to go to the Rafah crossing. Tala Abu Nahleh's mother is a Jordanian citizen. Foreign passport holders were going to be allowed through. So were the wounded and the seriously sick. Tala's 15-year-old brother Yazid is disabled and suffers from seizures. He can only move from one place to another with the aid of a wheelchair. The hospitals in Gaza have run out of the medication he needs, while the bombing has exacerbated his condition. ""Once the escalation started,"" Tala says, ""he got very afraid, the seizures kept getting worse and worse. Every time I believe it's gotten to the worst, it just keeps getting worse."" There are six in the family and Tala is the sole financial support. She won scholarships and studied in the US and Beirut, Lebanon. Confident and articulate as she is, it is easy to imagine her guiding her family through the challenges of life beyond Gaza's borders. ""We are trying to survive. We're not sure we're going to make it, but we're trying to do everything we can to survive, because I simply don't want to die at 24."" The border is a place where the word ""luck"" has different meanings. It means escaping bombing, hunger and lack of water. It also means having to leave behind those you love who don't have foreign passports, or who are not badly wounded enough to merit evacuation, or who are trapped under fire and cannot reach the border. The number of those who have left, or will be able to leave, is only a tiny percentage of Gaza's population of 2.2 million people. Mona - she did not wish to give her surname - is an Australian citizen through marriage. She came to the border alone and was haunted by the thought of her family trapped in Gaza. ""I'm not happy at all, because I'm leaving my other part, my brothers and sisters, my whole family is still here. I wish, God willing, they would all be in a safe place. The situation is terrible there, it's very very bad,"" she says. Groups of men gathered in front of paper lists posted on windows on the Gaza side of the crossing. Fingers ran down lines of names seeking out those already approved for departure. Families sat on the plastic chairs of the waiting hall, a small space into which so much hope is being funnelled. Altogether, 400 foreign nationals and wounded people were able to leave Gaza on the first day of the evacuation on Wednesday. By the day's end, it was clear to Tala Abu Nahleh that her family would not be so fortunate. They went home to their apartment, dark like those of their neighbours because there is no electricity. Tala sent us a video message saying she did not know how to feel any more. She sounded and looked weary. ""We came back to no electricity, no food for today, no clean water to drink or even washing water. And one more day closer to my brother running out of medications, and we're still here. And it's night. I don't know if we will make it tomorrow, but I hope so.""

What is the Rafah crossing and why is it Gaza's lifeline?Published1 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The first civilians from the Gaza Strip have crossed the Rafah border into Egypt since the Israel-Gaza war started. Dozens of severely injured Palestinians were taken in ambulances and hundreds of foreign passport holders made the crossing on Wednesday. Egypt said it would initially allow in more than 80 injured and more than 500 foreign and dual nationals in total, in a deal said to have been brokered by Qatar. This is the first such evacuation since the conflict began more than three weeks ago. It is not clear how long the border will stay open. It has already been open for more than 10 days to allow aid into Gaza. So far, more than 200 trucks have crossed the border, but much more is needed. It's the southernmost post of exit from Gaza and borders Egypt's Sinai peninsula. There are only two other border crossings from and into the Gaza Strip - Erez, a crossing into Israel in northern Gaza, which is for people, and Kerem Shalom, a solely commercial goods junction with Israel in southern Gaza. Both are shut. Gunmen from the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked the Erez crossing on 7 October during an unprecedented assault on southern Israel which killed more than 1,300 people. Days later, Israel declared Erez and Kerem Shalom closed until further notice, leaving the Rafah border as the only way into and out of the Strip for people. Rafah is now also the only crossing point for humanitarian aid. Hamas and Egypt exercise control over who can pass through, but operations have been disrupted since Israel began conducting waves of air strikes on Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's assault. Egyptian media said the crossing was shut down following three Israeli strikes on 9 and 10 October, which it said left injuries on the Egyptian and Palestinian sides of the border. On 12 October, the Egyptian government asked Israel to halt strikes near the Rafah border crossing so it could serve as a ""support lifeline"" for people in Gaza, and made it clear that it would not open the passage until there were guarantees for the safety of its staff. Three weeks later, people are gathering at the border following reports that Qatar has mediated an agreement to allow some people out of Gaza. Reuters news agency says the Gulf state has been holding talks between Egypt, Israel and Hamas, in coordination with the US. It is this deal that is allowing some critically injured people and foreign passport holders out of the Gaza Strip. Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas - which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012. Israel and Egypt have restricted the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. The two countries say their blockade is needed for security reasons. As part of its response to Hamas's deadly attack, Israel's defence minister ordered a ""complete siege"" of Gaza on 9 October, adding: ""There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed."" Meanwhile Egypt fears a massive influx of Palestinian refugees fleeing the war. Egypt's president warned on 12 October that an exodus from Gaza risked ""liquidating"" the Palestinian cause and called on Palestinians to ""remain steadfast on their land"". It is also concerned about the possibility of Islamist militants coming into the country, having faced a jihadist insurgency in Sinai for almost a decade. It is not easy for Palestinians to leave Gaza via Rafah. Palestinians wishing to use the crossing must register with the local Palestinian authorities two to four weeks in advance and may be rejected by either the Palestinian or Egyptian authorities with little warning or explanation. According to the UN, in August 2023, the Egyptian authorities allowed 19,608 exits from Gaza and denied entry to 314 people.",2023-11-01T16:39:07.000Z

McDonald's condemns Birmingham restaurant mice protestsPublished1 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"McDonald's has condemned what it called disinformation over the Israel-Gaza war after boxes of live mice were released in three of its restaurants in apparent protests. A video on social media showed customers at Birmingham's Star City restaurant jumping in shock as mice dyed in the colours of the Palestinian flag scurried near their feet on Monday. A second clip showed mice in a box in the Perry Barr branch. West Midlands Police has launched an investigation into the first case. The fast food giant said both stores were temporarily closed for a full clean and visits from pest control officers. Police said they were treating the first incident, an apparent protest againstthe Israel-Gaza war,as a public nuisance offence. A video of a reported third incident of the same nature was also shared across social media on Wednesday. In the clip, a group of masked people appear to enter the branch in Small Heath and empty a clear plastic box filled with live mice near the counter. After Hamas gunmen launched an assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, a branch of the restaurant chain in Israelreportedly donated 100,000 of free meals including to soldiers and security forces. The move sparked calls from Pro-Palestinian activists to boycott the brand, theDaily Express reported. A spokesperson for McDonald's said the firm was ""dismayed by the disinformation and inaccurate reports regarding our position in response to the conflict in the Middle East."" The chain added: ""McDonald's Corporation is not funding or supporting any governments involved in this conflict, and any actions from our local developmental licensee business partners were made independently without McDonald's consent or approval. ""Our hearts are with all of the communities and families impacted by this crisis. We abhor violence of any kind and firmly stand against hate speech, and we will always proudly open our doors to everyone.

Slough Labour councillors defy Starmer by calling for Gaza ceasefirePublished1 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"All 18 Labour councillors in Slough have called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza - a position at odds with party leader Sir Keir Starmer. In a joint statement, they said ""human rights and adherence to international law must prevail"". Slough group leader Pavitar Kaur Mann told the BBC they had ""watched with absolute horror what's been happening"". Labour leader Sir Keirargued on Tuesdaythat a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact. But he also said a humanitarian pause was ""the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering"". Slough Borough Council is currently Conservative-run - with the backing of the Liberal Democrats -after the party took control in May's electionsfor the first time since the 1980s. Last week, Labourlost its majority of Oxford City Councilafter a wave of resignations due to the issue. Slough's Labour group leader Ms Mann said constituents were raising ""very significant concerns"" about the ""humanitarian impact on the Palestinian population"". She added: ""We want that humanitarian access to be paramount and unimpeded… that's also what I heard Keir saying. ""So I actually think there's a lot more in common with what the Labour Party as a whole is saying than there is actually a lot different."" The statement from the councillors said: ""Israel suffered a terrorist attack at the hands of Hamas - Israel has a right to defend its citizens in line with international law and we are united in our call for the immediate release of all hostages. However, the Palestinian people are not Hamas. ""There must be unimpeded, unconditional humanitarian access to Gaza, to enable vital food, water, fuel and medical supplies to meet the urgent needs of innocent civilians."" It said that there was also a ""worrying rise in both antisemitism and Islamophobic crimes in the UK"". By not backing a full ceasefire, Sir Keir is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.

"Paris graffiti recall 1930s antisemitism, says mayorPublished1 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Stars of David have been found graffitied on buildings in the Paris area, in acts that political leaders have said ""recall the 1930s"". Some 60 Stars of David were painted on walls in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on Monday night. France is grappling with a big rise in antisemitic incidents. More than 850 such acts have been reported in France since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October, says Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin. Paris authorities announced that an investigation into degradation of property aggravated by racist intent would be launched. ""I am crying, because I am once again seeing the hate that we received when I was a child,"" a resident of one of the buildings graffitied told the broadcaster BFMTV. ""I can't understand it."" In a statement, the mayoralty of the 14th arrondissement wrote that the acts ""recall the events of the 1930s... which led to the extermination of millions of Jews"". Emmanuel Grégoire, deputy to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, said the stars would be removed and an investigation launched. ""Antisemitism continues to kill,"" Mr Grégoire said. ""We will never give up the fight."" Separately, a woman wascritically injured after being shot by policeon Tuesday morning. Officers claimed she was behaving in a threatening way and refused to comply with instructions. Similar graffiti was also found in Parisian suburbs including Vanves, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Aubervilliers and Saint-Ouen. The stars were sometimes accompanied by inscriptions such as ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will win,"" according to reports. The Mayor of Saint-Ouen, Karim Bouamrane, called for the authors of the ""antisemitic and racist"" graffiti in his city to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Prosecutors have cautioned, however, that it is still unclear whether the stars are antisemitic in nature. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne condemned what she termed ""disgraceful acts"". The sharp rise in antisemitic incidents worries 83% of French people, a poll for BFMTV found. Political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron, have warned of the risk of ""importing"" tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas war into France. About 400 people have been arrested for antisemitic acts this month, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Sunday.",2023-11-01T09:17:26.000Z

Bolivia severs diplomatic ties with Israel over Gaza warPublished1 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Bolivia has become the first Latin American country to cut diplomatic ties with Israel over what it describes as ""aggressive and disproportionate"" military actions in Gaza. The country called for a ceasefire and said it would be supplying the blockaded Gaza Strip with aid. An Israeli official said the move was ""a surrender to terrorism"". Lior Haiat accused the Bolivian government of ""aligning itself with the Hamas terrorist organization"". Bolivia's Deputy Foreign Minister Freddy Mamani said that the government had taken the decision to cut ties ""in repudiation and condemnation of the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in the Gaza Strip"". He added that the country wanted an end to Israel's blockade that was preventing ""the entry of food, water and other essential elements for life"". Gaza has been under an Israeli siege for weeks, with essential aid only reaching people through Egypt's Rafah crossing sporadically. ""Israel condemns Bolivia's support of terrorism and its submission to the Iranian regime, which attest to the values the government of Bolivia represents,"" Mr Haiat said in response. Iran has been accused of providing support for Hamas to carry out the 7 October attacks. While Iran's leaders have celebrated and praised the violence, they have denied involvement. Bolivia is not the only Latin American country to have begun taking diplomatic steps against Israel. Chile's President Gabriel Boric said on Tuesday he was recalling the country's ambassador in Tel Aviv for consultations ""given the unacceptable violations of International Humanitarian Law that Israel has incurred in the Gaza Strip."" ""Chile strongly condemns and observes with great concern that these military operations - which at this point in their development entail collective punishment of the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Colombian President Gustavo Petro made a similar announcement on social media. ""I have decided to call our ambassador in Israel for consultation,"" Mr Petro said, adding that ""if Israel does not stop the massacre of the Palestinian people we cannot be there."" Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva urged a ceasefire. Following reports of a new Israeli air strike in Gaza,Lula said on X: ""We are seeing, for the first time, a war in which the majority of those killed are children... Stop! For the love of God, stop!"" The majority of the 8,500 war deaths reported by the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza are of adults but they include 3,500 children. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the Hamas attack of 7 October that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people taken hostage. The US said on Tuesday that 66 trucks had been able to deliver aid inside Gaza, but charities warn that it will not be enough. United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini said that prior to the war, about 500 trucks would enter Gaza each day. Bolivia only restored diplomatic relations with Israel in 2019. It had previously cut ties with the country in 2009 under President Evo Morales, again to protest against Israel's actions in Gaza. On Monday, Bolivia's President Luis Arce described Israel's actions in Gaza as ""war crimes""on Xafter meeting with the Palestinian ambassador to Bolivia, Mahmoud Elalwani.",2023-11-01T09:08:51.000Z

""There is anger and frustration because it's not just about the conflict now,"" he says. ""It's about the daily images people are seeing of civilians, children, women, old people. Nobody wants to see that. ""At the end of the day, humanity prevails everything."" Since the conflict began on 7 October, the forum has been calling for all communities ""to act responsibly and to support and protect each other against any form of hatred and provocation"". In a statement, it said people should ""unite in remembering that what we have in common far surpasses the differences in our culture and heritage"". Salford councillor Heather Fletcher, the forum's Jewish co-chairwoman, toldBBC North West Tonightthat ""the way forward is always that people get to know each other [and] become friendly with each other, because it's ignorance that makes people intolerant"". ""Being familiar with people and being friendly with them and learning about each other's cultures makes people understand each other and it's understanding that's the key,"" she said. She said it was important to make sure the message the forum published was acceptable to all communities. ""Just a couple of words out of place can make the whole thing sound different or upset one community or another community,"" she says. David Berkley KC, a member of the forum's executive committee, said he had said to his friends from both faiths that ""were it not for that unequivocal statement from the forum, I certainly wouldn't be sitting at this table today"". He said the group was about ""identifying those things we have in common and those things upon which we disagree"". ""One of the things that I think has made it possible to have an impact is our willingness to acknowledge that there was these issues, which we cannot ignore,"" he added. ""We have identified these issues and been willing to have an open and honest discussion about the things that matter to us."" Mohammed Amin, the forum's Muslim co-chairman, said since it was launched almost two decades ago, he had noticed a ""change in atmosphere as a consequence of our activities"". ""I didn't have any social contact with Jewish people as an adult,"" he said. ""In 50 years, I had never set foot inside a synagogue and helping to set up the forum has transformed my life in terms of expanding my understanding. ""As far as Manchester is concerned, we made it much more normal for Muslims and Jews to do things together."" Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,XandInstagram?

Strikes on south Gaza: BBC verifies attacks in areas of ‘safety’Published1 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Since the Israeli military issued the first of several instructions for civilians to evacuate north Gaza, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have moved to the south of the strip. But the south has continued to come under Israeli bombardment, leading the UN and other aid organisations to warn that nowhere in Gaza is safe for civilians. To better understand the risk to civilians in south Gaza, BBC Verify has identified and analysed four specific instances of strikes in that region. We also looked at some of the warnings and evacuation instructions that were issued to Gazan civilians, including some advising them to move to certain areas in the south. Some of these warnings were accompanied by maps with arrows pointing to vaguely defined areas to move towards. Three strikes we examined hit within, or close to, those areas in the days after the warnings were issued. The IDF has said that it communicates with Gaza's residents in a variety of ways, including leaflet drops, social media posts in Arabic, and warnings issued through civilian and international organisations. In this piece we have examined the IDF's instructions posted on social media. The IDF said on 10 October that overnight its fighter jets had struck more than 200 targets in Rimal in the north, and Khan Younis in the south. The BBC has examined a strike on that day in central Khan Younis to understand the location and the scale of the damage. Video footage published in the aftermath of the attack shows rubble and collapsed buildings in the city centre. We have verified its location using visual clues such as the minaret of the Grand Mosque in Khan Younis. We have also examined photos showing destroyed buildings, and people picking through what remains of cars and homes. We know the photos show the same location as that seen in the video because the same pharmacy sign can be seen in both. We also used reverse image search to check that the photos were not from an earlier incident. On the morning of 8 October, IDF spokesperson Avichay Adraehad posted a warning on X(formerly known as Twitter) in Arabic, giving instructions to residents of various areas in Gaza to leave their homes and move elsewhere for their safety. While evacuation zones have often been clearly delineated, the destinations residents have been told to head to have often been much more vague. In this instance, those living in the neighbourhoods of Abasan al-Kabira and Abasan al-Saghira, a few kilometres south-east of central Khan Younis, were told in the 8 October tweet to go to ""Khan Younis city centre."" The map included in the tweeted video for those living in the two neighbourhoods highlights their current residencies, and is labelled with an arrow simply pointing in the direction of Khan Younis. We cannot discount the possibility that there were then subsequent different instructions, but the BBC has not found any evidence of this. The BBC has verified that there was another strike the next day, further south near the border with Egypt. This 11 October strike hit Nejmeh Square in the centre of Rafah. The BBC looked at a video posted to social media showing destruction in the strike's aftermath. Using available images of the square before the attack, we were able to identify the shape of the buildings as that of Nejmeh square. The warning, issued on 8 Octoberby the IDF, also contained an instruction for residents of Rafah, telling them to immediately go to the shelter in Rafah city centre ""for your safety"". The map in the video for those living in the Rafah neighbourhoods contains an arrow directing residents towards ""Rafah"". The BBC analysed all of the IDF social media warning posts in Arabic it is aware of in this time period. It has not been able to find evidence of any subsequent different instructions, but that does not eliminate the possibility that others were issued. Eight days on, back in Khan Younis, there was another strike - on Gamal Abdel Nasser Street. We verified this by looking at videos of the collapsed buildings in one of the city's main thoroughfares. By matching the shape of the buildings in the video, with those in other still images of the same location, we were able to verify this was the same place. Additional footage from the aftermath shows bodies of the dead and injured being pulled out of rubble and taken to nearby Nasser hospital. TheIDF had issued a warningon 16 October for residents of Gaza City to move south to Khan Younis if ""your safety and the safety of your loved ones are important to you"". Again, there is a possibility that there were further instructions that were different, but we have not found any evidence of this. Further north, in central Gaza, there are four refugee camps. The BBC has verified strikes on two of them. Social media footage of the aftermath of a strike on al-Bureij camp on 17 October shows extensive rubble, flames, and bloodied bodies being carried out of the damage. We have verified the footage by matching up buildings in this footage with photos by news agencies of the aftermath. We also verified the footage location using a mosque that was visible. Another camp nearby, al-Nuseirat, was struck the next day, on 18 October. We have verified social media footage of the aftermath, which shows ambulances, detritus, people trying to douse flames and a destroyed bakery. We located it by matching the shop names that can be seen in the video with those seen in photos published before the strike took place. Despite theearlier 8 October warning instructing residentsof the eastern and southern Maghazi area to go to camps in central Gaza, there do not appear to be any camps in the location specified on the tweet's map. We have however identified three camps nearby: al-Nuseirat and al-Bureij, hit by the strikes on the 17 and 18 October, and another camp called Deir al-Balah. We cannot discount the possibility that there were then subsequent different instructions, but the BBC has not found any evidence of this. The aftermath of another strike in al-Nuseirat camp, on 25 October, was shown on the news outlet Al Jazeera. Footage posted online shows its chief Gaza correspondent Wael al-Dahdouh in tears in hospital, holding the body of his seven-year-old daughter and kneeling over the body of his teenage son. His wife was also killed. ""There is no safe place in Gaza at all,"" he said in anEnglish translation of an interview with Al Jazeera. He said that his family had moved from the north following Israel's warning to residents to move south for their safety. The BBC provided specific locations and dates to the IDF for each of the strikes highlighted in the article. We asked if these locations had been struck by IDF forces and whether warnings had been given prior to these attacks. In its response the IDF said it ""cannot provide any further information regarding these specific locations"". It said that it had ""called on civilians in Gaza to move south for their safety but will continue striking terrorist targets in all parts of Gaza"". It added: ""In accordance with international law, the IDF takes precautionary measures in order to avoid damage to the civilian population. These measures include warnings before strikes in cases where it is possible to do so."" Sign up for our morning newsletterand get BBC News in your inbox.",2023-11-01T00:21:19.000Z

What China wants from Israel-Hamas warPublished1 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"As the conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifies, an unlikely development has emerged - China playing the part of peace broker. But there are limits to what it can achieve. China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution. Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings. There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to ""urge calm"" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times. China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare détente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it ""stands ready to strengthen communication with China"" on resolving the situation in Gaza. As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense. In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. ""Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table."" But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics. ""China is not a serious actor on this issue. Talking to people around the region, nobody expects China to contribute to the solution,"" said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who specialises in China's relations with the Middle East. China'sfirst statement on the conflictangered Israel which expressed ""deep disappointment"" that China did not condemn Hamas nor mention Israel's right to defend itself. Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 239 hostages. Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which more than 8,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has now also sent troops and tanks into the territory. After the furore over its first statement, Mr Wang later told Israel that ""all countries have the right to self-defence"" - but he also said elsewhere that Israel's actions have gone ""beyond the scope of self-defence"". China faces a difficult balancing act because it has long openly sympathised with the Palestinian cause. It stretches back to Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called ""national liberation"" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism. In later decades China opened up economically and normalised relations with Israel, with whom it now has a billion-dollar trade relationship. But China has made it clear it continues to support the Palestinians. In their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. One side effect is an uptick in antisemitism online, fanned by nationalist bloggers. Some on Chinese social media have equated Israel's actions to Nazism by accusing them of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, prompting a rebuke from the German embassy in Beijing. The stabbing of a family member of an Israeli embassy employee in Beijing has also added to the unease. All this may not be a good look for China when it's trying to engage the Israeli government. Given the uncertainties, why is China getting involved? One reason is its economic interests in the Middle East, which would be endangered if the conflict widens. Beijing is now heavily dependent on foreign imports for oil, and analysts estimate about half of that comes from the Gulf. Middle Eastern countries have increasingly become important players in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a cornerstone of its foreign and economic policy. But another reason is the conflict presents a golden opportunity for Beijing to burnish its reputation. China believes that ""standing up for the Palestinians resonates with Arab countries, Muslim-majority countries and large portions of the Global South"", pointed out Dr Murphy. The war has erupted at a time when China is presenting itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Since the start of the year, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US ""hegemonic"" leadership. Officially, China has refrained from attacking the US for its support of Israel. But at the same time state media is ""ginning up the nationalist response… tying what's happening in the Middle East with the US support of Israel,"" noted Dr Murphy. Chinese military newspaper PLA Daily accused the US of ""adding fuel to the fire"" - the same rhetoric Beijing has used to criticise Washington for helping Kyiv in the Ukraine war. The state-run, English language newspaperThe Global Times published a cartoonof Uncle Sam with bloodstained hands. One view among observers is that Beijing is contrasting its position against the US so it can lower its Western rival's global standing. But by not explicitly condemning Hamas, China also risks undermining its own position. There are challenges China faces in its long-term ambitions. One is how it can square its diplomatic position with its own track record. While it expresses solidarity with Muslim-majority nations and opposes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, Beijing remains accused of committing rights abuses and genocide of the Uyghur Muslim minority, as well as forced assimilation in Tibet. Observers say that this would probably not be an issue for the Arab world, given the strong relations China has built with them. The bigger problem is Beijing risks being seen as superficial in its engagement, or even worse, capitalising on the Israel-Hamas conflict to advance its own interests. China assumes that ""by saying you support Palestine you'll score points with Arab countries, and that is a cookie-cutter approach,"" said Dr Fulton, noting there is not some unified voice among Arab states on the highly divisive issue. Mr Wang has claimed China only seeks peace for the Middle East and has ""no selfish interests on the Palestinian question"". The challenge will be to convince the world this is true.

FBI director warns antisemitism in US reaching 'historic levels'Published31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Antisemitism in the US is reaching ""historic levels"" in the wake of violence in Israel and Gaza, FBI Director Christopher Wray has warned. Speaking to a senate panel on Tuesday, Mr Wray said 60% of all religious-based hate crimes targeted Jewish people. He added that the figure had likely increased amid anger caused by the ongoing violence in Gaza. Other countries, including the UK and France, have also warned of a recent major uptick in antisemitic incidents. ""This is a threat that is reaching, in some way, sort of historic levels,"" Mr Wray told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He added that although Jews make up only about 2.4% of the US public, they account for about 60% of all religious-based hate crimes. ""The Jewish community is targeted by terrorists really across the spectrum,"" he testified. ""This is not a time for panic, but it is a time for vigilance,"" Mr Wray continued. ""We shouldn't stop conducting our daily lives - going to schools, houses of worship, and so forth - but we should be vigilant."" Officials across the US and in other countries have noted a major increase in threats to Jewish people. On Tuesday, New York officials questioned a person after threats were made against Jewish pupils at Cornell University. On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities. Offering examples of the threat faced by the Jewish community, Mr Wray cited a man who was arrested in Texas last week for trying to build a bomb and posting about his support for killing Jews, and another man who was arrested in Illinois for killing a six-year-old Muslim boy. The security chief was appearing before the senate alongside Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, where the pair offered an analysis of the threat facing the US as the conflict continues. Mr Wray said that the terror threat to Americans has been ""elevated throughout 2023"", but has risen again ""to a whole other level,"" after the 7 October Hamas attack. He added that he was concerned that extremists will ""draw inspiration"" from the Hamas attack on 7 October. ""The actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we haven't seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate years ago,"" he warned senators.",2023-10-31T23:25:22.000Z

"In Kibbutz Be'eri, a broken promise to keep Israelis safePublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Kibbutz Be'eri - three miles from Gaza - never felt like the frontline of a conflict. It looks like one now. Its empty streets are a canvas of rage. In the house where seven members of Gilad Korngold's family were taken hostage by Hamas, it's hard to find any sign or scrap of family life. Machine-gun fire has gouged holes across the walls; rooms are collapsed and gutted by fire; bullets have made lacework of the metal doors. ""Look at this!"" Gilad cries, holding back tears, as we walk inside. ""How they hate us."" The safe-room door held fast against the bullets, but the steel shutters outside were blown open, and his family has gone. Among them are his son Tal, daughter-in-law Adi, his eight-year-old grandson Naveh and three-year-old granddaughter Yahel. It's the first time he's seen the house, which belongs to Adi's parents, since the attack. ""It'll take generations to rebuild [the kibbutz], if they build a new one,"" he told me. ""I think a lot of people will not return."" What was broken here was not just the houses, but the promise Israel made to its people that it could keep them safe, even three miles from a territory run by a group committed to Israel's destruction. ""It was an illusion,"" said Gilad. ""For 25 years, a long illusion. This is what everybody thought: we were safe here, we were strong. But after this happened, I hope somebody will wake up and start another strategy."" Standing in the empty house, the twin pressures on Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are clear. Both Mr Netanyahu and his armed forces have a tough task ahead to rebuild trust in Israel's ability to protect its people. At the same time, public pressure is growing on the government to secure the return of more than 200 hostages held in Gaza, including Gilad's son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren. With backroom negotiations reportedly continuing, Hamas has suggested it could release the hostages in return for all Palestinian prisoners held in Israel's jails. Many relatives, including Gilad, say that Israel should do whatever it takes. But the man Israel holds responsible for this attack - the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar - was himself released in a prisoner exchange deal 12 years ago. Mr Netanyahu faces a difficult decision: whether or not to gamble with the country's future security in order to get the hostages out now. He has already facedchallenging conversations with the families of some hostagesover Israel's intense bombardment of Gaza, insisting that there is no conflict between the government's two priorities of destroying Hamas and protecting the hostages. ""The key is the degree of pressure,"" he told the families last week. ""The greater the pressure, the greater the chances."" But many families need convincing. Gilad said he and his family had sat up all night last week when Israel escalated its air strikes on Gaza, watching for any news of the hostages there.  It was ""a terrible night"", he said. Public attitudes seem to be shifting behind the hostage families. More people are joining the rallies organised by them after a widespread media campaign. And a poll by a major Israeli paper just before the ground invasion of Gaza suggested that less than a third of people supported it, down from more than two-thirds a week before. During that time, Hamas released four hostages, drip-feeding them out two by two. The unspoken message planted in many minds here was that there could be more. But early indications suggest that public opinion on whether to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange is deeply divided. The government's war aims have sparked a startling national unity over the past few weeks. Could the methods used to achieve them prove more divisive? At the families' memorial site in Tel Aviv, a new clock is ticking up the hours of the hostages' captivity. Its bright digits tick on through daytime speeches and candlelit vigils relentlessly. Around it, posters of those taken hostage by Hamas paper every wall - frozen, along with their families, in the final messages or moments from three weeks ago. Meanwhile, Israel has changed irrevocably. In Be'eri, the sounds of Israel's continued bombardment of Gaza land in the empty streets every minute or two. Cradled in the ashy scraps of garden, Gilad spots his grandson's football - preserved untouched beneath a layer of gritty soot. The buried treasure of an earlier life.",2023-10-31T22:10:55.000Z

Jabalia: Israel air strike reportedly kills dozens at Gaza refugee campPublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An Israeli air strike is reported to have killed dozens of people at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 50 people were killed and 150 wounded. But a nearby hospital said it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead. Pictures showed several large craters, surrounded by shattered buildings. The Israeli military said the strike killed a senior Hamas commander and ""underground terror infrastructure"" beneath buildings collapsed afterwards. It added that a ""large number of terrorists"" from Hamas's Central Jabalia Battalion who had been with the commander at the time were also killed. Israeli tanks and troops, meanwhile, continued to advance towards some of northern Gaza's most populated areas, including Jabalia. Israel has said it is the ""second phase"" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage. Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel. Tuesday's air strike in Jabalia caused a huge explosion that destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the refugee camp, where before the war 116,000 people were living in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles). Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was ""an earthquake"". ""I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,"" he told AFP news agency. Video footage and photos showed hundreds of people searching the wreckage afterwards. ""We're filling bags with children,"" cried one man, holding up a small white cloth bag covered in blood. AFP reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble. A long line of body bags were laid outside the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia. Its surgical director told the BBC's International editor Jeremy Bowen that it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead, and that the majority were children and women. Dr Mohamed el-Ron also said there were severely wounded people needing complex surgery who had to be transferred ""under fire"" to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Médecins Sans Frontières quoted one of its nurses at Al-Shifa, Mohammed Hawajreh, as saying: ""Young children arrived at the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns. They came without their families. Many were screaming and asking for their parents."" Later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had a carried out a ""wide-scale strike on terrorists and terror infrastructure belonging to the Central Jabaliya Battalion"" and killed its commander, Ibrahim Biari. ""The strike damaged Hamas's command and control in the area, as well as its ability to direct military activity against IDF soldiers operating throughout the Gaza Strip,"" it added. ""A large number of terrorists who were with Biari were killed. Underground terror infrastructure embedded beneath the buildings, used by the terrorists, also collapsed after the strike."" IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari did not directly address the reported civilian casualties at a briefing, but he said: ""The Hamas terrorists continue to use civilian population as protective armour. This is intentional and devastatingly barbaric."" A Hamas spokesman was quoted by Al Arabiya TV as denying that a commander had been in Jabalia, accusing the IDF of ""false and unfounded talk"" intended to ""justify its heinous crime"". The IDF also said that its ground forces had killed about 50 Hamas fighters during an operation to secure a military stronghold in western Jabalia that served as a training centre for the 7 October attack and contained tunnels used as a passageway to the Mediterranean coast. Two Israeli soldiers were killed during the battle, according to Adm Hagari. Hamas's military wing said its fighters had hit four Israeli military vehicles within southern Gaza, fired at tanks and bulldozers in north-west Gaza, and ambushed an Israeli unit in the north-east. Hamas and other Palestinian groups also continued to fire rockets into Israel. Four people in the coastal city of Ashdod were wounded in two attacks. Following Tuesday's strike in Jabalia, Adm Hagari once again called on all civilians in the camp and elsewhere in northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety. Hundreds of thousands of people have not heeded the order, which the IDF first issued on 13 October. The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients and medical staff. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools and other public buildings. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said it was extremely concerned by reports of air strikes in the vicinity of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital over the last two days. The hospital, which is located south of Gaza City, is the main cancer centre in the Gaza Strip. The BBC verified a video circulated on social media on Monday in which smoke can be seen outside the hospital and an explosion can be heard. The Israeli military told the BBC that it had not stuck the hospital, but it did not deny that there may have been strikes in the area. Dr Richard Brennan, the WHO's regional emergency director, also warned that the wider health situation in Gaza was ""essentially catastrophic"", with 8,525 deaths from trauma reported by the health ministry, over a third of hospitals not functioning, and the rest overwhelmed by patients. ""Anaesthetics and painkillers are running short, so doctors are doing procedures without the right medicine and equipment, and patients are suffering incredible because of that,"" he told the BBC. Dr Brennan also said the UN had already started to see infectious diseases such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections among the 1.4 million displaced people living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. The US said on Monday night that it was confident there would be an increase in humanitarian aid entering southern Gaza via Egypt's Rafah border crossing in the coming days. In recent days, there has been a small rise in the deliveries of food, water and medicine being allowed in, but UN agencies said the promised 100 lorryloads a day were a fraction of what was needed. Israel is not permitting deliveries of fuel - crucial to run hospitals and bakeries, and for purifying and pumping water - because it says it could be used by Hamas for military purposes. The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf said he saw hundreds of people queuing for a small bottle of clean drinking water from a UN tanker outside a hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis on Tuesday. A father who had to queue for six hours to get five Arabic flatbreads to feed his family told him: ""This is not enough.""",2023-10-31T22:06:34.000Z

Israel Gaza: Father loses 11 family members in one blastPublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"There is no mistaking what he sees as he climbs across the rubble. The fabric lies bright against the grey rubble. Khalil Khader picks up the dusty and tattered child's pyjamas and is instantly overtaken by memories. The toddler in her pyjamas. Rosa, his daughter, 18 months old, the baby of the family. Khalil shows a video on his phone. Rosa wears the same blue nightwear and is holding the hands of two older cousins. The three of them dance in a circle. The video was filmed in slow motion, so it seems as if the children are swaying in a gentle breeze. They are smiling. It is playtime and their lives have not yet been overtaken by war. Khalil is a quiet spoken man, aged 36, a computer engineer at Al-Najjar hospital in Rafah, and the father of four young children: Ibrahim, aged nine; Amal, aged five; Kinan, two-and-a-half, and Rosa the last born. Khalil steps carefully across the rubble. The house is only a few minutes walk from the hospital. There is now a mound of masonry and metal, household objects and some children's toys. A small drum. A toy piano. On the night the missile struck - October 20 - Khalil was working at the hospital. ""A massive bomb exploded,"" he told one of my BBC colleagues who went with him to the scene of the attack. ""My neighbours were coming to the hospital. So I asked, 'Where was the bombing?' And they told me, 'It was around your house.' I had to run to the location to check on the family. I tried calling but no one was answering. And as you can see… the whole house was bombed."" Eleven members of his family were killed. They included his four children, his two sisters, his 70-year-old father, his brother and his sister-in-law, and their two daughters. They were wrapped in white shrouds in a courtyard of the hospital. His wife was badly wounded. She is being treated for burns and other injuries sustained when the house collapsed. Khalil had known war before in Gaza. The small strip of land - with a total land area of just 141 sq miles (365 sq km) - has seen relentless conflict over decades. Such was the legacy of conflict that he worried about raising a family there. ""I remember in the 2014 war, my wife was pregnant,"" he recalls, ""and our neighbours were bombed. She was in her seventh month and almost fell down the stairs from the blast. And I was thinking, how can I bring children into this life?"" But he imagined that a better life might be possible for them. ""I had a dream for each of my kids. Ibrahim was first in his school and I dreamed about seeing him as a doctor one day.

Anti-war protesters interrupt Antony Blinken at US Senate hearingPublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Protesters calling for a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Numerous people stood in the crowd and repeatedly yelled ""Ceasefire now!"" Secretary Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin testified about the White House's $106bn (£87.4bn) national security funding request. It includes $14.3bn to support Israel's military efforts against Hamas. Standing up one by one, protesters waited for Mr Blinken to begin his testimony before shouting over him again. The Secretary of State paused and lawmakers were forced to suspend the hearing several times. Capitol Police quickly escorted the demonstrators from the room. Police said 12 people had been arrested for illegally protesting inside the Dirksen Senate Office Building. Some of those who interrupted the proceedings were affiliated with the anti-war group CODEPINK, which has also called for the US to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. Many protesters wore pink and held signs reading ""No to the siege of Gaza"", as they called for the US to stop sending funds to Israel. CODEPINK confirmed that some of its members were arrested. Some had painted their hands red ""to symbolise blood"", the group said. Mr Blinken acknowledged the protesters and ""the passions expressed in this room"" at the end of his statement. ""All of us are committed to the protection of civilian life. All of us know the suffering that is taking place as we speak, all of us are determined to see it end,"" he said. He added, however, that it was imperative that the US stand with its allies. Mr Blinken and Mr Austin are lobbying for lawmakers to support President Joe Biden's national security package, which also includes: As support for Ukraine has diminished among conservative voters, Congressional Republicans have increasingly said they want to consider Israel as a separate funding request. Mike Johnson, the newly elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, has proposed legislation that would send $14.3bn in emergency funding to Israel. It is not connected to the White House's other national security priorities and would strip the same amount from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service, the agency in charge of collecting federal taxes. The new Speaker defended his bill on Fox News and said Americans would ""say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent over there is in our national interest and is a more immediate need than IRS agents"". The White House said Republicans were using the crisis to ""help the wealthy and big corporations cheat on their taxes"". ""Politicising our national security interests is a non-starter,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. Rep Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat with strong ties to Israel, said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by Mr Johnson's bill and said his ""political games are offensive to all pro-Israel Americans"". The US has a long history of supporting Israel. It has provided the country with $158bn since World War Two, largely in military aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. The White House and senior American officials have reaffirmed US support for Israel numerous times since Hamas's 7 October attack. ""We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack,"" Mr Biden said in its immediate aftermath. In recent weeks, the president's tone has changed slightly. He has maintained his support for Israel but also cautioned its leaders to follow international law and respond responsibly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza affecting Palestinian civilians. Israel says Hamas's incursion and ongoing rocket attacks since 7 October have killed 1,400 people. At least 239 people were also taken hostage by Hamas. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,500 people have been killed since Israel's bombardment began.",2023-10-31T21:01:06.000Z

Jack Lew confirmed as new US Ambassador to IsraelPublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The US Senate has confirmed former treasury secretary Jack Lew as the new US Ambassador to Israel. President Joe Biden nominated Mr Lew, an Orthodox Jew who held top posts in prior administrations, in September. The White House urged Congress to confirm him quickly after Hamas's attack, as ""high-level diplomatic representation"" is ""critical"". The Senate voted largely on party lines, with Democrats and two Republicans backing Mr Biden's choice. Mr Lew needed a simple majority in the 100-member Senate for his appointment to be confirmed. Raised in an observant Jewish family in New York, Mr Lew, 68, has maintained a low profile in Washington, D.C., despite a career that boasts several important postings. Under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the longtime civil servant led the Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the president's budget requests. Mr Lew later served for a year as President Obama's White House chief of staff, one of the most influential cabinet positions. A budget expert, he was thenappointed as treasury secretaryin 2013 and served in that post until 2017. That appointment process was memorable for thecriticism of his illegible loopy signature, as it would appear on American currency if he became secretary. He quickly adopted a more traditional sign-off. Mr Lew began his career in politics in 1973. He worked for eight years as the primary domestic adviser to House Speaker Tip O'Neill, an iconic and powerful Democrat. Mr Lew has previously spoken in support of a two-state solution. He openly criticised Israel and its conservative prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, while working under President Obama. He also defended the US's 2016 decision not to veto the UN Security Council condemnation of Israeli settlements on occupied land. During his recent nomination hearing, however, Lew said he has ""worried deeply about the survival of the State of Israel"" throughout his life. Growing up, he said, his family believed deeply in the creation and defence of a Jewish homeland. That background and Hamas's attack informed Mr Lew's view of the post's important responsibility, he said. ""At this moment, there is no greater mission than to be asked to strengthen the ties between the United States and the State of Israel and to work toward peace in a region that has known so much war and destruction,"" he said in his opening statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr Lew said that as ambassador he would work ""to end the horrific attacks by Hamas"" and make sure Israel has all ""it needs to defend itself"". He said he would strive to help American captives return home. He also said he would do everything in his power to stop the conflict from expanding, aid innocent Palestinians trapped in Gaza, and stymie the influence of Iran, which he called ""a threat to regional stability and to Israel's existence"". Senate Democrats had stressed their desire to get Mr Lew into the ambassador's post, which was vacated in July, as quickly as possible. Republicans, however, expressed reservations and in some cases hostility to the appointment. Mr Lew sparred with Republicans during his hearing over his work on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. The agreement, which included the UK, the US and several European countries, limited Tehran's nuclear programme. In return, Western countries and the UN agreed to eventually lift sanctions and unfreeze Iranian funds. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he had ""reservations"" over Mr Lew because of his involvement in the deal as President Obama's Treasury Secretary: ""Holding hands with Iran under the table doesn't work for me."" Republicans have long opposed the Iran Nuclear Deal, arguing it did not do enough to ensure Tehran would not develop a nuclear weapon and gave the government too much financial support. Donald Trump famously pulled the US out the agreement early in his administration. Other Senate Republicans claimed the deal had allowed Iran to fund groups like Hamas. A few also suggested Mr Lew had misled Congress when testifying about the agreement as secretary. Mr Lew disputed the claims, arguing that all Iran gained was access to ""their money that we had frozen"". Iran agreed to the terms but was unhappy with the outcome, he said.",2023-10-31T20:28:51.000Z

"Natalie Raanan, a teen taken hostage by Hamas, is home in ChicagoPublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","A US teenager who was taken hostage by Hamas while visiting family in Israel is back home in Chicago, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest confirmed on Monday. Natalie Raanan and her mother, Judith, were taken by Hamas on 7 October in the surprise raid on Israel that killed 1,400 people. They were freed on 20 October for ""humanitarian reasons"", Hamas said. There are no details yet on when Judith will return to the US. ""I am relieved to see Natalie back home in Chicago,"" said Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest. ""Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness."" The Raanans were taken hostage while celebrating Natalie's recent high school graduation and the 85th birthday of her grandmother, Tamar Ranaan, who survived the Hamas attack. Before Natalie returned to Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, she and her mother were taken to a military base in the centre of Israel. Judith Raanan had been suffering poor health and was receiving treatment from the Red Cross, CNN reported. Qatar helped broker the release of the mother and daughter. After hearing about their release, Natalie's half-brother, Ben Raanan, told the BBC he felt an ""overwhelming sense of gratitude to the large community of people around the world who have put my sister at the forefront of their thoughts, of their prayers, of all religions and all beliefs"". At the time of their release to Israeli custody, US President Joe Biden said US officials have been ""working around-the-clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas"". So far, four out of the 239 people kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October have been released, and the Ranaans are the only Americans. An Israeli-German woman who was believed to have been taken, Shani Louk,was confirmed dead on Monday. Violence has exploded in the region since Hamas swept through multiple kibbutz settlements and a music festival in the shock attack. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.",2023-10-31T16:29:03.000Z

Keir Starmer says he understands calls for Gaza ceasefirePublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he understands calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but argued it was not the ""correct position"" at the moment. More than 60 Labour MPs have called for a ceasefire, but Sir Keir insisted his stance of calling for a humanitarian pause was ""the only credible approach"". He said a pause would allow aid to get in to Gaza and for hostages to leave. He argued that a ceasefire would leave Hamas's infrastructure intact, enabling them to carry out future attacks. Addressing an audience in London, the Labour leader had sought to quell the growing tensions in his party over the conflict. Mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and 15 frontbenchers are among those who have diverged from the official party line on the issue. At least 250 councillors have also called for a ceasefire, with around 30 councillors resigning from the party over the leadership's position on the war. Meanwhile, Andy McDonaldhas been suspended as a Labour MP, over what the party described as ""deeply offensive"" comments at a pro-Palestinian rally. Following his speech, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked if Labour frontbenchers diverging from the party position would be sacked. He said the party was unified on wanting to see an ""alleviation of this awful situation"" and that he would ""engage sensitively"" with his colleagues' concerns, but did not say that they would be disciplined for breaking with the party line. Sir Keir said his approach to the conflict had been driven by a desire to defend Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks and the rights of Palestinians ""caught in the crossfire"". ""While I understand calls for a ceasefire, at this stage I do not believe that is the correct position now. ""Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately."" He said a humanitarian pause was ""the only credible approach that has any chance of achieving what we all want to see in Gaza - the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering"". Asked if he believed Israel was abiding by international law, Sir Keir said that would be decided by lawyers in due course and it would be ""unwise"" for politicians to make premature pronouncements. As the Labour leader left Chatham House, where he was giving the speech, his car was mobbed by a group of pro-Palestine demonstrators. Police cleared a path for the car as the protestors shouted and drummed on the windows. By not backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours. They are typically implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions,according to the United Nations. As the Labour leader was defending his position, both Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and London Mayor Sadiq Khan reiterated their calls for a ceasefire. Mr Sarwar also saidpast comments made by Sir Keirhad caused hurt to Muslims and ""any peace loving citizen"". Speaking to BBC London, Mr Khan didn't directly criticised his party's leader but said: ""I believe in a de-escalation of the violence not escalation, that's why I'm calling for a ceasefire."" Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, dismissed Sir Keir's speech as ""fine words"" adding: ""The truth is is that Starmer's support for more war, more bombing and more Palestinian deaths is wholly out of touch with his own party and the public at large, who overwhelmingly back an immediate ceasefire. ""Those calls will only get louder."" Following the speech, former party leader Jeremy Corbynposted on X:""I wonder, if the dust ever settles, whether opponents of a ceasefire will look back and reflect on the cost of their inhumanity. We need a ceasefire, now."" Human rights group Amnesty International were also critical, accusing the Labour leader of failing to show ""the clear and principled leadership that this decades-old crisis needs"". They said calls for a pause were ""vague and unclear"" and that Sir Keir should instead back an immediate ceasefire. On Monday Andy McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended as a Labour MP over comments he made in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. The MP for Middlesbrough told protesters on Saturday: ""We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty."" He said his words were intended as ""a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings"" in the region. But the phrase ""between the river and the sea"" - which refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - is interpreted by some, including Israel and most Jewish groups, as implicitly calling for the destruction of Israel. This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself. A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend ""were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety"". However, the suspension has outraged the left, who argue Mr McDonald's words had been misrepresented, as well as the Labour Muslim Network. But the bigger danger for Sir Keir is that by doubling down on rejecting calls for a ceasefire, some shadow ministers beyond the left come under pressure from members and communities and decide to resign, sparking a potential chain reaction. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Paul Bristow has been sacked from his government role as a ministerial aide,after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.",2023-10-31T16:03:36.000Z

Israeli President Isaac Herzog defends Gaza operationPublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli President Isaac Herzog has strongly defended his country's military operations in Gaza. In a BBC interview, he insisted Israel was putting ""a huge focus"" on reducing civilian casualties. Asked about UN figures that nearly 70% of more than 8,000 deaths were women and children, he said no-one wanted them to pay the price. But he said Israel was fighting ""a bitter enemy which had carried out shocking atrocities"". On 7 October, Hamas launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 230 people hostage. Mr Herzog said Israel had to destroy Hamas's infrastructure. He accused the group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the UK and many other Western governments, of firing rockets from inside people's homes. Israel attacked, he said, when it saw ""terrorists who are trying to attack us or launch things against us"". Israel's Arab neighbours, including countries who have signed peace treaties with the Jewish state, have warned that rising civilian casualties in Gaza would push the region into a much wider conflagration. ""We listen and we respect them,"" he said, but added that ""first and foremost, we have to take care of our citizens"". Asked about almost-daily warnings from Israel's closest ally, the United States, to exercise caution, he retorted that Israel was being cautious and it ""couldn't be measured in numbers"". The president also said Israel was in daily touch with the US, UK and other Western allies about bringing in more humanitarian aid to Gaza. The US has said 100 trucks a day will soon be allowed to enter southern Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has repeatedly warned that ""only a trickle"" was getting through in the midst of Gaza's ""humanitarian catastrophe"". The president denied reports that Israel was still bombing southern Gaza, where the UN says more than a million Gazans have fled after Israel repeatedly warned them to leave the northern part of the territory. On Monday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini warned ""no place was safe in Gaza"". ""Truly speaking, the safe zone in the south is a safe zone,"" Mr Herzog said, denying reports from the UN that even its own shelters had come under fire. ""We were operating according to the rules of international law to ask people to move out to the safe zone, we gave them alerts, we're helping them to move out."" Asked about Israeli air strikes close to Gaza's hospitals, the president emphatically stated that hospitals themselves would not be targeted. Turning to the question of more than 200 hostages, including dozens of nationalities, held by Hamas, Mr Herzog said it was Israel's top priority, as well as the international community's, to bring them home. But he said Israel had still not seen any real proposals worth considering in the intense negotiations mediated by the Gulf state of Qatar. Diplomats briefed on the talks told the BBC last week that the negotiations had been moving forward until Israel expanded its ground operations. Mr Herzog described his meetings with the families of the hostages as ""the most difficult meetings I've ever had in my life"". And he spoke of Israel's profound trauma. ""My nation is in deep agony, the people of Israel are in deep, unprecedented agony, we are mourning. We're a different nation in many respects, at least in this given moment,"" he said. This was also affecting how Israelis saw the future, he said. He would not be drawn on how Israel sees the future of Gaza once the war ends. ""Right now, the psychological, emotional debate is so strong in Israel in terms of how we move forward."" ""This was a wake-up call on 7 October... reality shattered our beliefs. We see such atrocities and we ask, can we trust anybody?""",2023-10-31T16:00:12.000Z

Israeli hostage relative criticises Met Police over poster removalPublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A relative of an Israeli man who is among at least 230 hostages abducted by Hamas has criticised the Metropolitan Police for removing posters calling for their release. The hostages were taken during the 7 October attacks in which at least 1,400 Israelis were killed. ""Kidnapped"" posters have been put up across London raise public awareness. The Met said the posters were removed in Edgware to ""avoid any further increase in community tension"". A spokesperson for the force said the posters were put up late on Saturday. The force received two calls from residents about the posters being put on a business's shutters. ""They believed the posters were put on these specific shutters as a retaliation for comments about the conflict between Israel and Hamas that were made on social media by a person associated with the business,"" the spokesperson said. ""It appears printouts of those comments may also have been put up next to the posters."" The spokesperson said those who reported the posters feared they would ""escalate an already tense situation"". There have been a number of incidents of people tearing down the posters. Adam Ma'anit, whose cousinTsachi Idan was abducted by Hamas militants on 7 October after they shot and killed his 18-year-old daughter, says he feels a ""wave of despair"" when the posters are torn down. ""Seeing police doing it, whatever the context, just made me feel even worse. There is no hate on those posters, they are just being used to highlight the plight of the hostages as the news cycle has long moved past the atrocities of October 7,"" he said. The Met spokesperson said the force did not wish to limit the rights of anyone to raise awareness of those kidnapped but ""we do have a responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues escalating"". Mr Ma'anit said those who tear down the posters were ""silencing"" those attempting raise awareness about the hostages. ""For the police to be party to that is deeply distressing,"" he added.

"British Jews are 'full of fear, like I've never seen before'Published31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","""The Jewish community at the moment is full of dread, full of fear, like I've never seen before,"" says Justin Cohen, news editor and co-publisher of Jewish News. He talks of this anxiety playing out with a backdrop of intense trauma caused by the Hamas killings and kidnappings on 7 October. More than 70% of British Jews have family living in Israel and 90% have visited the country at least once, according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research. But the fact the Metropolitan Police reported a 15-fold increase in antisemitic incidents over the past three weeks, when compared with the same period last year, means hatred has been at the forefront of the minds of many. ""If people who are so boiling over with rage in these demos see Jewish people as inextricably linked with Israel, they will inevitably target those Jewish people. The fears are never-ending at this point,"" says Mr Cohen. The demonstrations in the UK, attended by tens of thousands of people calling for an end to Israel's bombing of Gaza, have been viewed by him as hostile, threatening and unsettling. In the most recent marches, he points to some being filmed calling for ""intifada"", the term given to violent Palestinian uprisings. ""We've seen calls for an intifada where, in the past, suicide bombings have targeted civilians, in cafes and restaurants and in nightclubs. Whether it's one person saying this stuff or 10 or 10,000, the chilling effect on British Jews is the same,"" says Mr Cohen Although protest organisers insist the focus has been on Israel's massive bombing campaign in Gaza - and that antisemitism has not played a part - that is not how many British Jews see the marches. ""It's chilling. It's upsetting. And it makes you feel unsafe in the place that you call home,"" says Londoner Benjamin Bell, 41, of the size of the pro-Palestinian gatherings. In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, Mr Bellwrote a blog post that went viralin which he publicly expressed his Jewish identity, after years of being cautious about doing so, because of concerns about antisemitism. He talked of wearing a star of David pendant for the first time since his bar mitzvah. Three weeks later, Mr Bell says he is once again having to weigh up whether he wears that pendant depending on the situation. ""Unfortunately a lot of social media content is stirring up hatred and making people feel that the place that they call home may not be safe,"" he says. Mr Bell talks of Jewish friends feeling anxious about antisemitism, particularly at work where they are worried about expressing support for Israel. Although  he was born and raised in the UK, he says he was profoundly affected by the killings and kidnappings in Israel. ""The Holocaust cast a long shadow over the Jewish spirit and we feel that the state of Israel provides that sanctity, that safe haven, that last resort - it goes to the very heart of my being,"" he says. It is why Mr Bell says he feels unnerved by the demonstrations and particularly by the use of slogans like ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,"" referring to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. He feels it can only mean the destruction of the Israeli state in its current form. The Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which helps organise the demonstrations, contests this interpretation of that particular chant, saying the slogan refers to ""the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice"". Activists also point to the make up of the pro-Palestinian protests as evidence they are not antisemitic. ""There are hundreds of Jews on the demonstration. In fact, I've never experienced the more beautiful energy. I saw no hate, just a kind of a wonderful caring for humanity,"" says Alexei Sayle who is both Jewish and also a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. The 71-year-old actor, comedian and author - whose mother was Jewish and grew up in an Orthodox, Yiddish-speaking household - has been a long-time campaigner for Palestinian rights. It is a contingent that represents a small minority of British Jews. Mr Sayle says Jews who choose to publicly criticise Israel's actions sometimes feel a sense of guilt and often pay a price for their stance. ""It's cost me friendships, it's made relationships with people difficult, sometimes it's made me feel uncomfortable to speak out for the Palestinian people. It's painful,"" Mr Sayle says. Referring to the ""river to the sea"" chant, he insists it is not meant to mean the eradication of Jews in the region. But while he fully understands the need for Jews to have somewhere they feel safe, he acknowledges that he, and other campaigners, are calling for a change in the way Israel sees itself as a Jewish country. ""I think that to have a state called Israel, which has a right of return and is a state in which Jews live in beautiful harmony with everybody else, is fine,"" Mr Sayle says. ""But if that safe haven depends on brutalising other people, stealing other people's land, then it's not a safe haven,"" he says, challenging Israel's assertion that its actions are necessary to maintain security. While there is debate over the nature and intent of some slogans at demonstrations, a huge rise in incidents of anti-Jewish hate in the UK of the past few weeks is irrefutable. Similar spikes in antisemitic incidents accompanied Israel-Gaza violence in 2009, 2014 and 2021. ""We are unfortunately used to it to some extent, but we do feel that we should be feeling safer here in England, children should feel comfortable to come to school in the morning and not get harassed,"" says Abraham Schechter, headteacher of the Beis Chinuch Lebonos Jewish Girls School in north London. Staff and students arrived at school one morning to find red paint had been thrown at the front gates. Another Jewish school close by was also vandalised in a similar way. ""Everybody's very tense, very worried, especially the pupils. We had discussions telling them not to loiter around on the streets and just to go straight home [after school], but they should not suffer here for what is happening over there,"" Mr Schechter says. There are concerns that the longer the conflict goes on, the more intensely and profoundly it will affect British Jews right across the spectrum.

Anguished UK Palestinians grieve for loved ones in GazaPublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"It was 04:30 on Sunday 22 October when Ahmed Alnaouq suddenly woke. He normally slept well, but he'd had a feeling something was wrong. He glanced at his phone and saw lots of WhatsApp messages from friends back home in Gaza - all now erased and replaced with ""This message has been deleted."" Mr Alnaouq, confused, messaged one of them back from his home in London. The response - ""Are you good?"" with no explanation for the deleted texts - made him feel more uneasy. Ahmed called, and his friend broke the news. Mr Alnaouq's father Nasri, three sisters, two brothers, a cousin, and 13 young nieces and nephews - 20 members of his family - had been killed by an Israeli air strike. He felt something worse than devastation - a feeling so awful he didn't have a word for it. His father, he said, was the person he ""loved most in his life"". Most of the family had lived together in his father's home, where Mr Alnaouq himself was born. His three sisters had moved in temporarily for their own safety, because the house was south of the Wadi Gaza river. But shortly after ordering civilians to shelter in the south, the Israeli military continued to target the area. It said it was striking a series of Hamas targets. ""Israel instructed people to go there because it was safer,"" Mr Alnaouq said. ""Then they bombed it."" Ahmed Alnaouq moved to the UK four years ago after getting a scholarship to study for a master's degree at the University of Leeds. He now runs the organisation We Are Not Numbers, which pairs Palestinian writers with mentors in the West. He hadn't been able to see his father since leaving Gaza. ""I always said to myself that if something happened to my father before I was able to see him again, I would never forgive myself."" For Mr Alnaouq, he has not just had his family ripped away - he has also been denied the ability to grieve. ""Usually when someone loses a family member, they will be able to go and attend their funeral, kiss them goodbye, see their faces for the last time,"" he said. ""But they are thousands of miles away. Still, after a week, nine of them are under rubble. No-one can take their bodies out from under the rubble. I don't know how to describe it, but I feel like my heart is torn."" He is one of many British Palestinians who, despite being 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Gaza, are feeling the war intensely. Those whose relatives have survived the bombings are trying to track their family members' movements remotely, and to push for action from those in power. They're watching the war unfold on TV and their phones, while trying to remain hopeful that their loved ones are safe. Basma Ghalayini, 40, is one such person. She is currently dealing with the intense anxiety of not knowing how her relatives are faring. Ms Ghalayini is in Manchester, but her brother and sister travelled to Gaza in September to visit their parents who work there. When Hamas launched their attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Ms Ghalayini's mother was immediately concerned about the potential dangers to Basma's sister, who has a health condition and is reliant on certain medication. ""So she quickly took [my sister] to the Egyptian border and headed to Cairo. They made it through. The borders closed the very next day."" Ms Ghalayini's brother Mohammed and their father stayed in Gaza, moving to Khan Younis in the south when Israel gave its evacuation order. Aside from the risk of deadly rockets, water and food supplies are running extremely low. The UN has warned that civil order is ""starting to break down"". Power in Khan Younis is also extremely limited. Ms Ghalayini said Mohammed had had to queue for five hours to charge his phone from a car battery. For this reason, she said, she doesn't want to waste her brother's battery by texting him a lot. Instead, she asked him to switch on his ""last seen"" status on WhatsApp. But that connection is fragile. On Friday evening, Israel launched strikes of a scale and intensity never seen before. Connectivity from Gaza was cut off almost completely. Their loved ones in the UK waited anxiously for Gaza's internet to return. It was then another 42 hours before Ms Ghalayini finally heard from Mohammed. While this is the most intense escalation of the conflict in recent years, for Palestinians and the diaspora, the pain they're feeling now is not new. Ms Ghalayini told me her six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son already know what bombs are. ""It's all part of being Palestinian,"" she explains. ""Any Palestinian child will know, because it's part of our lives."" But when her daughter asks if her uncle and grandfather are safe, she tells her, ""Yes, they're safe."" ""I have to,"" she said. ""She'll just get worried."" Karim Ali's colleagues literally bear the scars of Israel's previous attacks on Gaza. The 24-year-old from London works with a para-cycling team based in Gaza called the Gaza Sunbirds. Everyone in the team lost their limbs in previous bombardments. He said that he had been talking recently to one of the athletes who had been gathering body parts from those killed in the current violence. ""We're talking about an amputee on one leg having to go around to gather the body pieces of people from the building next door, because there's no one else to clear the rubble."" There's also a feeling of frustration closer to home. Ms Ghalayini said she feels let down by the UK media, including the BBC. She said she disagrees with some of its terminology, such as it sometimes referring to the ""Israel-Hamas war"". ""It's heavily misleading,"" she said, as thousands of Palestinians had been killed, including children - ""none of them affiliated with Hamas"". Mr Ali said he feels his community isn't always treated with respect by politicians or the media, citing what he sees as their tendency to make Israel's attacks on Gaza seem ""justified and targeted"". ""We're doctors, we're teachers, we're lawyers, we're politicians, we're academics, we're volunteers,"" he said. ""I came to this country to study, I started a food bank, I started a mutual aid group during the pandemic. I've contributed to the culture of this country. ""Why are we being treated like we're nothing? Why are we being dehumanised?"" But for both Ms Ghalayini and Mr Ali, the overwhelming show of support from people who've gone on marches across the country has left them with some hope. While Basma Ghalayini worries they risk being a bit of an ""echo chamber"", she said the marches help her feel ""reassured"". ""It makes me feel that there are people who are there for us, supporting us.""",2023-10-31T11:34:09.000Z

Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza tells of 'terror' for familyPublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A Welsh doctor trapped in Gaza has told how his cousin was ""murdered with her whole family"", including five children. ""Literally every hour we hear a family has been killed,"" he said. After moving five times with his wife and three children, as bombs destroyed where they were staying, he said they feel ""left alone"" by the government. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said its officials were in ""close contact"" with British nationals in Gaza. The doctor, who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted, waited with his family for three days at the Rafah crossing trying to escape, but bombs continued to fall and there was no way out. He said he was ""terrified"" they would be killed before they manage to escape. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began. The doctor and his family arrived in Gaza three days before the attacks. When the crossing border was closed, they became ""trapped"". Speaking to BBC Wales on the phone, he said the noise in the background was ""the sound of war planes, you can even hear the bombing"". ""It does intensify overnight which is more terrifying and scary."" The doctor had been visiting relatives he supports financially in an area where 80% of the population already relied on international aid. Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low, as few aid trucks are allowed in. ""We don't have anything. We lost all of our possessions. We were just moving from one place to another to find a safe place,"" the doctor said. ""For two weeks it was the same clothes for us and the children"". The family managed to get to a market a few days ago, but it was not safe. ""Thirty-three members of the same family were killed the other day in what was meant to be a safe area,"" he said, adding that has become very usual to hear. ""In every street there is a building which has been hit. I think everyone is mourning, everyone is just waiting to be killed."" Since the latest fighting began, Israel has cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack. The family have moved to the south of Gaza, as they were told it would be safer and the best place to cross the border. As they travelled, the family saw a convoy carrying nearly 100 people from north to south,two hours before a strike killed multiple people on board. ""They're targeting everything, residential buildings, schools, whole neighbourhoods have been wiped out,"" he said. The doctor contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office ""on the second day to get some help"" but said the team refused to take any details over the phone and told him ""to go online and fill a form"". ""I don't believe our government did anything to save us. We now receive regular updates via emails and WhatsApp but all of them are generic quoting media sources that Rafah crossing is still closed,"" he said. But the family remain hopeful, and said their local MP Geraint Davies has been contacting the office daily. The Swansea West MP said he has raised the family's story in an Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) briefing with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and also written a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling for a ceasefire. The doctor called for an ""immediate ceasefire"" to allow aid in, amid an ""imminent and real danger of being killed by Israeli airstrikes"". An FCDO spokesperson said the safety of British nationals remained its top priority and it was working closely with Egypt and Israel to ensure all who want to leave Gaza ""can exit via the Rafah crossing or other routes as quickly as possible"". It added: ""FCDO has been keeping in close contact with British nationals in Gaza and will continue to update them on the latest status of the crossing.''",2023-10-31T10:40:04.000Z

Reporting on Gaza: 'Sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry'Published31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The calls come whenever he can get a signal. Or whenever he can get enough electricity to charge his phone. He eats when he can find food. He travels from one scene of desolation to another. As long as he can find petrol. And Mahmoud Bassam worries about his wife and 11-month-old child because they have to move to avoid the bombing. So when he leaves home in the morning he is never sure they will be in the same place when he gets back at night. That is if he can get back. If the road is not blocked or the bombing too heavy for him to travel. In Gaza these days, Mahmoud is at the mercy of war. What it inflicts. What it can take away. Mahmoud is a dedicated chronicler of his people's agony. Ever since the conflict began over three weeks ago he has been moving between hospitals and refugee camps and - with exhausting frequency -  the scenes of explosions. Alongside the work of the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rushdi Abualouf, that of freelancers like Mahmoud has helped the BBC to convey the agony of civilians caught under relentless air strikes. When I reach him by phone after hours of trying, Mahmoud describes the emotional toll of his work. ""As hard as it is to see what I see, and as much as I'm trying to deliver this message,"" he says, ""sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry. And the only thing I can do is be silent."" Many of the journalists I know who work in war zones feel a deep helplessness as human beings faced with relentless human suffering. How do you help when there are so many to be helped? How do you do your work if you are stopping to give food or first aid? We are not aid workers or medics. But we are human beings. This is magnified for Mahmoud by his local ties. Foreign correspondents like me have the privilege of getting on a plane and going home. The memories of war might follow but we at least have physical safety as do the people we love. The Gaza Strip is a very small place -  366 sq km (141 square miles) in total land area. Mahmoud has every chance of finding someone he knows at a war scene. ""I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver what I am seeing,"" he tells me, ""but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids, try to give them water, see what they need, try to provide them with what they need."" Watching his raw footage as it arrives on our computers the team I work with are struck by his calm. Never once does he forget that the people he films and interviews are probably facing a camera for the first time in their lives, in the worst imaginable circumstances. This war is proving to be one of the most dangerous for journalists in recent times. More than 30 have been killed so far. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said those in Gaza are paying an unprecedented toll. ""This is a deadly time for journalists in Gaza,"" says Sherif Mansour, the Middle East expert of the CPJ. ""We have seen more journalists killed in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict. A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family homes, and they were forced to flee where there is no safe haven or exit."" In a close-knit community of journalists in places like Gaza it is inevitable that the loss of colleagues reverberates intimately. Yara Eid is a Palestinian journalist who grew up in Gaza. She is now living in Britain and mourning her friend Ibrahim Lafi who was killed at the beginning of the war. ""I lost my best friend Ibrahim. He was a Palestinian journalist, but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old. He was a brother. He was a best friend. He was a dreamer,"" she says. ""He was a photographer, and he loved life very much. He was the person that smiled the most. I've never seen Ibrahim not smiling in my life. He had the biggest smile whenever I saw him. ""He was the most supportive friend I've ever had. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose to show the whole world the beauty of Gaza."" Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing that not only they but their families are under threat. The Al Jazeera bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdaouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and infant grandson in an air strike. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. To those of us watching events from Jerusalem, that dedication is nothing short of extraordinary.

Israel Gaza: US rejects calls for ceasefirePublished31 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The US has rejected global calls for a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, arguing it is not the ""right answer right now"". National Security spokesperson John Kirby made the comments on Monday, suggesting instead ""pauses"" to allow aid to be delivered inside Gaza. Currently, supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for Gaza's 2.2 million residents are dangerously low. But Israel has vowed there will be no ceasefire until Hamas is dismantled. ""Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism... this will not happen,"" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. Speaking at a press briefing, Mr Kirby said he was confident more aid trucks would be able to enter Gaza via Egypt. He said the US had spoken to the Israeli government about increasing the number of lorries crossing the border each day to around 100. About 45 trucks had entered Gaza through Egypt's Rafah Crossing on Sunday, Mr Kirby said. But, he conceded more would be needed. ""We know that even that, which is a dramatic improvement over where we are right now, is still not going to be enough,"" he told the press briefing. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UN relief agency UNRWA,previously told the BBC that about 500 trucksa day had entered Gaza before the war started. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas. More than 8,300 people in Gaza have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Yinam Cohen, Israel's consul general to the Midwest, said on Monday that one woman held hostage by Hamas; Natalie Raanan, had returned home to Chicago. Last week, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly called for an immediate humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas,which was angrily dismissed by Israel. On Monday, Mr Lazzarini said the system to provide aid would ""fail unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs"". Israel began what Mr Netanyahu called the ""second stage"" of a war intended to destroy Hamas on Monday, with ground forces expanding their operations inside Gaza after three weeks of intense bombardment.",2023-10-31T04:34:16.000Z

Man pleads not guilty to murder of US Muslim boyPublished30 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An Illinois landlord has pleaded not guilty to murder and hate crimes charges in the fatal stabbing of a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy. Prosecutors say Joseph Czuba stabbed Wadea al-Fayoume to death and seriously wounded his mother in the attack. Mr Czuba, 71, allegedly targeted the two, who were his tenants, because of their religion and the Israel-Hamas war. He is also facing attempted murder and aggravated battery charges. In a court hearing on Monday, Mr Czuba spoke briefly to acknowledge the court. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 20 years to life in prison. Mr Czuba's court-appointed lawyers argued that he should be released pending trial, saying he has no previous convictions and is not a threat to the community. But Judge David Carlson disagreed and ordered him held in jail until the next hearing in the case in January. According to court documents citing an interview with his wife, Mr Czuba regularly listened to conservative talk radio and was worried about reports of a ""National Day of Jihad"" on 13 October. Mr Czuba's wife said he was also concerned that the country's power grid was going to go down, and had withdrawn $1,000 (£800) from a bank account. According to court documents, on 14 October Mr Czuba confronted Ms Shahin and told her he was angry about events in the Middle East. The court filing says that Ms Shahin responded: ""Let's pray for peace"". It is alleged that Mr Czuba then attacked her and her son with a military-style knife. She and Wadea had lived at the house for two years. Family members said there had been no previous hint of any conflict between Mr Czuba and the victims. An uncle and family spokesman, Yousef Hannon, said that Mr Czuba had bought Wadea a gift for his sixth birthday just a few weeks beforehand. The mother, 32-year-old Hanan Shahin, is still recovering and is expected to survive. Wadea's father attended the hearing on Monday but declined to comment to reporters outside the courtroom. President Joe Biden deplored the alleged hate crime during a speech on the Middle East conflict earlier this month.",2023-10-30T21:39:45.000Z

Andy McDonald: Labour suspends MP after speech at pro-Palestinian rallyPublished30 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Andy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made ""deeply offensive"" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase ""between the river and the sea"" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel. But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as ""a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings"" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation. In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: ""We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty."" The phrase ""from the river to the sea"" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an ""expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world"". Israel and most Jewish groups agree. This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is ""a deeply offensive chant to many."" Mr McDonald said he was ""saddened"" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been ""a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media"", which had ""furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me"". He added that his words ""should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence"". A Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend ""were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety"". ""The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,"" the spokesperson said. Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was ""unjust"" and ""absolutely nonsensical"". ""He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,"" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension ""an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine"". The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as ""obscene and deeply offensive"". ""The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,""the group said in a statement. ""The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle."" Mr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza. In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU. But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire. The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, witha ministerial aide earlier being sackedfrom his government role after calling for a ceasefire. Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country ""will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas"". ""Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,"" Mr Netanyahu said. Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in ""hate marches"". ""We've seen now tens of thousands of people take to the streets following the massacre of Jewish people, the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, chanting for the erasure of Israel from the map,"" Mrs Braverman said. ""To my mind there is only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches."" Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs Braverman of using ""rhetoric carelessly in a way that makes the job of the police much harder"". ""Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime and the glorification of terrorism need to face the full force of the law,"" she said. ""At the same time, work is needed to rebuild community cohesion, to recognise the distress people are feeling about the Hamas attacks and the humanitarian emergency in Gaza, and to pull communities together at this difficult time."" Hamas gunmen killed 1,400 people in an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, after Israel launched a war intended to destroy Hamas. Hamas is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, meaning it is an offence to belong to or support it.",2023-10-30T21:34:01.000Z

Cornell University boosts security after antisemitic threatsPublished30 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"An elite US college has heightened security at its Jewish centre on campus after antisemitic posts appeared online targeting its students. Cornell University in New York state has alerted the FBI to a potential hate crime over the posts. ""We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,"" Martha Pollack, president of the Ivy League college, said. It comes as US President Joe Biden's government unveils measures to combat antisemitism on American campuses. New York Governor Kathy Hochul visited the campus on Monday. She said that ""we will not tolerate threats or hatred, or antisemitism, or any kind of hatred"". The Israel-Gaza conflict has raised tensions at US higher education institutions. The Cornell Daily Sun, the college newspaper,reportedon a series of antisemitic comments left on the website Greekrank. The platform, which is not affiliated with the university, covers fraternity and sorority life on several campuses. The posts have since been deleted, but some are still visible through an archiving website. The Cornell Daily Sun posted screenshots of other messages. The BBC could not immediately independently verify who posted the messages, and whether they came from a member of the student body, a single person or multiple users, or an outside source. One post from a commenter named ""hamas"" was titled ""if i see another jew"". The post used slurs to refer to Jewish people and threatened violence, stalking and rape against Jewish men, women and babies. The user threatened to bring a gun to campus to kill Jewish people. Other posts captured by the Cornell Daily Sun featured similar slurs and threats against Jewish people. The messages came days after anti-Israel graffiti appeared on campus, the paper reported. Several derogatory posts aimed at Muslim students on campus also appeared on the Greekrank website, according to the Cornell Daily Sun. Cornell University Police Department said in a statement that they had ""increased patrols and arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups"". Ms Pollack, the Cornell president, said in a statement on Sunday: ""The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community."" On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was working to combat antisemitism and other hate speech on campuses by increasing communications with local, state and federal authorities.",2023-10-30T20:59:30.000Z

Paul Bristow: Ministerial aide sacked after call for Israel-Gaza ceasefirePublished30 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A ministerial aide has been sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which ""were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility"". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said ""a permanent ceasefire"" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports ""humanitarian pauses"" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week,Rishi Sunak said ""specific pauses"" would allow more aid into Gazabut he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology. After being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: ""I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. ""But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about. ""I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll."" A Downing Street spokesman said: ""Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility."" Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it. A large number of opposition MPs have backed calls for a ceasefire but very few Conservative MPs have. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmeris under increasing pressure to support a full ceasefire, with senior figures including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers supporting one. So far, Sir Keir has only backed humanitarian pauses, aligning him with the position of the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours. They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions. Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country ""will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas"". ""Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,"" Mr Netanyahu said. In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: ""My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. ""Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced. ""It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better."" He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict. Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians ""should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas"". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law. Around 18% of people in Mr Bristow's Peterborough constituency are Muslim, according to the latest census. It is a marginal seat, which he won from Labour with a majority of 2,580 at the last general election. Meanwhile, Andy McDonaldhas been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made ""deeply offensive"" comments  in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,400 people and saw at least 239 people kidnapped as hostages. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.",2023-10-30T20:52:22.000Z

Tank seen on key Gaza road as Israeli forces push deeper into northPublished30 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli forces have pushed deeper into the northern Gaza Strip, with tanks briefly cutting an evacuation route to the south, Palestinian witnesses say. One tank was filmed on Salah al-Din Road, sparking speculation it could be part of an advance on Gaza City. A video showed a car turning around after approaching the tank, which seems to open fire and destroy it. Later, Israel's military said a soldier being held hostage by Hamas was rescued in an overnight ground operation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the freeing of Pte Ori Megidish, who was said to be ""doing well"", as an ""exciting achievement"" that expressed Israel's commitment to release the more than 230 other hostages. He also condemned as ""cruel psychological propaganda"" a video released by Hamas that showed another three Israeli women in captivity in Gaza demanding he agree to a prisoner exchange. The hostages - who include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as soldiers - were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed. Over the weekend, Israel began what Mr Netanyahu called the ""second stage"" of a war intended to destroy Hamas, with ground forces expanding their operations inside Gaza after three weeks of intense bombardment. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,300 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low. Mr Netanyahu has also rejected calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying that to pause military operations would be ""to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism"". ""Today we draw a line between the forces of civilisation and the forces of barbarism,"" he told a news conference on Monday. ""Israel will stand against the forces of barbarism until victory. I hope and pray that civilised nations everywhere will back this fight."" Aid agencies have constantly called for a pause in the fighting in order to send aid to the besieged territory. The video showing the tank on Salah al-Din Road was posted by photojournalist Yousef Basam, who drove northwards in a car on Monday morning. Basam's car is seen coming to a stop just after an intersection known as Netzarim Junction, which is 2.8km (1.75 miles) from the perimeter fence with Israel and about 3km south of Gaza City. He then zooms in on a second vehicle that is slowing down in front of what looks like piles of earth in the middle of the road and a stationary tank. The tank starts to move while the second vehicle carries out a three-point turn. A flash is then seen coming from the direction of the tank just before the car is hit by an explosion. ""He's gone, the whole family is gone,"" shouts one of the men inside Basam's car, as it speeds away and returns southwards. A photographer who was in the area following an air strike told the BBC: ""Suddenly I looked back and I saw Israeli tanks."" He took a couple of pictures and then fled. The Israeli military's chief spokesperson was asked specifically about the tanks at a briefing and declined to give more information. ""We have expanded our operations, involving armour, infantry, and offensive actions within the Gaza Strip. This is done to achieve the two primary objectives of the war, which are countering Hamas and securing the return of the kidnapped individuals,"" Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said. ""While I cannot provide specific details here, I can assure you that the security of our forces remains our top priority."" Earlier, the Israeli military said tanks and troops had continued to expand their ground operations inside Gaza overnight, killing dozens of Hamas fighters barricaded in buildings and tunnels. Air and artillery strikes had hit another 600 ""terror targets"" over the previous 24 hours, including weapons depots, anti-tank missile launching positions and hideouts, it added. The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern city of Khan Younis, said the incident on Salah al-Din Road was significant because Gaza was effectively cut in two for a period. He also said there had been fewer air strikes in the south in the past day, with Israeli forces appearing to be focusing on the advance into northern areas. About 600,000 people are still believed to in the north despite the Israeli military ordering them to evacuate and head south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety. The UN has said 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders despite sheltering thousands of patients and 117,000 displaced people. It has warned that the evacuation of hospitals is impossible without endangering patients' lives. About 400 patients and 14,000 displaced people are believed to be inside Al-Quds Hospital, in Gaza City's southern Tal al-Hawa district, where witnesses say the Israeli bombardment in recent days has been intense. Fresh strikes were reported near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City on Monday, where staff have said it is impossible to carry out an Israeli order to evacuate thousands of displaced civilians sheltering there as well as hundreds of patients, some of them on life support. The Palestinian Red Crescent posteda video that it said showed further air strikes near the hospital on Monday morning. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, which is south of Gaza City, also saidit had been damaged by an Israeli strike in the vicinity on Sunday night. There is similarly concern for patients and staff at Gaza City's biggest hospital - Al Shifa - where the situation has been described as ""catastrophic"" by its chief of surgery. Dr Marwan Abusada said in a voice note to the BBC on Sunday afternoon that 55,000 displaced people were ""occupying each square metre"" of Al-Shifa and that it was ""overwhelmed"" by patients. About 100 patients were moved to other hospitals over the weekend, he said. ""But still we are receiving many, many, many cases. Each half an hour, we receive a huge number of injured people."" The Israeli military has accused Hamas of deliberately basing itself near, or even within, public buildings like hospitals. Hamas has rejected that allegation. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC that civilians sheltering inside hospitals and UN facilities like schools must be protected by all parties under international law. ""The reality is that many people in the north can't move because they physically do not have the transportation, they don't have the means,"" he said. He also warned thatthe looting of flour, hygiene supplies and other items from Unrwa warehousesin central and southern Gaza on Sunday was an indication not only of people's desperation at going without food and safe drinking water, but also of how ""the social fabric of Gaza is starting to break"". Mr White also said the arrival of another 33 aid lorries from Egypt on Sunday, carrying food, water and medical supplies, was ""not going to meet the requirements of Gaza"". ""We need hundreds of trucks moving into Gaza every day,"" he added. ""But what we are very concerned about now is that the public sector and the private sector will collapse.""",2023-10-30T20:22:51.000Z

Two women arrested in London on suspicion of terrorism offencesPublished30 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Two women have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences following a Met Police appeal. The suspects, aged 29 and 44, came forward to a police station in south London on Monday after they recognised themselves in the appeal pictures. They are currently being held in custody at a police station in west London on suspicion of inviting support for a proscribed organisation. The force is continuing to appeal for help identifying a third woman. She was seen on social media at a pro-Palestine protest in Whitehall on 14 October, with an image of a paraglider on her top, the Met said. The force is also asking for help identifying a man seen waving a placard that said: ""I fully support Hamas"" during a protest on Bond Street on 21 October. Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""I am grateful to the public who have reported information to us and I urge anyone who has information about the man and woman we are still seeking to please let us know.

Israel's Netanyahu condemns 'cruel' Hamas video of Israeli hostagesPublished30 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has condemned as ""cruel propaganda"" a video released by Hamas showing Israeli hostages taken during the 7 October attacks. The clip, released on Monday, shows three Israeli women, one of whom berates Mr Netanyahu and calls for the release of the hostages. Hamas seized at least 230 hostages in the attacks and at least 1,400 Israelis were killed. Only four have so far been released. Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, saying the aim is to destroy Hamas and its rule over the territory. The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed. The video of the hostages was released by the armed wing of Hamas, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. We do not know anything about the conditions under which it was filmed. Only one of the hostages addresses the camera throughout the clip. We will not publish the video. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and the BBC does not broadcast material which may have been filmed under duress. In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said: ""This is cruel psychological propaganda by Hamas-Isis [so-called Islamic State]. ""We are hugging the families. We will do everything to return all the kidnapped and missing people home."" He also named the hostages as Elena Trupanov, Danielle Aloni and Rimon Kirsht. ""I hug you,"" Mr Netanyahu said. Ms Aloni's five-year-old daughter, as well as her sister and brother-in-law and their three-year-old twin daughters, was also kidnapped on 7 October. At a news conference on Monday, Ms Aloni's father said his heart had ""nearly stopped beating"" when he saw her picture. He called on the Emir of Qatar, who has served as a key mediator in the hostage talks, to ""make every possible effort to bring them home"". On 21 October, two weeks after the initial attacks, Hamasreleased two hostages, mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan. The group said the pair, who have US-Israeli citizenship, were freed for ""humanitarian reasons"". Two days later,another two women, Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, were also freed. Both are Israeli but were released into Egypt. Hamas said again that it had freed them on humanitarian and health grounds, but claimed Israel had refused to receive them. Both women's husbands are still being held. It is no accident that the only images of the hostages we have seen since their violent abduction have been of women. There is absolutely no doubt that the release of the footage is designed to play on the emotions of all Israelis in ways that are likely to make Mr Netanyahu's situation even harder. He is already under enormous pressure from the families of hostages to do more to release their loved ones. Two days ago, he said this was his second priority, after the need to destroy Hamas. In the video, Ms Aloni delivers a furious attack on Mr Netanyahu's alleged failure to protect civilians on 7 October. Even if it was uttered under conditions of extreme duress, it plays into an anguished debate in Israel about how the government and the military allowed any of this to happen. At a separate news conference on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said he felt the ""anguish"" of the hostages' families, but insisted that ground action represented the best chance of freeing them. ""Hamas will not do it unless they're under pressure. They simply will not do it. This creates pressure,"" he said.",2023-10-30T18:27:16.000Z

Tanzanian students taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza namedPublished30 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Two Tanzanian students taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza have been named by the Israeli government. Joshua Loitu Mollel and Clemence Felix Mtenga were in Israel as part of an agricultural internship programme,Israel's foreign ministry said on X. ""They were kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and are being held hostage in Gaza,"" the statement read. Mr Mollel's father told the BBC he hoped that his eldest son would return safely. Tanzania's ambassador to Israel has assured both families the two governments were working together to secure their release. However, the Tanzanian authorities have not commented publicly on the seizure of their citizens. Before it was confirmed that his son, 21, had been taken hostage, Mr Mollel told the BBC he could not eat or sleepbecause he was desperate to know what had happened to him. ""When I go to the market people ask me why I'm losing so much weight,"" he said last week. The last time Mr Mollel spoke to his son was on Thursday 5 October - two days before the Hamas gunmen attacked Kibbutz Nahal Oz, where he was studying. The last words he said were: ""Be on your best behaviour because you're somewhere new, and make the most of the internship you're there to do."" Mr Mtenga's sister told the BBC they were worried about him but remained hopeful they would be rescued. The family say they have been in contact with Mr Mtenge's roommate who managed to avoid being captured by Hamas, and keeps them informed about the situation in Israel. They had one message for the 22-year-old: ""He should be courageous where he is, know that we love him and we pray for him day and night, hoping that he will be back soon."" The two were among 260 Tanzanian students in Israel. On 7 October 1,400 people were massacred by Hamas - which the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - in Israel. More than 230 hostages were taken over the border to the Gaza Strip which is under Hamas control. Israel says they come from 25 countries, including one South African who is yet to be identified. The South African authorities have not commented. Hamas says it has hidden the hostages in ""safe places and tunnels"" within Gaza. Four of the hostages have since been released, including Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old grandmother who was kidnapped alongside her husband Oded from a different kibbutz. During the handover she shook the hand of her Hamas captor. She said she had been beaten with sticks while being taken to Gaza but had otherwise been well treated. Since the attack, Israel has retaliated with air strikes that have killed more than 8,000 people, according to Gaza's health ministry, which is run by Hamas.",2023-10-30T16:43:10.000Z

Pro-Palestinian protests: Met Commissioner calls for clarityPublished30 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has called for clarity from the government on extremism, as he faces criticism over the handling of pro-Palestinian protests in London. Five people have been charged after being arrested at the demonstrations in central London on Saturday. The home secretary urged a ""zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism"". Sir Mark said about 100 people had been arrested at protests since the Hamas attack on Israel three weeks ago. He added that ""many more"" arrests are expected in the near future. Nine people were arrested in central London during a mainly peaceful pro-Palestinian demonstration on Saturday, which was attended by at least 100,000 people calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. Responding to Sir Mark's comments, Ms Braverman said some people who were protesting were ""chanting for the erasure of Israel"". She said police were concerned about a ""large number of bad actors deliberately operating beneath the criminal threshold"" at the protests. Noting that police and Crown Prosecution Service are operationally independent, Ms Braverman said: ""They need to make those decisions based on the facts and evidence as they see them. But I have made my views clear, these are hate marches and the police must take a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism."" Since Hamas attacked on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 230 back to Gaza as hostages, Israel has responded with a retaliatory bombing campaign and ground operation. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 8,000 people have been killed as a result of Israeli attacks. In an update on Sunday night, the Met said a 33-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman have been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence, a 51-year-old woman and a 16-year-old boy were charged with public order offences while a 41-year-old man was charged with causing actual bodily harm. Sir Mark said his officers are limited by legal definitions of extremism and that he would support a review into the definition and how it should be policed. ""There is scope to be much sharper in how we deal with extremism within this country. The law was never designed to deal with extremism, there's a lot to do with terrorism and hate crime but we don't have a body of law that deals with extremism, and that is creating a gap."" He said lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service are working in the police operations room to help identify offences. ""We've got these big protests and some of what goes on there, people do find it upsetting and distasteful and sometimes people give an instinctive view that must not be legal. ""But there's no point arresting hundreds of people if it's not prosecutable, that's just inflaming things. ""We will robustly enforce up to the line of the law. We're going to be absolutely ruthless, and we have been, and you'll see many more arrests over the next week or so."" Meanwhile, an education minister has said he agreed with the sentiment recently expressed by the deputy mayor of Jerusalem that London has a problem with antisemitism. Speaking on LBC, Robert Halfon, who is Jewish, warned it is a ""fearful time for Jews in the UK"", adding there is also a problem of ""ever-increasing incidents of antisemitism"" in universities. After Mr Sunak chaired an emergency meeting to discuss the ongoing situation and its impact on communities in the UK, a Downing Street spokesman expressed concern at an increase in antisemitic and anti-Muslim incidents. Speaking to reporters, the PM's spokesman described videos and pictures shared on social media over the weekend as ""extremely concerning"" and insisted that the government was working to reassure affected communities. Asked about calls for clarity on the definition of extremism, Downing Street said the government would look at any gaps in the law that might exist. ""It's important that frontline officers feel they have certainty and clarity,"" the spokesman added, but he also insisted that the police did have powers to act.

"Shani Louk: Woman missing after Hamas attack is dead, says motherPublished30 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The mother of Shani Louk, an Israeli-German woman thought to have been kidnapped by Hamas gunmen at a music festival in Israel, says her daughter is dead. Speaking to German media, Ricarda Louk said she had been told by the Israeli military that a DNA sample taken from part of a skull bone proved to be Shani's. Her body has not yet been found. Shani's sister also confirmed the death on social media. Adi Louk wrote on Instagram on Monday that Shani had been killed in the ""massacre at Re'im"" - a reference to the attack staged by Hamas in southern Israel, near the Gaza Strip, on 7 October. But it was not clear from the reports where or when the fragment of her skull had been found. Israel's foreign ministry wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it was ""devastated"" to have to share the news of her death. The 22-year-old had been attending the festival near the Kibbutz Re'im when gunmen opened fire and sent terrified partygoers fleeing through the desert. More than 260 people were killed, the Israeli authorities said, while others were taken hostage. Soon after the attack, a video began circulating widely on social media, showing the body of a young woman being paraded through the streets in the back of a flatbed truck, surrounded by armed fighters and others yelling ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Greatest). The woman was lying face down but Ms Louk's family say they identified her from her dreadlocks and distinctive tattoos. While there was speculation online and in the media that she was dead, Ms Louk's mothersaid at the timeshe believed her daughter was alive. ""We were sent a video in which I could clearly see our daughter unconscious in the car with the Palestinians and them driving around the Gaza Strip,"" Ricarda Louk said in an appeal for information posted online. Speaking to the German TV news channel RTL/ntv on Monday, Ricarda Louk said she now assumed her daughter had been dead since 7 October and may have been shot in the head during the Hamas attack. ""At least she [Shani] didn't suffer,"" she said, adding that it was good to have certainty. More than 1,400 people were killed in the attacks by Hamas, according to the Israeli authorities, but there has been a delay in identifying some people due to the poor condition of some of the bodies. More than 220 are thought to have been taken hostage and four people have been released. Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began.",2023-10-30T13:55:54.000Z

"Bodies of Lianne, Noiya and Yahel Sharabi were found 'cuddled together'Published30 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","The parents of a British-Israeli woman killed in her home by Hamas alongside her two children say they were found ""all cuddled together"". Bristol-born Lianne Sharabi, 48, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas stormed their home in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on 7 October. Gill and Pete Brisley said Lianne was a ""devoted mother"" who ""tried to protect her daughters to the end"". ""Lianne was doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms."" Mr and Mrs Brisley, who now live in Bridgend, spoke to the BBC about their daughter and grandchildren Noiya and Yaheljust days after their funeral. ""Our three beautiful girls are no longer with us,"" Mrs Brisley said. Describing Lianne as a ""wonderful"" person, Mrs Brisley said that Israel was normally a ""very friendly"" and ""a lovely place to bring up a family"". ""Where they were living, under normal circumstances, was the safest place to bring up kids: great nurseries, schools, they knew everybody and they did sport, bike rides, visits to other parts of Israel,"" she said. That was until Hamas moved in on their home on 7 October, a house they had moved to three years before. Mr Brisley said he first saw the news on the TV. ""I switched on the TV, saw there was trouble, sent messages to Lianne to ask her if she was OK, and there was no response,"" he said. ""I think by then she had already gone. ""Their house was one of the nearest to the fence where the Hamas soldiers came in. Everybody on the street was killed or badly injured."" Mrs Brisley said they later found out the bodies of their daughter and grandchildren had been found by a soldier ""all cuddled together with Lianne doing what a mother would do - holding her babies in her arms, trying to protect them at the end"". ""A small comfort but a comfort nevertheless,"" she added. ""I have horrible images in my mind, waking or sleeping. All I can hope was that it was a quick death."" Mrs Brisley said Lianne, who went to Mangotsfield primary school, was a ""happy child"" growing up and had ""always wanted to travel the world"". She said Lianne eventually moved to Israel from Staple Hill in Bristol aged 19 to work on a kibbutz - a community where people voluntarily live and work together. ""She went to Israel on a working holiday there, three months later, she rang to say she met a man,"" Mrs Brisley said. She said Lianne then built her life there, learning and becoming fluent in Hebrew and having two daughters, 13-year-old Yahel and Noiya, 16. ""They were beautiful and lovely grandchildren,"" Mrs Brisley said. ""They ran up to us, put their arms around us every time we got to the gates of the airport."" Mrs Brisley said Yahel had ""so much energy"". She had started scuba diving lessons and ""never sat still"". ""She had a keen interest in the natural world, stars and space, and loved animals,"" she said. ""Noiya was more quiet, but very affectionate, very caring and compassionate, she spent a lot of time looking after disabled children and adults. She wanted to make a career in social work."" Mrs Brisley said while she could not hold a tune, Noiya loved to dance and sing. ""To make us laugh she would sing at the top of her voice, and chase us round the kitchen. What a dreadful voice but a great dancer,"" she added. Mrs Brisley said she last saw her daughter and grandchildren in July, after they attended Yahel's Bat Mitzvah, where they spent their two-week holiday ""playing in the pool"" and ""playing silly games"". ""The whole family was together,"" she said. Unable to travel for the funeral, the family said they said their goodbyes by watching videos of the service on WhatsApp. ""There were hundreds of people there. They were a very popular family, the girls were loved by everyone. ""We feel numb... it is what it is, we can't change it,"" Mrs Brisley said. ""We must get through it.""

UN: Thousands in Gaza break into warehouses in search of aidPublished29 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Thousands of people in Gaza have broken into aid depots to take supplies in what the UN called a ""worrying sign of civil order starting to break down"". The UN relief agency for Palestinians (Unrwa) said warehouses holding basics like flour and soap were ransacked. The news comes as Israel intensifies military action against Hamas in Gaza. More than half of the Strip's 2.4 million inhabitants have been displaced and thousands of buildings have been destroyed, the UN says. Hamas gunmen launched unprecedented attacks on Israel from Gaza on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking 230 hostages. Since then, Israel has been carrying out strikes and now ground operations in Gaza, where the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed. Unwra said its second largest depot - located in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip - was targeted on Saturday as it holds most of the humanitarian aid delivered by the UN. People took flour, wheat and hygiene kits after storming this and several other storage facilities in the centre and south of Gaza, the agency said. A senior spokeswoman for the UN World Food Programme (WFP), Abeer Etefa, told the BBC that the raids on warehouses were ""expected"" because of the ""difficult conditions facing people"". ""The bottom line is that people are desperate, they are hungry,"" she said. Some of the displaced Gazans who took items from the UN warehouses told AFP news agency they had ""no flour, no aid, no water, not even toilets"". Gaza resident Abdulrahman al-Kilani said: ""Our houses were destroyed. No one cares about us. We appeal to the people of the world. All international powers are against us. We needed aid, and we wouldn't have done this if we weren't in need."" Very little aid, and no fuel, has been allowed to enter Gaza since the attack by Hamas. Israel says it is concerned that supplies will be used by Hamas to continue the conflict. But officials on Sunday indicated that Israel would allow more aid into the strip in the coming days. In a video statement posted on social media, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said humanitarian aid from Egypt and the US would be expanded into Gaza on Sunday, without elaborating further on the details. However spokesman for Egypt's foreign ministry, Ahmed Abu Zeid, accused Israel of ""obstructing"" aid deliveries by implementing cumbersome security checks. Meanwhile,  UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the situation in Gaza was growing more desperate by the hour. ""More than two million people, with nowhere safe to go, are being denied the essentials for life - food, water, shelter and medical care - while being subjected to relentless bombardment. I urge all those with responsibility to step back from the brink,"" the UN chief said.",2023-10-29T15:36:30.000Z

Pro-Palestinian protest in London sees thousands call for bombing to stopPublished29 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters have marched in London and across the UK to urge an end to Israel's attacks in Gaza. Police said around 70,000 people gathered on the streets of the capital holding flags and banners on Saturday as they demanded an end to the bombing. There were nine arrests, some of which are being treated as suspected hate crimes. Protests also took place in Manchester, Glasgow, Belfast and other cities. It follows the recent upsurge in conflict between Hamas and Israel. Israel has expanded its strikes, three weeks afterHamas launched a cross-border attackthat killed 1,400 people and saw 229 peoplekidnapped as hostages. Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 7,500 Palestinians have been killed as Israel carried out retaliatory strikes. Over the past three weekends huge protests have taken place in major UK cities. On Saturday afternoon, crowds gathered near the Golden Jubilee Bridge holding signs saying ""Gaza, stop the massacre"" and ""Free Palestine, end Israeli occupation"". A sound system led people to chant ""Stop arming Israel. Stop bombing Gaza"" and ""We are all Palestinian"". Some in the crowd chanted ""from the river to the sea"", referring to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean - a chant UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman had previously urged police chiefs to consider interpreting as an ""expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world"". Israel and most Jewish groups agree. The Palestinian Solidarity Campaign and other activists contest this, saying the slogan refers to ""the right of all Palestinians to freedom, equality and justice"". During the march in London, an emotional Chrif El Amraoui told the BBC: ""Just now marching, I'm crying because children are killed daily. Why? Why do they want more to be killed?"" Abdul Mahfuudi attended the protest with his children and said: ""The most important thing for us is for them to stop killing kids. They need to stop."" More than 1,000 Metropolitan Police officers were deployed across London. Of the nine arrests made, seven were for alleged public order offences, a number of which were being treated as hate crimes, and two were for suspected assaults on officers. Earlier, the Met Police said one person had been arrested in Whitehall for assaulting an officer. The officer remains in hospital with a laceration to the head, but ""is in good spirits & appreciates all your wishes"", the Met added, posting a photo of the officer with his head bandaged and doing a thumbs up. Another man was arrested in Waterloo Road on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence and making threats to kill. Close to Downing Street, officers appeared to be detaining someone before scuffles broke out with demonstrators, with punches thrown and kicks. Officers ordered the demonstrators to move away, and one person was carried away to chants of ""let him go"" from other protesters. Scotland Yard also issued an appeal to identify two women in connection with an alleged hate crime incident in Trafalgar Square. Throughout Saturday, the force used public order powers to prevent protesters from gathering outside the Israeli embassy. It also has put in place extra powers until midnight allowing officers to search a person or vehicle for weapons or dangerous instruments and to require people to remove an item they are wearing ""for the purposes of wholly or mainly concealing their identity"". These powers apply across the City of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea. On Saturday evening the force said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that officers were monitoring a group gathered at Piccadilly Circus and would use separate powers to disperse anyone causing anti-social behaviour. Elsewhere in the UK, thousands attended a pro-Palestinian rally outside Manchester's Central Library at St Peter's Square. On Friday, the region's mayor Andy Burnhamjoined international callsfor ""a ceasefire by all sides and for the hostages to be released unharmed"". About 3,000 protestersgathered in Belfast City Centrefor a rally which walked along Royal Avenue to City Hall. A sea of Palestinian flags could be seen in Glasgow, with thousands gathering in George Square in the heart of the city calling for an immediate ceasefire. Some of the crowd clambered onto statues and monuments. Last weekend, similar numbers of officers were involved in policing demonstrations in London and 10 people were arrested on the day. A video later emerged online of a pro-Palestinian protester chanting ""jihad"" at a smaller protest near the main march last weekend, but the Met said it ""had not identified any offences arising from the specific clip"". It prompted Suella Braverman toquestion Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowleyover why arrests had not been made. Ahead of this weekend's demonstrations, the force said officers would be expected to intervene if protesters use the word ""jihad"" in chants. ""Jihad"" literally means ""effort"" or ""struggle"" in Arabic. In Islam the main meaning is an internal struggle, such as a believer's struggle to live in accordance with their faith. It can also be an outward struggle or war, which in Islamic teaching must be in self defence and within prescribed limits. Demonstrations have been taking place around the world to call for fighting to stop and for aid to be allowed into Gaza. Protesters demanding a truce flooded Grand Central Terminal in New York, forcing the station to close temporarily.",2023-10-29T12:49:04.000Z

Demonstrators gathered at the Aneurin Bevan statue on Queen Street in Cardiff before heading down St Mary Street toward the BBC's office on Saturday. One of the attendees called the protest ""fairly spontaneous"", saying it involved a number of different groups. Cardiff University lecturer Joey Whitfield said the protesters wanted to see an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Deidre Murphy, 69, from Swansea, has been charged with criminal damage and is due to appear at Cardiff Magistrates' Court on 14 November, South Wales Police said on Sunday.

Netanyahu meets Israeli hostages' families anxious over Gaza war plansPublished29 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met families of Israelis held hostage by Hamas, who have expressed concern about the intensifying attacks on Gaza. The Missing Families Forum said the night when troops moved into northern Gaza had been ""the worst"" so far. They complained about the impact of a ground operation on the well-being of the 230 hostages. Mr Netanyahu has promised to do everything possible to bring them home. Ahead of the meeting, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said their relatives ""are anxious about the fate of their loved ones and are waiting for an explanation"" of the Israeli military's actions. In response to the statement, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said he would meet representatives of the group on Sunday. During the meeting, Mr Netanyahu said that recovering the hostages was an ""integral"" part of the military's goals. ""Pressure is key. The greater the pressure the greater the chances,"" he said. The hostages were taken by Hamas gunmen during an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed. After the meeting, Hamas said Israel would have to release all Palestinian prisoners to secure freedom for the hostages. Mr Netanyahu said the idea of a swap deal involving hostages for prisoners had been discussed within the Israeli war cabinet but declined to give details. At a separate news conference, Mr Gallant said Hamas had to be forced to the negotiating table but it was ""very complex"". ""The more military pressure, the more firepower and the more we strike Hamas - the greater our chances are to bring it to a place where it will agree to a solution that will allow the return of your loved ones,"" Mr Gallant told a news conference. Those in captivity in Gaza include dozens of children and elderly people, as well as military personnel. At least 135 are foreign or dual nationals, including 54 Thais, 15 Argentines and two Britons, according to the Israeli government. Hamas - which is designated as a terrorist group by Israel, the UK and other powers - has so far released four hostages following mediation by Qatar and Egypt. Two elderly Israeli women were freed on Monday, while an American-Israeli woman and her daughter were freed on 20 October. There had been speculation before Friday night's ground operation that Qatar-brokered negotiations over another release deal were accelerating. But Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Saturday that there was ""a deliberate desire of parties with interests, led by Hamas, to make cynical exploitation, psychological terrorism, and to influence our population which is in such a sensitive situation"". ""Most importantly, when we have the information, we will provide it,"" he added. ""Returning the hostages home is a supreme national effort. And all our activities, operational, intelligence, are aimed at realizing a goal."" Released hostage Yocheved Lifschitz, an 85-year-old grandmother who was kidnapped alongside her husband Oded from Kibbutz Nir Oz, told reporters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday thatshe ""went through hell"". She described being hit by sticks on the journey to Gaza and being taken into a huge network of underground tunnels that ""looked like a spider's web"". Mrs Lifschitz also said that most of the hostages were being ""treated well"". On Thursday, the spokesman for Hamas's military wing, Abu Ubaida, said around 50 hostages had been killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza. He provided no evidence and it was impossible for the BBC to verify the claim. But the Israeli military has repeatedly said it has bombed Hamas's tunnels.",2023-10-29T11:30:30.000Z

First Minister Humza Yousaf makes contact with family in GazaPublished29 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf says he has finally made contact with his family in Gaza following a communications blackout. Mr Yousaf's in-laws have been trapped in the territory since the deadly attacks by Hamas in Israel. The first minister said he heard from them after two days without contact and they had run out of drinking water. Mr Yousaf reiterated his call for a ceasefire and said humanitarian aid must get through ""without delay"". Phone lines and internet connections are slowly returning to Gaza after more than a day of almost total communications blackout. Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia - had been out of contact since Friday morning and Mr Yousaf said he feared they were dead. They had travelled from their home in Dundee to Gaza to see a sick relative before the conflict broke out. Connectivity to Gaza cut as Israel intensified its bombardment of the territory and began a large ground operation involving tanks and troops. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said is the ""second stage"" of what he says will be a ""long and difficult"" war with Hamas. Writing on X, the website formerly known as Twitter, Mr Yousaf said: ""We heard from my in-laws in Gaza this morning, they are alive, thank God. ""However, they have run out of clean drinking water. ""The UN resolution must be implemented. We need the violence to stop, and for significant amounts of aid to get through without delay."" The first minister has written to all political leaders in the UK, urging them to back a ceasefire in Gaza. He said Israel had a right to defend itself following the attacks on October 7, but he added action must be taken now to stop the ""staggering humanitarian disaster"" unfolding in Gaza.

Belfast rally in support of Palestinians hears calls for Gaza ceasefirePublished28 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"About 3,000 protesters gathered in Belfast city centre for a rally organised by the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign on Saturday. It follows the upsurge in conflict between Hamas and Israel in the Middle East in the past three weeks. A number of pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrations have been held in Belfast since the violence erupted. On Saturday protesters gathered at Writer's Square to show their support for the Palestinian people. They then walked along Royal Avenue to the City Hall. Rallies also took place in other parts of the UK, including London, Manchester and Glasgow. The demonstrations came as Israel expands its strikes on Gaza from land, sea and air, three weeks after Hamas launched an attack on its territory. Hamas launched a surprise assault on Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 220 hostages. Since that attack, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says the Israeli bombardments have killed more than 7,600 people. Speakers at the Belfast rally included Sinn Féin's Declan Kearney, the SDLP's Paul Doherty, the Green Party's Anthony Flynn and Gerry Carroll from People Before Profit. A handful of protesters briefly heckled Mr Kearney, claiming Sinn Féin should be more robustly challenging the US government's policy on the Middle East. One man shouted: ""This a defining moment for Sinn Féin."" Stewards asked for respect for all speakers and the heckling stopped. Mr Kearney, Sinn Féin's national chairperson, later defended his party's policy on the Middle East. He told BBC News NI: ""Sinn Féin's position is consistent on Palestine and has been for decades. We stand with the Palestinian people, we stand in solidarity with them. ""What the Palestinian people need to hear from Belfast today is an unequivocal assertion that there must be an immediate unconditional ceasefire and an urgent resolution of the humanitarian catastrophe which is taking place."" His party colleague, North Belfast MP John Finucane, spoke at Saturday's rally in London. Calling for an immediate ceasefire and the return of hostages, Mr Finucane said the Israeli government ""must grant access and safety to the UN and other humanitarian agencies to fulfil their duties"". ""Our message to the Israeli government is clear and simple - stop. Stop the bombing of Gaza. Stop the blockade of Gaza,"" he added. The first speaker at the Belfast rally was Dr Hani Mahdi, who works in the city and has family in Gaza. Dr Madhi told BBC News NI that 13 members of his extended family had died in Gaza in recent weeks. ""I don't know what's going on with my remaining family members because the communication in Gaza is cut off,"" he said. ""We need there to be a ceasefire, we need there to be peace."" Another speaker was the Rev Bill Shaw, an ordained Presbyterian minister who now leads a community development organisation in north Belfast. In Dublin, several thousand people gathered beside the United States embassy on Saturday in protest at US support for Israel, accusing it of complicity in Israeli attacks on Gaza, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reports. The protests follow similarrallies in Britain and Ireland last weekend.",2023-10-28T21:07:23.000Z

Gaza sees heaviest night of Israeli bombardment since start of warPublished28 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have experienced the heaviest night of Israeli bombardment since the war with Hamas began three weeks ago. Hamas-run authorities said hundreds of buildings were destroyed in air and artillery strikes, and that at least 377 people were killed in the past day. Israel's military said its warplanes hit 150 underground targets, including tunnels and other infrastructure. Tanks and troops also went into the Strip and clashed with Hamas fighters. The military said some soldiers would remain in the field, as Israel's defence minister declared that the war had entered a ""new phase"". Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had entered the second stage of the war with Hamas. He said additional Israeli ground forces have gone into what he called ""that stronghold of evil"" - referring to Gaza - to ""dismantle"" Hamas and bring hostages home. ""This will be a long and difficult war,"" Mr Netanyahu added. Israel began its bombing campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by hundreds of Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 229 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 7,700 people have been killed in the territory since then, and the UN is warning that a ""humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding"". On Friday night, huge explosions lit up the sky as the Israeli military said it was ""operating powerfully on all dimensions in order achieve the goals of the war"", with ""ground forces... expanding their operations"". At the same time, Palestinian mobile phone and internet networks went down, cutting off communications both inside the Strip and making it difficult to get accurate reports out. Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it was fighting Israeli troops in the north-eastern town of Beit Hanoun and the central Bureij area, and that it had also fired barrages of rockets towards Israel. On Saturday morning, the BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, described a scene of total chaos on the ground. He said the bombardment of northern areas was on a scale he had never seen before. There were fewer strikes in southern areas, he added, but there was panic among the hundreds of thousands of people sheltering there after being told by Israel to leave their homes in the north. The Israeli military said warplanes struck 150 underground targets in northern Gaza belonging to Hamas - which Israel, the UK and other powers class as a terrorist group - including ""tunnels, underground combat spaces and additional underground infrastructure"". Later, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant declared: ""Last night, the earth in Gaza shook. We attacked above the ground and under it. We attacked terrorist operatives from all levels everywhere. ""The directives to the forces are clear: the operation will continue until further notice."" Gaza Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassal told AFP news agency that ""hundreds of buildings and houses were completely destroyed and thousands of other homes were damaged"" in the Israeli strikes, adding that they had ""changed the landscape"" of northern Gaza. Photographer Shehab Younis posted a video on Instagram showing a badly wounded man being rushed out of a building and put into the back of a truck because there was no ambulance. He told the BBC in a voice note that the situation was ""catastrophic"", with people unable to contact emergency services because all means of communication were down. William Schomburg, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross sub-delegation in Gaza,told the BBC that hospitals had been operating non-stop to deal with the casualties. ""I've been able to visit different hospitals, including the Al-Quds hospital, and the scenes there are difficult to describe,"" he said. ""Healthcare workers that are operating around the clock while also dealing with a lot of personal tragedy. I spoke to one doctor who had lost his brother and cousin the night before."" Mr Schomburg said healthcare facilities had also been transformed into centres for displaced civilians ""who fear that the only safe place for them is on a hospital floor"". The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - which is hosting more than 600,000 of the 1.4 million people who have fled their homes - said that it lost most contact with its teams during what it described as the ""worst and most intensive night"" of bombings so far. ""The breaks in communications are making our work... extremely challenging,"" spokeswoman Juliette Touma said. ""We have lost so far 53 colleagues and are terrified that the number might have increased given the bombardment overnight."" UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was surprised by the intensity of Israel's strikes. ""I was encouraged in the last days by what seemed to be a growing consensus... for the need of at least a humanitarian pause in the fighting to facilitate the release of hostages in Gaza, the evacuation of third country nationals and the necessary massive scale up of the delivery of humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza,"" he said. ""Regrettably, instead of the pause, I was surprised by an unprecedented escalation of the bombardments and their devastating impacts, undermining the referred humanitarian objectives."" Israel also cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for Hamas's attack. It has allowed 84 lorries carrying aid to cross from Egypt over the past week, but the UN has called that a ""drop in the ocean"". About 500 aid lorries per day were coming into Gaza before the war began. There have been no shipments of fuel, which is needed to generate electricity for hospitals, shelters, bakeries, water treatment and pumping stations. Israel refuses to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas. It also accuses Hamas of hoarding fuel.",2023-10-28T21:06:46.000Z

Israel recalls diplomats from Turkey in Gaza rowPublished28 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel has recalled diplomats from Turkey after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused it of behaving like a ""war criminal"". He made the comments while addressing thousands of demonstrators at a pro-Palestinian rally in Istanbul. The Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen responded by ordering diplomats to return. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has ""the most moral army in the world"". Israel has expanded its strikes on the Gaza Strip, three weeks after Hamas launched its attack on southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking 229 people hostage. Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 7,500 Palestinians have been killed as Israel carries out retaliatory strikes. Addressing a crowd of several hundred thousand Palestinian supporters on Saturday, the Turkish president said ""the main culprit behind the massacre unfolding in Gaza is the West"". ""Israel has been openly committing war crimes for 22 days, but the Western leaders cannot even call on Israel for a ceasefire, let alone react to it,"" he said. He accused Israel of behaving like a ""war criminal"" and accused it of trying to ""eradicate"" Palestinians. He continued: ""Of course, every country has the right to defend itself. But where is the justice in this case? There is no justice - just a vicious massacre happening in Gaza."" It follows posts from the Turkish leader earlier on Saturday on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which he said the latest escalation had targeted ""innocent civilians"" and worsened Gaza's humanitarian crisis, adding: ""Israel must immediately stop this madness and end its attacks"". Moments after President Erdogan finished his remarks at the rally, Israel's Foreign Minister Mr Cohen said on X: ""Given the grave statements coming from Turkey, I have ordered the return of diplomatic representatives there in order to conduct a re-evaluation of the relations between Israel and Turkey."" Israeli Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu later said: ""Don't accuse us of war crimes. If you think that you can accuse our soldiers of war crimes that is hypocrisy. We are the most moral army in the world."" He added the Israel Defense Forces is taking precautions to protect civilians, and accused Hamas of committing crimes against humanity by ""using their people as human shields"". The two countries have a history of tense relations. Once close allies, Turkey broke off diplomatic ties with Israel in 2010 after 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish-owned ship trying to break Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip. Relations were restored in 2016, but they expelled each other's top diplomats in 2018 in a dispute over Israel's killing of Palestinians amid protests on the Gaza-Israel border. Turkey does not consider Hamas a terrorist organisation - unlike countries including the US and UK. It has long hosted its members and supports a two-state solution.",2023-10-28T20:55:50.000Z

The messages of fear that trickled out while Gaza was disconnectedPublished28 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A voice note arrives from a journalist in a city in central Gaza, where lines of communication have been almost completely eliminated. Mid-way through the audio, a loud explosion thuds in the background. ""The situation is very dangerous,"" he says, adding that many people don't know what happened to their relatives overnight. The WhatsApp voice note, sent from the city of Deir al-Balah on Saturday, provided one of few insights available into what was happening in Gaza that day - and how civilians were coping with Israel's intensified air strikes and expanded ground operations. Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said there had been a ""collapse in connectivity"" in the enclave. The blackout meant people couldn't contact their friends or family - or even ambulances to pick up the injured. On Sunday, connectivity was returning to the territory. But on Saturday, most people in Gaza were unreachable: WhatsApp messages remained on one grey tick, showing they had been sent but not received. Calls went straight to answerphone messages. In the last communication we had with a professor in Gaza on Friday, he told us he was too scared to follow Israeli evacuation orders and move south, in case his family were caught in a strike on the journey. We could not contact him on Saturday. But a small number of people in Gaza have foreign SIM cards that can pick up Israeli or Egyptian masts - and the BBC was able to establish limited contact with several of them on Saturday. That included the journalist in Deir al-Balah, who described the atmosphere as both tense and confused. ""Some people believe nothing is happening because they are not receiving news updates through messages. They are feeling some comfort,"" he said. ""Others are so nervous because they lost [contact with] all their loved ones."" Further north, in Gaza City, the BBC was able to speak to a different journalist on a short phone call. The man, who asked not to be named, described the bombing overnight as ""brutal"". ""We didn't expect that we would see morning,"" he said, adding that heavy bombing had hit ""streets, governmental buildings, open fields, the beach"". The exact scale of injuries and deaths since Friday night is not known. Photos and video footage on Saturday showed mass destruction and residents trying to pull people from the debris. In one image that is too graphic to show, a man was seen carrying the body of a toddler. In a separate video posted on Instagram, a badly wounded man was rushed out of a building as crowds shouted desperately for an ambulance. Instead, they put the man into the back of a truck. In a patchy voice note, photographer Shebab Younis - who posted the video - described the situation around him as ""catastrophic"". ""We have lost contact with people who have been targeted or injured,"" he said. ""When there is bombardment of houses, the situation has become really very hard because of the lack of communications and internet services. All this is negatively impacting a large number of medical facilities and public service buildings when there are bombings in their areas."" Challenged on whether Israel had cut communication in Gaza, Mark Regev, a senior Israeli government advisor, told the BBC on Saturday it was ""standard behaviour to disrupt the communications of your enemy"", likening it to what he said the UK and US had done in previous conflicts. The United Nations said the blackout had put the civilian population ""in grave danger"". ""Ambulances and civil defence teams are no longer able to locate the injured, or the thousands of people estimated to be still under the rubble,"" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said. ""Civilians are no longer able to receive updated information on where they can access humanitarian relief and where they may be in less danger. Many journalists can now no longer report on the situation."" On Sunday, some people in Gaza were able to speak to the outside world again. But on Saturday, most people there were, in the words of one of our contacts, ""disconnected from the planet"". Additional reporting by Muath Al Khatib",2023-10-28T18:16:17.000Z

We don't know if our family is dead in Gaza - Humza YousafPublished28 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf says he does not know if his family is alive or dead in Gaza, as it remains under a communications blackout. He reiterated his plea for a ceasefire as thousands in Scotland joined pro-Palestinian rallies in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. Mr Yousaf's parents-in-law have been trapped in the territory since the deadly attacks by Hamas in Israel. It has been hit by intense air strikes after Israeli tanks entered on Friday. Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland they had not heard from them since Friday morning, before the magnitude of the bombing increased. Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged - the parents of Mr Yousaf's wife Nadia - had travelled to Gaza to see a sick relative. He said: ""We are desperately worried, and to be frank, we don't know if they are alive or dead. ""That's the reality facing many people across the world who haven't heard from their loved ones who are trapped in Gaza and have been facing bombardment over the last three weeks."" The first minister said the people of Gaza were being ""collectively punished for a crime they did not commit"". ""We need a cease fire and we need one now,"" he added. ""My wife is numb, I'm trying to do my best to give her some hope and keep ourselves distracted, we are trying to call as many relatives as we can across Gaza with no luck. ""This morning I listened to my four-year-old daughter pretending she was to phone her granny, and asking when she will come back."" Civilians in Gaza are cut off from the outside world with phone lines and the internet down for most people. Israel has said the war with Hamas has entered the next stage with its ""best soldiers"" now on the ground in Gaza. Mr Yousaf's comments came as thousands of protestors took to the streets of Scotland calling for an immediate ceasefire. Similar demonstrations took placein many UK cities including Manchester, Belfast and London- where more than 1,000 Metropolitan Police officers were deployed. Speaking the rally in Glasgow, Dr Ibrahim Khadra, a Palestinian academic who works at Strathclyde University, told how 42 of his family members had been killed. He said many of his cousins and uncles has died, adding that he had lost contact with his brother and mother. Dr Khadra said: ""It has been hard for Palestinians who lives outside Palestine and Gaza. We lost communication with them, we don't know anything - whether they are alive or not. ""On my personal level, in the last 22 days I lost 42 of my family - if I have to count friends the number goes much higher than that."" He added: ""Many like me have a similar story to tell. ""We're trying to do our best even though as Palestinians we feel helpless, there is not much we can offer our people other than demonstrating. ""The people who are suffering is not us, it is the people on the ground."" Over the last three weekends huge protests have taken place in major UK cities.

"Israel has no plan for Gaza after war ends, experts warnPublished28 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to ""change the Middle East."" Joe Biden has said there's ""no going back."" But as Israeli forces escalate their attacks on the Gaza Strip and issue fresh, urgent warnings to Palestinians to get out of the way, where is the war going, and what comes next? After the horrors of 7 October, Israeli officials keep saying that they intend to uproot Hamas from the Gaza Strip, militarily and politically. But beyond the application of relentless, overwhelming military might, it's not clear how this unprecedented ambition will be achieved. ""You cannot promote such a historic move without a plan about the day after,"" says Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University's Moshe Dayan Centre. Dr Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence, fears that planning has barely begun. ""You need to do it right now,"" he says. Western diplomats say they're conducting intense discussions with Israel about the future, but that so far nothing is clear. ""There absolutely isn't a fixed plan,"" one told me.  ""You can sketch out a few ideas on paper, but making them real is going to take weeks, months of diplomacy."" Military plans exist, ranging from degrading Hamas's military capability to taking over large parts of the Gaza Strip. But those with long experience of dealing with previous crises say that's about as far as the planning goes. ""I don't think that there is a viable, workable solution for Gaza the day after we evacuate our forces,"" says Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence service, Mossad. Israelis are all-but unanimous: Hamas must be defeated. The massacres of 7 October were simply too appalling. The organisation cannot ever again be allowed to rule over Gaza. But Hamas, Dr Milshtein says, is an idea, not something Israel can simply erase. ""It's not like Berlin in 1945, when you stuck a flag over the Reichstag and that was that."" A better parallel, he says, is Iraq in 2003, where US-led forces attempted to remove all traces of Saddam Hussein's regime. ""De-Baathification"", as it was called, was a disaster. It left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civil servants and members of the armed forces out of work, sowing the seeds for a devastating insurgency. American veterans of that conflict are in Israel, talking to the Israeli military about their experiences in places like Falluja and Mosul. ""I do hope they explain to the Israelis that they made some huge mistakes in Iraq,"" Dr Milshtein says. ""For example, to not have any illusion about eradicating the ruling party or changing the minds of people. That won't happen."" Palestinians agree. ""Hamas is a popular grassroots organisation,"" says Mustafa Barghouti, president of the Palestinian National Initiative. ""If they want to remove Hamas, they'll need to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza."" That thought - that Israel secretly intends to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and into neighbouring Egypt - is stirring the most deeply-rooted Palestinian fears. For a population already largely made up of refugees - those who fled or were driven from their homes when Israel was founded - the thought of another mass exodus conjures memories of the traumatic events of 1948. ""Fleeing means a one-way ticket,"" says Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organisation. ""It doesn't mean coming back."" Israeli commentators, including former senior officials, have made frequent reference to the need for Palestinians to be housed, temporarily, across the border in Sinai. Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel's National Security Council, says the only way for Israel to achieve its military ambitions in Gaza without killing a lot of innocent Palestinians, is for civilians to evacuate Gaza. ""They should cross the border to Egypt,"" he says, ""temporarily or permanently."" Adding to Palestinian fears is a line in US President Joe Biden's 20 October request to Congress to approve funding to support Israel and Ukraine. It says: ""This crisis could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs."" To date, Israel has not said it wants Palestinians to cross the border. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has repeatedly told civilians only to move to ill-defined ""safe areas"" in the south. But Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has warned that Israel's war in Gaza might be ""an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to… migrate to Egypt."" Assuming there are still Gazans in the Gaza Strip when this is all over, who's going to rule them? ""That's the million dollar question,"" says Dr Milshtein. Israel, he says, should support the creation of a new administration, run by Gazans, with buy-in from local leaders and support from the US, Egypt and perhaps Saudi Arabia. It should also include leaders from Fatah, the rival Palestinian faction that Hamas violently ejected from Gaza a year after winning elections in 2006. Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the city of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank. But the PA and its ageing president Mahmud Abbas are wildly unpopular among Palestinians, both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Diana Buttu says the PA might secretly want to return to Gaza, but not if that means ""riding in on the back of an Israeli tank"". And the veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, who briefly served in the PA in the 1990s, bristles at the thought that outsiders, including Israel, will once again attempt to determine how Palestinians run their lives. ""People who think that this is a chessboard and they can move a few pawns here and there and have a checkmate move at the end. This isn't going to happen,"" she says. ""You might find a few collaborators,"" she says, ""but the Gazans will not take kindly to them."" Among those who have dealt with Gaza wars before, albeit not on this scale, there's deep apprehension and a sense that almost everything has been tried before. The former Mossad officer, Haim Tomer, says he would suspend military operations for a month in an effort to get hostages out first. In 2012, after a previous round of fighting in Gaza, he accompanied the Mossad director to Cairo for secret talks that resulted in a ceasefire. Hamas representatives, he says, were ""on the other side of the street,"" with Egyptian officials shuttling in between. A similar mechanism should be used again, he says, and Israel would almost certainly pay a high price. ""I don't care if we release a couple of thousand Hamas prisoners. I want to see our people coming back home."" Israel, he says, could then decide whether to resume full-scale military operations or opt for a long-term ceasefire. But short of physically separating the territory from Israel and dragging it into the Mediterranean, he says Israel is destined to deal with the Gaza Strip indefinitely. ""It's like a bone in our throat.""",2023-10-28T17:26:49.000Z

"Israeli troops clear Gaza areas 'slice by slice', but is this an invasion?Published28 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war","Israeli forces appear to be concentrating on the northern area of the Gaza Strip, in Beit Hanoun, and pushing down a bit further south from there. I am in Sderot, the Israeli border town overlooking Gaza. Continuous heavy artillery fire into Gaza continues. The Israeli battery near here is firing several times a minute. The town itself is almost deserted. Most civilians have either left or been evacuated. The Israeli army has said it is upping the tempo of operations. We have seen from video that has emerged from Gaza on Saturday morning, and from what could be seen along the border area on Friday night, evidence of a very, very large bombardment. But the communications blackout means it's very hard to find out exactly what's going on. For example, I have spoken to the UN who have been able to communicate with their main office in the south over a satellite phone, but as there is no internal communication, they can't connect with their area offices that look after their aid operations - currently suspended completely - to see how they are doing. While the bombardment is very focused on the north, the Gaza Strip is only about 45km long (28 miles), so you can hear the extent of the explosions for miles around and certainly throughout the area. As I understand it, the Israeli army is most likely attempting to clear out tunnels, probably with special forces spotting targets for those air force attacks. Tanks can be more vulnerable in daylight so they may pull some of those back. But as far we can tell, it is still going on. Is it a ground offensive? I don't think we should get too hung up on the definitions of all of this. When we saw the military build-up, the mobilisation of over 300,000 reservists, we thought we would be seeing an all-fronts invasion of Gaza. I think what they may be doing, though, is clearing areas of Gaza slice by slice. I have felt from the tone of comments from the Israeli army that their emphasis was that they would continue pushing, and that this was about ""payback"". I think you could call this a very extended raid, or a ground offensive. It is certainly a very large military operation. Israel's push on the ground is certain also to be killing Palestinian civilians. The more Palestinians they kill the greater the outrage elsewhere in the Middle East, in countries friendly to Israel as well as its enemies. That doesn't guarantee the war will spread. But it increases volatility and uncertainty in a region that is already fragile.",2023-10-28T12:35:08.000Z

People in Gaza uncontactable and all communication down as Israel intensifies bombingPublished28 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"There's been intense Israeli bombardment of Gaza by air, heavier than in previous evenings, while all internet and phone communications appear to be out in the territory. Israel has confirmed its forces are expanding their ground operations. The internet monitoring service Netblocks posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, to say there had been a ""collapse in connectivity"". The Palestinian Red Crescent says it cannot speak to its teams in Gaza. ""We are deeply concerned about the ability of our teams to continue providing their emergency medical services, especially since this disruption affects the central emergency number '101',"" they wrote in a post on X. Meanwhile sirens alerted people in southern Israel to rocket fire from Gaza. On Friday, the Israeli military again told Gaza City citizens to move south after announcing the expansion of its military operation. In a press conference, spokesman Daniel Hagari said the military had ""increased the attacks in Gaza. The air force widely attacks underground targets and terrorist infrastructure, very significantly"". ""In continuation of the offensive activity we carried out in the last few days, the ground forces are expanding the ground activity this evening."" Currently we can't get hold of people in Gaza with communications still down. For example the BBC tried to send a WhatsApp message at 6.40pm local (nearly three hours ago) - it still just has a single tick meaning it hasn't been received by the person's phone. Mobile phone call attempts just get an unobtainable message. We've had the same for several other call attempts - messages and calls aren't going through. BBC Arabic reporter Mehdi Musawi tried to reach journalists and health officials in Gaza all day and could only get short replies on WhatsApp. Eventually, they got through to Gaza's Al Shifa hospital, but by evening all lines of communication were down. By then, live footage showed complete darkness across the region. The reporter sent messages to everyone he had spoken to earlier in the day - but they did not deliver. The panic and anxiety is spreading within the Palestinian diaspora. For the past 20 days, sporadic, limited exchanges on WhatsApp have brought occasional moments of respite. However, any extended gap in communication has been met with paralysing anxiety - marked by questions like: ""Are they dead, are they alive, was their house bombed too?"" In one WhatsApp group relatives from around the world have been frantically messaging since the blackout. ""Oh my god!!"" one wrote. ""It seems a ground offensive may start,"" wrote another. The near-total telecommunications blackout in Gaza risks providing cover for ""mass atrocities"", Human Rights Watch said. ""This information blackout risks providing cover for mass atrocities and contributing to impunity for human rights violations,"" the group's senior technology and human rights researcher, Deborah Brown, said in a statement. The Palestinian telecoms provider Jawwal says there is a ""complete interruption of all communication and internet services with the Gaza strip in light of the ongoing aggression,"" which it says has cut the ""last of the international routes"" connecting Gaza to the outside world. We've asked the Israeli military to comment on the communications outage but so far they have not responded. Additional reporting by Brandon Drenon.",2023-10-28T00:43:40.000Z

Israel angrily dismisses UN truce resolution on GazaPublished27 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Israel has angrily dismissed a UN resolution urging a ""humanitarian truce"" in Gaza, vowing that it will continue to defend itself. The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly called for an immediate humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas. Israeli UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan said the UN no longer held ""even one ounce of legitimacy or relevance"". The US voted against the resolution but has called for a ""humanitarian pause"" in Israeli military operations in Gaza. Israel's military on Friday said it was expanding its operations, as its strikes intensified across the Gaza region. Spokesman Daniel Hagari said forces had ""increased the attacks in Gaza. The air force widely attacks underground targets and terrorist infrastructure, very significantly"". He again told Gaza residents to move further south. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw 229 people taken hostage by Hamas. The UN General Assembly on Friday voted in favour of an immediate truce in Gaza. There were 120 votes in favour, 14 against and 45 abstentions. The resolution - put forward by Jordan on behalf of the Arab group - also condemns all acts of violence against Palestinian and Israeli civilians, including all ""terror and indiscriminate attacks"". The vote is not legally binding, but carries moral weight due to the universality of the UN's membership. Israel's Ambassador Erdan called it ""a dark day for the UN and for mankind,"" vowing his country would use ""every means"" in fighting Hamas. ""Today is a day that will go down as infamy. We have all witnessed that the UN no longer holds even one ounce of legitimacy or relevance,"" he said. He accused those who voted yes of preferring to support ""the defence of Nazi terrorists"" instead of Israel. US national security spokesperson John Kirby said the US would support breaks in fighting to help hostages get out of Gaza - and to allow more aid in. ""We would support humanitarian pauses for stuff getting in, as well as for people getting out, and that includes pushing for fuel to get in and for the restoration of electrical power,"" he said. The White House has not commented on the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) announcement that Israel is expanding its ground operations into Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 7,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began. There is now a critical shortage of essential services, thousands have fled their homes and the infrastructure has been heavily damaged. Among international leaders calling for a ceasefire was France's President Emmanuel Macron. Speaking before Israel said it was increasing its attacks in Gaza, he said he had told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog that the population of Gaza must be protected. ""A humanitarian truce is useful today to be able to protect those who are on the ground, who have suffered bombings,"" he said at the end of a two-day summit of EU leaders in Brussels. Mr Macron reiterated that Israel had a right to defend itself, but he said ""the complete blockade, the indiscriminate bombardment and even more the prospect of a massive ground operation"" posed significant risks for the civilian population in Gaza. Meanwhile, Jordan warned the outcome of what it called a ""ground war"" would be a humanitarian catastrophe. Israel this week called for the UN's secretary general tostep down over comments he made about the Gaza war. António Guterres said in a speech to the Security Council on Tuesday that he condemned unequivocally Hamas's deadly attacks in Israel two weeks ago but that they ""did not happen in a vacuum"". Israel accused him of ""justifying terrorism"" and called for his immediate resignation.",2023-10-27T22:50:37.000Z

Gaza before and after: Satellite images show destructionPublished27 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"New satellite images of Gaza show the extent of the destruction caused by Israel's intense aerial bombardment of the territory - home to 2.2 million people - over the past three weeks. The pictures, released by Maxar Technologies, compare detailed images captured from space earlier this week with images from before the recent conflict began. They show three areas in the north of Gaza where aerial attacks have left dozens of tower blocks completely destroyed or badly damaged as well as large areas of tightly packed buildings reduced to piles of grey rubble. Beit Hanoun, a settlement in the north-eastern corner of Gaza that is just 2km (1.2 miles) away from the border with Israel, is one area shown to have been badly affected. The Israeli military have said the area is a hub for Hamas and it was one of the first areas where Israel warned residents to leave. The area of Beit Hanoun shown below sits on the main road to the Erez border crossing. Several multi-storey buildings that were visible just over two weeks ago are now barely standing. The Hamas-run housing ministry has estimated that about 45% of all the housing units in the territory have been either completely destroyed, rendered uninhabitable or damaged. An estimated 1.4 million people are internally displaced. Thousands of Palestinians have fled their homes in the north of Gaza after being told by the Israeli military to leave for their own safety - but some have returned to the north because strikes are also being carried out in the south. Al Karama, shown below, sits on Gaza's northern coast on the Mediterranean sea. Areas just behind the main coastal road, where several hotels are located, have been hit by Israeli strikes. InAtatra, which is about 3km (1.8 miles) south of the Israeli border, more than 20 high-rise blocks and several buildings have been badly damaged. A sports facility just south of the tower blocks, seen in the image below, was covered by grey ash from the attacks.",2023-10-27T17:17:15.000Z

Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stancePublished27 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to change his position on the Israel-Gaza war, after a trio of senior Labour figures called for a ceasefire. The move from mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, puts them at odds with their party leader. Sir Keir has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza. Labour frontbencher Steve Reed has defended Sir Keir's position. The shadow minister said humanitarian pauses would allow aid to enter Gaza ""without stopping Israel taking action to disable the terrorists who attacked them in the first place"". In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours. They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions. Israel began its bombing campaign in Gaza, cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for a cross-border attack by Hamas on 7 October, in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 224 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 7,000 people have been killed in the territory since then, and that its health system is facing total collapse. In a statement earlier, Mr Khan said Israel had a ""right to defend itself"" following the ""appalling terror attack"" of 7 October. But he added a ceasefire would ""allow the international community more time to prevent a protracted conflict in the region and further devastating loss of life"". In a statement, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and local council leaders said Israel had the right to take ""targeted action within international law"". They added they had ""profound concerns"" about loss of lives in Gaza, and that it was ""vital that urgent support and humanitarian aid is allowed into the area"". The leaders said there should be a ceasefire ""by all sides"" and that all hostages should ""be released unharmed"". In a video, Scottish Labour leader Mr Sarwar said: ""We need to see the immediate release of hostages, immediate access to humanitarian supplies... and the immediate cessation of violence with an end of rocket fire into and out of Gaza."" ""And let me be clear, that means a ceasefire right now,"" he added. On Wednesday, shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray said Sir Keir was likely to be the next prime minister, and therefore had to be ""very careful"" with what he said. ""It's very easy for us all to sit in a warm bath of throwing around ceasefires, etc but Keir Starmer is in a very sensitive position,"" he added. Asked why the UK was not calling for a cessation of violence, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan told ITV that the government would not ""cross that line of telling Israel it has anything but the right to defend itself"". She said a humanitarian pause would enable British citizens to leave Gaza. The Labour leader's overall stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict has also led to growing discomfort in his party. He triggered anger earlier this month, when in reply to an interview question on whether it was ""appropriate"" for Israel to cut off the supply of power and water to Gaza, he said: ""I think that Israel does have that right."" ""Obviously everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself,"" he added. A spokesman for the Labour leader later said he had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence. Around 20 councillors have since quit Labour in protest. In Oxford, resignations have led to Labour losing its majority on the local council. In Westminster, 39 Labour MPs - including shadow minister Imran Hussain - havesigned a parliamentary petitioncalling for an ""immediate de-escalation and cessation of hostilities"". Senior figures adding their voice to calls for a ceasefire is certainly uncomfortable for the Labour leadership. Especially following a recent conference where their outward message was one of unity - a shift away from past divisions and factions within senior ranks of the party. So far, most of the dissent in the party has been from councillors while dozens of Labour MPs have now said publicly they want a ceasefire. While there's been chatter of frontbenchers considering resignations, that hasn't transpired so far. Certainly, senior figures in the party have told me that engagement with concerned MPs is ongoing and that the party is trying to support those who have received threats or abuse as a result of the party's position. They don't deny that lots of people are very concerned. But they argue that at the same time the last thing many in the party want to see is an internal fight - especially if there is an awareness that resignations may not change the leadership's position. Nor can the Labour leadership's position really change what is going on in Israel and Gaza. But for some it feels more like a matter of principle than actually changing anything. Some may begin to feel the heat more from constituents as MPs begin another recess this week.",2023-10-27T17:00:15.000Z

Hate crime soars in London during Gaza conflictPublished27 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Antisemitic hate crime has continued to soar in London, with 408 offences recorded so far this month compared to 28 in the same period last year. Islamophobic hate crime is also on the rise, up from 65 offences last October to 174 so far this month. The Metropolitan Police says it has made 75 arrests linked to the Israel-Gaza conflict, and is investigating 10 potential breaches of terrorism laws. A large pro-Palestinian protest is expected in London on Saturday. Cdr Kyle Gordon, who will lead the operation around Saturday's march, said it would be policed ""right up to the line of the law"" and include discussions about ""anything we've learnt from previous weeks"". But he refused to give details of what officers will do if people are seen calling for jihad during the protest, following a row between the government and the Met this week. Footage of a man making a speech about jihad at a smaller protest close to the main march on 21 October prompted Home Secretary Suella Braverman to question Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley over why arrests had not been made. ""If somebody is calling for jihad specifically against Israel the officers will intervene, gather the information,"" Cdr Gordon said, adding: ""We'll be working with colleagues [from counter-terrorism] in relation to what the best course of action is."" The new crime stats come amid warnings fromsecurityandcommunityfigures that domestic hate crime and radicalisation could be fuelled by events in the Middle East. Counter-terrorism officers are investigating 10 potential crimes linked to online posts, which the Met says includes ""appalling"" material and videoed speeches. The Met are also appealing for information about three women who took part in a pro-Palestinian protest on 14 October. Investigators say they were seen displaying images of paragliders, an apparent reference to a method used by Hamas to infiltrate Israel during the 7 October attacks. They are also appealing for information about a man who police say was pictured holding a placard stating ""I fully support Hamas"" during the 21 October protest in London. Pictures of four people police want to speak to have been released. Hamas is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK. Supporting a banned group is a criminal offence which can be punished by a prison sentence of up to 14 years. Cdr Gordon was also asked about several videos which have emerged on social media of people tearing down or defacing posters designed to raise awareness about hostages being held by in Gaza. Asked what action police were taking on the issue, he said these were ""highly emotive"" actions for the Jewish community but each case had to be looked at in context. The Met is also supporting a number of families of people killed in Israel and working in the country alongside other British officials ahead of future coroners' inquests into the deaths. Cdr Dominic Murphy, head of counter-terrorism for the Met, said there were no current criminal investigations into the killings, but the force ""reserved the right to declare a UK-based investigation"".",2023-10-27T15:14:19.000Z

Sharone Lifschitz's mother was freed but her father is still held by HamasPublished27 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"For the past week, Sharone Lifschitz has barely left her mother's side. Yocheved, 85, wasone of two women freedfrom Hamas captivity in Gaza on Monday, after being taken from her home in Nir Oz. ""My mum is strong and resilient, but her heart is still with the people still in those cellars,"" says Sharone, referring to the underground tunnels where many hostages from the 7 October Hamas attack are believed to be kept. Sharone, a UK-Israeli citizen, flew to Israel when the news came through that her mother had been released. But it was a bittersweet moment. Her 83-year-old father Oded, Yocheved's husband of 63 years, is still missing, presumed to be held captive in the Gaza Strip. ""My father spent his life in the peace movement and he fought for the possibility of both nations [Israelis and Palestinians] living peacefully side by side,"" Sharone told the BBC after her mother was released. ""He believed that you do peace with your enemies. I hope that he is okay. I hope that he's able use his Arabic and that he is being medically treated."" The Lifschitz family had lived in Nir Oz for decades and knew virtually every one of the other 400 or so residents of the liberally minded, agricultural and industrial community. More than 100 of them are thought to have been killed or captured by Hamas gunmen as they ran rampage through the kibbutz on the morning of 7 October. Sharone is now spending her days helping her mother's slow recovery, but also lobbying the Israeli government and its international allies, to do more to free the 229 Israeli and foreign hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. She believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to invade Gaza with tanks and thousands of troops to ""crush Hamas"" should wait to give more time for negotiations to release the hostages. ""These people [in the kibbutz] were failed. These people had to fend for themselves for nine hours,"" says Sharone, clearly still perplexed and aghast at how long it took the Israeli government and army to respond to the attack. ""We were slaughtered and nobody came for hours. This should be the absolute minimum aim, to bring these people back to their communities and their families."" Sharone says her mother's naturally positive demeanour is one reason she made a gesture of peace towards one of her captors, shaking his hand and expressing ""shalom"", a salutation indicating peace, during the moment she was handed over to staff from the International Committee for the Red Cross. The handshake has been questioned by some in Israel, but her daughter says ""she did what she felt was right at that moment"". Sharone said the man was a paramedic who had tended to Yocheved during her captivity, and engaged with her in discussions of peace for the region. But Sharone was keen to stress the care Yocheved had received after the violent abduction should not detract from the hostages' ordeal. Until Yocheved's release this week, there had been no news of the Nir Oz residents taken on the back of motorbikes and cars into Gaza. Among the kidnapped is eight-year-old Ohad Munder-Zichri, his mother and two grandparents. Ohad's older cousin Osnat, 54, described the boy as ""very, very smart"" and ""a gifted child"". ""He's very good at everything he does, since he was born,"" she says. Osnat and her children left Tel Aviv for Jerusalem, where they are staying with family, to escape the rocket barrages from Gaza. The attack on Nir Oz, founded by her parents in the mid-50s, came as a great shock. ""Imagine yourself, you're sitting in your home,"" Osnat told me. ""You've done nothing to no-one and people, the worse kind of people, break into your house, take you out of your house and kidnap you."" One cousin was killed in the attack, she says. This week was Ohad's ninth birthday, but his family says they can't celebrate until he and the rest of his family are free. In the days after her release,Yocheved was able to describenot only the conditions in which she'd been held captive but also that she'd been with other members of Nir Oz - but neither Ohad nor Sharone's father, Oden, were among them. Despite her mother's release, Sharone says it's too early to look to the future. Her parents' home in Nir Oz has been burned to the ground and everything from her mum's photography career and her dad's days in journalism has been lost. She says she won't return to her own family in the UK, nor will her mother Yocheved rest until Oded and the other members of Kibbutz Nir Oz, including Ohad, are free.",2023-10-27T13:38:34.000Z

Israel-Gaza: Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis speaks of hopes for peacePublished27 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis says he hopes Israel is able to ""guarantee peace, not just now but into the future"". Speaking at an event about hostages in Gaza, he told BBC London that militant organisation Hamas ""cannot be allowed to continue to exist"". It comes as several other Israel-Gaza events took place across the capital, including an interfaith tree planting. Toys were also laid out for Palestinian children killed in the war. Rabbi Ephraim made his comments at the launch event for an installation in Hampstead called The Empty Shabbat Table to raise awareness about hostages in Gaza. Organised by the JW3 Jewish Community Centre London, the installation features a Shabbat table with posters of missing people on chairs at dozens of empty place settings. At the event, Rabbi Ephraim was asked about Mayor of London Sadiq Khan's call for a ceasefire. Mr Khan said in a statementthat a ceasefire would ""allow the international community more time to prevent a protracted conflict in the region and further devastating loss of life"". The rabbi did not say whether he agreed with the call, but responded: ""What is so hugely important is that people appreciate the scale of the crime, the enormity of the barbaric attacks against innocent Israelis. ""It is so important that Israel should succeed in her efforts to guarantee peace, not just now but into the future. ""The suffering of every single innocent person is heart-breaking, the death of any innocent person is a tragedy, and I would urge Israel to do whatever it can to guarantee the survival of the state of Israel and the Jewish people."" Rabbi Ephraim added that Hamas ""cannot be allowed to continue to exist, because as long as it is there it poses an existential threat to the state of Israel and a threat to Jews worldwide"". Charlie Balcombe, co-organiser of the installation, said she hoped it would humanise and visualise the people being held hostage. ""You can't help but be moved and upset and broken-hearted when you see these faces of these people, and they're all smiling and they're with their families."" She added: ""This isn't army to army, this is army against civilians, and that's the hard thing to handle."" Outside the Foreign Office in central London, hundreds of people gathered for a Parents for Palestine protest where stuffed toys representing Palestinian children killed during the conflict were laid out on the ground and attached to gates. Protesters chanted ""let Gaza live"" and ""stop arming Israel"" while placards carried messages written by children. One woman who attended said: ""Watching the news over the last two weeks has been deeply distressing. I can't watch another family hold their three-year-old or four-year-old in a white body bag. ""We have to keep fighting, we have to keep telling them that we need a ceasefire, we need humanitarian aid, and we need to stop arming Israel."" Faika, from Chigwell in Essex, said: ""I couldn't imagine, as a mother myself, hearing bombs go off all the time. I've got a seven-month-old baby. ""I wanted to do something peaceful and come out and show some solidarity."" In Dulwich, south-east London, a group of Muslims and Jews joined together with people of all faiths to plant 15 trees The Strengthening Faith Institutions charity consortium, which organised the planting, said members of the project received personal threats that they should stop working together. The consortium said the act of planting the trees ""creates a common purpose and a shared and growing asset"". Rabbi Natan Levy attended the event alongside Mustafa Field, director of Faiths Forum for London. Mr Field said: ""Especially at this time, we are experiencing a lot of tension and we are seeing on fringes of communities an element of hatred spiking, so we need to find ways of bringing people back together."" Rabbi Levy added: ""People have come out from all over London just to do the right thing as people of faith working together. ""We don't want the hate to win.""

Blackburn councillors quit Labour over Israel-Gaza war:Published27 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"Two more councillors have resigned from Labour in protest over the party's stance on the Israel-Gaza war. Blackburn councillors Saj Ali and Mustafa Desai quit on Thursday and will continue as independents. Mr Desai criticised Labour's leadership as ""unwilling to call out atrocities"" against civilians in Gaza. Along with the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer has called for ""humanitarian pauses"" to transport aid but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire. More than 1,400 people were killed in Israel by the armed group Hamas on 7 October. Since then,about 7,000 people have been killed- 40% of whom are children - in Gaza, according to Palestinian officials. About 20 councillors have since stepped down from Labour in protest overSir Keir's position. In a LBC interview on 11 October - when asked if it was appropriate for Israel to cut off water and power to Gaza - he said: ""I think Israel does have that right."" He has since claimed he meant to say that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Ali and Mr Desai decided to quit Labour after a virtual meeting held by the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner to discuss the war, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. In a letter, Mr Desai wrote that the conflict ""continues to claim many, many innocent civilian lives"". ""Yes I condemn the attack by Hamas. ""However I also condemn the disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks on innocent Palestinian people and civilian infrastructure, the displacement of millions and the many breaches of international law - all lives are valuable."" He said previous letters to Sir Keir Starmer ""seeking appropriate responses"" had led to ""nothing forthcoming"". He described his latest requests as ""straightforward"", adding that he thought Sir Keir should call for an immediate ceasefire and ""condemn the atrocities being committed by Israel"". ""I cannot continue being a member of a party whose leadership [is] unwilling to callout atrocities against a civilian population,"" he said. Mr Ali said: ""I had to follow my conscience. I was not happy with the response from the leadership. ""I cannot stand by and watch innocent lives being massacred."" Blackburn Labour MP Kate Hollern, who recently called on the government to work for a ceasefire, said she was ""very sad"" about the pair's departure from the party, adding ""I fully respect their decisions at this difficult time"". Local councillor Altaf ""Tiger"" Patel also stepped down from the Conservatives recently over the government's stance on the conflict. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,TwitterandInstagram?

Giving birth in Gaza amid shelling and power cutsPublished27 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"One month ago, Gaza resident Jumana Emad was in the final stages of pregnancy. She was happily sharing pictures of her heavily pregnant belly, waiting to put her birthing plan into action. She knew she was going to have a girl, her husband was excited, her hospital bag was packed and her four-year-old daughter Tulin couldn't wait to meet her baby sister. Then everything changed. Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and took more than 200 people hostage in an attack on 7 October. Israel launched retaliatory air strikes on Gaza which - the Hamas-run health ministry says - have killed almost 7,000 people. ""I was scared,"" Jumana told the BBC. ""I was in labour among continuous shelling."" The 25-year-old freelance journalist followed Israeli orders to leave her home in the north. She left Gaza City two days after Israeli strikes began and headed south. Afraid and nine months pregnant, Jumana took her daughter to a relative's house. She took only a single piece of clothing, a box of milk and a small bag for her daughter. ""The situation was tough,"" she explained in a voice message. ""We didn't sleep at night. There was a lot of shelling and we had to go to another place. Pregnant women like me should be going out for walks but because of the war we are not able to go out even to buy food,"" she explained in another message. Jumana repeatedly spoke of power outages, internet interruptions and water shortages, in addition to her fear and anxiety over giving birth in such difficult circumstances. On Friday 13 October, Jumana went into labour. She had originally planned to go to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, which is a big hospital, but she was told it was under immense pressure. Instead, Jumana went to Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat, a smaller hospital in the middle of the Gaza Strip. But even getting there was hard. In pain and in labour Jumana struggled to find someone to take her. ""Taxi drivers are afraid, and ambulances don't have time for a woman about to give birth,"" she explained. She described the hours of labour as hard and terrifying. ""There was intense shelling in a house next to the hospital, the sound was so loud that I thought the shelling had reached the hospital itself. Injured people kept arriving. I could hear screams from every direction. I was also thinking about my first daughter. I was worried about her because she was far away from me. ""All I thought about was I want to deliver my baby no matter what."" Jumana described her feeling of shock when hours later that evening, she gave birth to a baby girl, who she decided to name Talia. ""Her crying meant we were all still alive,"" she recalls. There was no bed available for Jumana immediately after childbirth. In pain and bleeding, she had to wait until a bed was found and squeezed into a small room. ""I was lucky to have one, other women lay on couches and on the floor in the hospital corridor immediately after giving birth,"" she says. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates that there are about 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza with 5,500 of them expected to give birth in the next 30 days. It says hospitals are overwhelmed and are running out of medicine and basic supplies. The day after she gave birth, Jumana sent a video of herself holding her baby daughter in a taxi, wrapped in a white blanket. She had left the hospital to join her family but says even that was an ordeal. ""The lift stopped working due to a power issue,"" she says. So Jumana, on the fourth floor of the hospital, in pain after giving birth and with her newborn in her arms, had to walk down several flights of stairs to get to the exit. Once out of the hospital, she was faced with trying to get transport back to the place where she was staying. ""We spent an hour looking for a taxi, and none of the drivers agreed to take us. They were scared after a nearby shelling in the morning. In the end, we found one, but he asked for a higher fare and didn't drop us off in front of the house."" Jumana says childbirth in such hard circumstances has taken its toll. ""I am worn out mentally. I no longer have the desire to do anything,"" she admits. But she tells me Baby Talia is doing well: ""She is a mix of my features, her sister's and her father's. ""If it wasn't for the war, I would have wanted to celebrate a beautiful event one week after the birth. I would have invited all my family members and held an Aqiqah [a traditional Islamic celebration] for her,"" Jumana trails off. She says she does not know what the future holds for her family but is grateful for their new arrival saying: ""She is my hope in this life of war and death.""",2023-10-26T23:07:09.000Z

Israel Gaza: EU calls for 'corridors and pauses' for humanitarian aidPublished26 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"EU leaders have called for ""corridors and pauses"" as a means to get badly needed humanitarian aid into Gaza. After more than five hours of talks at a summit in Brussels, a joint statement urged safe and unhindered access. It follows days of disagreement, with some member states arguing for a longer, single pause in the fighting. Israel began bombing Gaza and cut off fuel, food and other supplies after Hamas's attack in which 1,400 people were killed and 224 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 7,000 people have been killed in the territory since then and that its health system is facing total collapse, with a third of hospitals not functioning and the rest only treating emergency cases. Only small amounts of aid have started reaching Gaza in recent days. The EU leaders' summit is their first face-to-face meeting since the 7 October attacks. Their statement condemns the Hamas attacks and ""strongly emphasises Israel's right to defend itself in line with international law"". ""The European Council expresses its gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and calls for continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs,"" the statement reads. This may not seem like much, but for an institution that represents 27 countries with some fundamentally opposing views on the Israel-Palestinian conflict - it's a compromise. ""Humanitarian pauses"" are meant as short intervals of just a few hours, so that the EU can ""work closely with partners in the region to protect civilians, provide assistance and facilitate access to food, water, medical care, fuel and shelter, ensuring that such assistance is not abused by terrorist organisations"", the statement reads. This follows days of complex negotiations about whether to call for a ""pause"" (singular) or ""pauses"" (plural). ""A single, humanitarian pause would be too close to the concept of a ceasefire - when Israel has the right to defend itself from attack,"" an EU diplomat told the BBC. ""A pause means both actors stop for good, whereas pauses is temporary."" This position was shared by those European countries that have taken a strong pro-Israel stance - including Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic and most importantly Germany, which undoubtedly had a big say in the wording of the EU statement. Some countries will be disappointed. Both Ireland's and Spain's leaders, speaking to journalists before the start of the negotiations, had called for a ceasefire. But the Spanish caretaker Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will be pleased about a new line added to the EU statement at the last minute: ""The European Union supports the holding of an international peace conference soon."" He had called earlier today for an international peace summit in six months to find a solution to the long-standing conflict in the region. The EU is not a military power - all they can do, really, is exercise diplomatic pressure and grant aid. And ultimately, this statement might not change anything. Earlier today Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said the country would make its own decisions about its war plans in Gaza, based on its own interests.",2023-10-26T21:45:28.000Z

Rochdale family-of-10 trapped at Gaza border crossingPublished26 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"A family of 10 from Greater Manchester who are stuck in Gaza are pleading with the British Government to help them escape. The Al-Attar family from Rochdale arrived two days before Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, prompting a bombardment of Gaza. The family have fled to the border crossing with Egypt and have been posting videos online. The Foreign Office has been contacted for a comment. Zaynab Al-Wandawi, her sister-in-law Ikram, plus her husband, his mother and his seven brothers are at the Rafah crossing near Egypt. ""Every single day we are bombarded with bombs, and each one we hear we think 'who did that kill?',"" said Zaynab. ""We have contacted the British embassy to see if they get their own citizens out but with no success. ""No more bombs please get us home."" The Al-Attar family thought they were safe in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, where the Israelis told people in the north to flee to for safety. But they are now at the Rafah crossing, trying to get into Egypt, with thousands of others. The prime minister and foreign secretary are said to have been pushing for the release and safe passage of British subject trapped or being held hostage in Gaza. The family's MP Tony Lloyd said: ""I would like the Foreign Office to give them every help to get home."" The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has yet to respond to a request for a comment. However, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spelled out the government's position on Wednesday, saying: ""We do want British nationals to leave leave Gaza and we want hostages to be released, but there have to be specific pauses for this to happen."" Ikram Al-Attar, a student at the University of Manchester, pleaded: ""Please help call for a ceasefire - no more bombs, no more children need to die.""

Ex-PM Truss wanted stranded migrants brought to UKPublished26 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharing,"Ex-PM Liz Truss called for asylum seekers stranded on a tiny British territory in the Indian Ocean to be brought to the UK for their own safety. The request was made in an email sent on behalf of Ms Truss to the prime minister's office when she was serving as foreign secretary in March 2022. However, it was seemingly ignored. The redacted email was released to the BBC by the Supreme Court of British Indian Ocean Territory this week after being opposed by the government. Responding to BBC questions over the contents of the email, the Foreign Office said the British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot) ""cannot be a backdoor migration route to the UK"". ""Enabling migrants to come to the UK from Biot would only incentivise further irregular migration, and enable criminal gangs to exploit individuals to make dangerous journeys across the sea."" Dozens of Sri Lankan Tamils have been stranded for more than two years in a makeshift camp on the remote island of Diego Garcia, which hosts a secretive UK-US military base. The first group landed there in October 2021 after their fishing boat ran into trouble while trying to sail to Canada, according to migrants and officials. Their subsequent asylum claims were the first to ever be launched on Biot - an area described as being ""constitutionally distinct and separate from the UK"", and where court papers say the refugee convention does not apply. Asylum seekers have described conditions on the island as hellish, but the territory's unusual legal status has left them in limbo. Many claim to have links with the former Tamil Tiger rebels in Sri Lanka, who were defeated in the civil war that ended in 2009, and say they have faced persecution as a result. Some allege they were victims of torture or sexual assault. Ms Truss' email was set to be included as evidence in a court case last month, but a deal was reached beforehand to withdraw decisions to return migrants whose protection claims had been rejected, to Sri Lanka, and to launch a new process. The email sent to the private secretary of then Prime Minister Boris Johnson five months after the first group's arrival, states that while Ms Truss ""strongly supports the government's overall posture on migration"", she ""feels that the unique circumstances and severity of risks in this situation require us to take extraordinary action and bring the migrants to the UK for processing"". It states that arrangements were being made to determine whether the return of migrants to Sri Lanka ""potentially forcibly"" would ""be in line with public international law"". But it says Ms Truss believed ""a more urgent and direct approach"" was required. The email states that the Biot administration has a ""duty of care to the migrants"", and says ""there are severe limitations to the mitigation measures which can be implemented on Biot given the lack of facilities"". It also states that the group had made a ""credible threat of mass suicide"". The BBC has spoken to multiple migrants who say they have attempted suicide because of poor conditions on the island. There have also been hunger strikes, which lawyers say have involved children. ""I didn't want to live here like a caged animal forever,"" one man said earlier this year of his attempted suicide. Lawyers representing asylum seekers on Diego Garcia say that as of late September, 61 remained on the island. Four were in Rwanda after being relocated there for treatment following suicide attempts. Four people have had their claims to be sent to a ""safe third country"" approved, but the BBC understands that no country has yet been identified to relocate them to. One of the group's lawyers, Tessa Gregory, noted that 18 months after Ms Truss's call for the asylum seekers to be relocated to the UK for processing their asylum claims, ""our clients remain on the island enduring terrible conditions with no freedom of movement"". ""[T]heir asylum claims [were] unresolved because the process they have been subjected to did not withstand legal challenge. It is imperative that this group, which includes children, victims of torture and sexual assault, be urgently relocated to a safe third country, like the UK, to have their claims for international protection lawfully and fairly processed.""

UN agencies reduce Gaza aid operations as fuel runs outPublished26 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"UN aid agencies say they have begun to significantly reduce their operations in the Gaza Strip because they have almost exhausted their fuel reserves. Small quantities of fuel retrieved from existing reserves are being used to maintain the water supply in the south, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering from Israeli strikes. However, they will run out on Thursday. The agencies say they have reduced their support for overwhelmed hospitals and bakeries feeding the displaced. ""What we are seeing in the Gaza Strip is unprecedented,"" Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, told the BBC. ""Two million people are being strangled. Gaza is being choked with very, very little assistance that is coming from outside."" Israel began its bombing campaign in Gaza, cut off electricity and most water, and stopped imports of food, fuel and other goods in retaliation for a cross-border attack by Hamas on 7 October, in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 224 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 7,000 people have been killed in the territory since then and that its health system is facing total collapse, with a third of hospitals not functioning and the rest only treating emergency cases. At least 74 lorries carrying food, water and medical supplies have crossed from Egypt via the Rafah border crossing since Saturday, which Ms Touma called ""a drop in the ocean of overwhelming needs"". About 500 lorries were allowed into Gaza every day before the start of the war. Israel refuses to allow deliveries of fuel because it says it could be used for military purposes by Hamas, which it classes as a terrorist organisation - as do the UK, US and other powers. But Ms Touma said Unrwa urgently needed fuel if it was to continue to serve as a lifeline for the 629,000 displaced people taking refuge inside its facilities. Most fled homes in the north of Gaza after being told by the Israeli military to leave for their own safety. ""We're the largest humanitarian organisation and we are on the verge of stopping operations. We are being banned from undertaking the mandate that was entrusted to us by the UN General Assembly. All we're asking to do is to be able to do our work,"" she added. Dr Abdelkader Hammad, a surgeon at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in the UK who arrived in Gaza to carry out transplants the day before the war began, is sheltering at a UN facility in the southern city of Rafah. ""The situation on the ground is deteriorating day by day,"" he told the BBC. ""People are fighting for the water, for the food, because of the shortages. Whatever they have in the stores is running out now. People are queuing for hours and hours to get some bread from the bakeries which are still working."" He also expressed alarm about the conditions at the hospitals where he usually performs operations, saying that his colleagues working at them were describing a ""medical disaster"". ""Theatres are full of wounded people. They have to make very difficult decisions about who they treat because they cannot cope with the sheer number of [wounded] people coming,"" he said. ""They are running out of medical equipment. The fuel is running out."" Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said ina video briefing on X, formerly known as Twitter, that ""we don't want hospitals, or the whole of Gaza, to run out of fuel"". But he advised Unrwa to ask Hamas to hand over some of the hundreds of thousands of litres of fuel that the military claims is being stored in a dozen tanks near the border with Egypt. ""There is enough for many days for hospitals and water pumps to run,"" he added. ""Only the priorities are different. Hamas prefers to have all of the fuel for its war-fighting capabilities, leaving civilians without it."" Asked to comment on the allegation, the UN's regional humanitarian chief, Lynn Hastings, told the BBC: ""We don't have any information about other fuel being available for Hamas to access."" ""I know that is a concern of the Israelis, and quite rightly. It is something that we are trying to address with the Israelis to be able to bring in enough fuel for the humanitarian operations."" Ms Hastings warned that without fuel for their back-up generators Gaza's hospitals would no longer be able to care for about 1,000 patients receiving kidney dialysis treatment, 130 premature babies in incubators, and intensive care patients on ventilators. Gaza's water desalinisation and pumping stations would also cease to function, she said. ""There is very, very little clean drinking water available now, which means people are resorting to drinking dirty or salinated water, or both."" ""It also means that the sanitation system is blocked up, because there is no electricity to pump sewage into the sea. We are expecting the streets to have sewage overflow onto them imminently."" Ms Hastings also complained in a separate statement that the Israeli military was continuing to warn people in Gaza City to evacuate when they had nowhere to go or were unable to move. ""When the evacuation routes are bombed, when people north as well as south are caught up in hostilities, when the essentials for survival are lacking, and when there are no assurances for return, people are left with nothing but impossible choices,"" she warned. In a statement, the Israeli military accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, and stopping them from evacuating south. ""As we have seen in the past, they use a variety of methods including roadblocks,"" it said.",2023-10-26T17:49:11.000Z

How Qatar is at the centre of Israeli hostage talksPublished26 October 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsIsrael-Gaza war,"The abduction by Hamas of over 200 hostages seized from southern Israel on 7 October has propelled the small, gas-rich Arab Gulf state of Qatar into the diplomatic spotlight. Their fate is, to some degree, in Qatar's hands. Why? For the simple reason that Qatar is fulfilling a unique role as the principal mediator between Israel and its avowed enemy, Hamas. Both President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have so far thanked Qatar and its ruling emir for its role in securing the release of four hostages. On Wednesday, Israel's national security adviseradded his appreciation. Qatar is confident that with time, patience and persuasion it can negotiate the release of dozens more hostages in the coming days, although any Israeli ground incursion into Gaza would make this far harder. These hostages, say Qatari officials, would most likely be dual-nationals and non-Israelis. Hamas is expected to want to hang on to the Israeli servicemen it has kidnapped in the hopes of exchanging them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. But this also comes with serious risk for Qatar. As horrific details of Hamas's attack have emerged, some are questioning why this major western ally, which hosts a US military base, is providing a home for the political wing of an organisation proscribed as terrorist by the UK, US and others. If Qatar's efforts going forward prove largely fruitless then its standing in the West will suffer and pressure on Qatar to close that office may ensue. To say that these negotiations over hostages are delicate would be an understatement. Israel is still reeling from the horrific attacks by Hamas and others on that fateful morning of 7 October when the gunmen burst through the border fence, killing around 1,400 people. Gaza is home to 2.3 million Palestinians and the military wing of Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007. It has been pounded by more than two weeks of near round-the-clock Israeli air strikes, killing over 5,000 people so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The UN is calling for an urgent ceasefire. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other nations. Little wonder then that the two sides need a mediator in the middle. So how do these hostage negotiations work? Qatar is home to the political leadership of Hamas which has had an office in the capital, Doha, since 2012, headed by its leader Ismail Haniyeh. Amid the glittering, plate glass and steel skyscrapers of modern Doha, Hamas officials have been sitting down with Qatari diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work through the complex issue of hostage releases. The Qatari mediators are not new to this, I am told. They are from a special government department that oversees the relationship with Hamas in Gaza that has enabled Qatar to pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually to keep Gaza's infrastructure and civil service functioning. Many of the Qatari officials have been to Gaza and are well known to senior Hamas figures. Unlike its Gulf neighbours Bahrain and the UAE, Qatar has no formal diplomatic relationship with Israel although in the 1990s it did host an Israeli trade office. But there are back-channel communications and at key moments during the hostage discussions Qatari officials have been able to speak to their Israeli interlocutors on the phone. There are a lot of factors at work here. Hamas seems to gain little from the release of its hostages, but the organisation, which is an Arabic acronym for The Islamic Resistance Movement, has already been criticised for kidnapping women and children. This, says a senior Saudi prince, Turki Al-Faisal, is against Islamic injunctions. Some analysts believe Hamas wants those hostages, and possibly all its foreign ones too, off its hands sooner rather than later. ""It's bad optics for them,"" says Justin Crump from the strategic thinktank Sibylline. He points out that keeping the location of so many hostages secret from Israel, as well as feeding and caring for them during a war, must present Hamas with a major logistical challenge. Qatari officials, though, say releasing hostages buys Hamas time. With so many families in Israel and elsewhere desperate to secure the release of their loved ones by peaceful means there is mounting pressure on the Israeli government to delay its much vaunted ground incursion into Gaza. It is widely assumed that if and when that begins then the talking will stop. Then there are the mechanics of the actual releases. As expected, Hamas has kept them hidden in tunnels underground. Those few that have been released have been handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross. But transferring up to 50 individuals or more, as has been talked about, would require a pause in the near-relentless airstrikes. Hamas would like to turn that pause into a ceasefire. But the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to prosecute this war until Hamas is destroyed and is therefore reluctant to grant Hamas any kind of a breathing space. This is not the first time Qatar has emerged as a useful mediator. For years it hosted a de facto embassy for the Taliban when they were out of power in Afghanistan. I remember reporting on it in 2013 when the Taliban infuriated the Afghan government in Kabul by raising their white flag inside their compound in Doha. Although the US and its allies were at war with the Taliban it actually suited Washington to have an address where they could talk to them, resulting in the controversial 2020 peace deal that led to the chaotic western pull-out from Kabul the following year. Residents of Doha used to remark on the extraordinary sight of burly, heavily bearded Taliban commanders, dressed in their shalwar kameez, taking their wives shopping for the latest western boutique fashions in the air-conditioned malls of Doha. In Iraq and Syria, the Qataris have used their well-connected intelligence contacts to secure the release of certain hostages held by Islamic State (ISIS). More recently, this year Qatar negotiated the return to their families of four Ukrainian children who had allegedly been abducted by Russia, following a request by Ukraine for Qatar to mediate with Moscow on its behalf. All of this makes Qatar a valuable partner for a lot of countries, some of whom have been beating a metaphorical path to its door as they seek its help in getting their people out of Gaza. But Qatar was already walking a curious diplomatic tightrope even before this crisis. Whether it comes out well from this conflict will depend in large part on whether it can succeed in de-escalating the dire situation in Gaza and deliver on its efforts to secure the release of as many hostages as possible.",2023-10-26T16:56:54.000Z
