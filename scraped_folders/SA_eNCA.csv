Biden announces emergency port for Gaza aid,"WASHINGTON - The US military will establish a temporary port off Gaza's coast to bring in desperately needed aid, President Joe Biden announced Thursday, in a major operation as Israel holds up deliveries on the ground.
Announcing the initiative in his annual State of the Union address, Biden pleaded with Israel to let more assistance into the blockaded territory even as he defended its military operation against Hamas.
""Tonight, I'm directing the US military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments carrying food, water medicine and temporary shelters,"" Biden told the joint session of Congress.
""A temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting in Gaza,"" Biden said.
While led by the US military, the operation will not put US troops on the ground in Gaza, he said.
The aid operation comes after the United States carried out several days of airdrops of aid into Gaza, coordinated with Israel. Such massive operations generally take place in hostile or cut-off regions and have little precedent in territories controlled by a close partner and top recipient of US military aid.
Biden, whose motorcade left the White House for the Capitol after protesters demanding an end to the war gathered in nearby streets, pleaded with Israel to do more.
""To the leadership of Israel I say this: Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority,"" Biden said.
Biden also defended his record as a supporter of Israel, telling lawmakers that ""no one has a stronger record"" -- and again defended Israel's right to respond to the October 7 attack by Hamas.
The war was triggered by an unprecedented Hamas attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of around 1,160 people, mostly civilians, Israeli figures show.
After the attack, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas which has ruled Gaza since 2007. More than 30,000 people have died, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.
 
- Screening through Cyprus -
 The temporary port will feature a pier that will ""provide the capacity for hundreds of additional truckloads of assistance each day,"" a senior Biden administration official said.
In a key factor for Israel, the shipments will be screened by the United States and partners in European Union member Cyprus, not an Arab country. Egypt and Israel share the only land borders with Gaza.
Gazans are facing dire shortages of food, water and medicine, with the United Nations warning of the risk of famine. The entire population of 2.2 million is in ""crisis"" or worse levels of food insecurity, according to the World Food Program.
The UN aid coordinator for the Palestinian territory, Sigrid Kaag, told a Security Council meeting on Thursday that air and sea deliveries cannot be a ""substitute"" for land deliveries, which were halted after October 7 and have only gradually resumed.
In the third airdrop into Gaza in less than a week, American and Jordanian C-130 cargo planes dropped more than 38,000 meals, US Central Command said.
A statement from Jordan's military said Belgian, Dutch, Egyptian and French planes also took part in the airdrop.
The United States launched its first airdrop of food into Gaza on Saturday, providing more than 38,000 meals then also, and dropped more than 36,000 on Tuesday.
But the number of people in need of aid in Gaza is much greater than could be fed by airdrops alone.

Israel strikes Gaza's Rafah as truce talks under way,"Israel launched air strikes Thursday on southern Gaza's Rafah after threatening to send troops against Hamas militants in the city where around 1.4 million Palestinians have sought refuge.
Global powers trying to find a way to end the Israel-Hamas war have so far failed, but a US envoy was expected in Israel on Thursday in the latest attempt to secure a truce deal.
The war has also triggered mounting violence in the occupied West Bank, where three Palestinian gunmen opened fire Thursday on cars in a highway traffic jam, killing one and wounding eight including a young pregnant woman.The attackers were shot dead at the scene, near a Jewish settlement east of Jerusalem. Israeli far-right politicians quickly called for more citizens to carry weapons and for even greater restrictions on Palestinian West Bank residents.
International concern has spiralled over Gaza's high civilian death toll and the dire humanitarian crisis sparked by the war that followed Hamas's October 7 attack against Israel.
More than four months of relentless fighting and bombardment have flattened much of the Hamas-run coastal territory and pushed its population of around 2.4 million to the brink of famine, according to the UN.  
Alarm has centred on Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, where more than 1.4 million people are now living in crowded shelters and makeshift tents where disease threatens. 
Israel has warned that, if Hamas does not free the remaining hostages held in Gaza by the start of Ramadan, it will keep fighting during the Muslim holy month, including in Rafah.Israel has already been bombing targets in Rafah, which was again hit overnight and where early Thursday AFP reporters heard multiple air strikes.
""I woke up to the sound of a huge explosion like an earthquake -- fire, smoke, blasts and dust everywhere,"" said Rami al-Shaer, 21, who said he and others pulled wounded family members from the rubble.
He charged that Israel ""doesn't care"" about the ongoing ceasefire talks and rather ""wants to displace the people from Rafah and are preparing for a ground attack"".
Gaza's Civil Defence agency reported ""a number of martyrs"" there, while elsewhere in Rafah residents walked among the rubble of the city's al-Faruq mosque, after strikes.
 
- Mosque hit -
 The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
Hamas militants also took about 250 Israeli and foreign hostages -- 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 30 presumed dead, according to Israel.
Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 29,410 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest count by Gaza's health ministry.
War cabinet member Benny Gantz said Israel's operation in Rafah would begin ""after the evacuation of the population"", although his government has not specified where civilians could go in devastated Gaza.
Gazans have repeatedly said nowhere is safe, and the health ministry said Thursday that 97 people had been killed across the Palestinian territory over the previous day.
Mediators including the United States, Qatar and Egypt have tried to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage release deal.Brett McGurk, White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, was expected in Israel for his second regional stop after Egypt. 
Hamas's chief Ismail Haniyeh was in Cairo for talks as well, according to the group.
Israel's Gantz said there were efforts to ""promote a new plan for the return of the hostages"", adding that ""we are seeing the first signs that indicate the possibility of progress in this direction"".
US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington hopes for an ""agreement that secures a temporary ceasefire where we can get the hostages out and get humanitarian assistance"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted the army will keep fighting until it has destroyed Hamas and freed the remaining hostages.Netanyahu's failure to bring home all the captives has led to mounting protests and calls for early elections. 
A poll of hundreds of Israelis, published Wednesday, showed a majority do not think ""absolute victory"" is a likely outcome.
The United States, Arab states and others have also called for a pathway to a Palestinian state.
Israel's parliament overwhelmingly backed a proposal by Netanyahu to oppose any unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state.
 
- Vessel on fire -
 The UN humanitarian agency OCHA said humanitarian assistance to Gaza is being gravely hampered by the ""intense hostilities, limitations on the entry and delivery of aid, and growing insecurity"".
In the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said an Israeli tank had fired on a house sheltering their employees and families.
Two relatives of MSF staff were killed and six others injured, it said, condemning the strike in the ""strongest possible terms"". 
When contacted by AFP, the Israeli army said its forces had ""fired at a building"" where ""terror activity is occurring"", adding that it ""regrets"" harm to civilians. 
Troops killed more than 15 militants in western Khan Yunis over the previous day, the military said on Thursday.Elsewhere in the region, the war has led to attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels in the Red Sea shipping area vital for global trade. 
The Huthis say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians.
A missile attack Thursday targeted a vessel transiting the Gulf of Aden, causing a fire on board, two maritime agencies said.
Israel's military also said air defences successfully intercepted an airborne threat identified ""in the area of the Red Sea"".",Thursday 22 February 2024 - 13:00pm
"Gaza hospitals out of fuel, caught in Israel-Hamas fighting","GAZA - Israeli troops waged fierce battles against Hamas on Sunday near Gaza's biggest hospital, where thousands were trapped and officials said a lack of fuel caused deaths of premature babies and critical patients.
More than five weeks into the war sparked by bloody attacks on Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told US media ""there could be"" a deal to free some of the roughly 240 hostages seized by Palestinian militants on October 7 and believed held in Gaza.
But the Israeli premier, facing increasing pressure at home over the captives, stopped short of providing any details.
""The less I say about it, the more I'll increase the chances that it materialises,"" he told NBC.
In Gaza City, Al-Shifa hospital is caught in Israel's ground offensive aimed at destroying Hamas, and the compound has been repeatedly hit by strikes, one of which Hamas health officials said destroyed the cardiac ward on Sunday.The Israeli military has denied deliberately targeting hospitals and has accused the Islamist militant group of using medical facilities or tunnels underneath them as hideouts -- a charge Hamas denies.
Fears intensified for Palestinians seeking shelter and patients needing treatment after Gaza City's Al-Quds hospital went out of service due to lack of generator fuel, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.
The bloodiest ever Gaza war broke out after Hamas fighters poured through the militarised border with Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 240 people hostage, according to Israeli figures.
Israel's relentless campaign in response has killed at least 11,180 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians and including 4,609 children, according to the Hamas government's media office.Despite growing calls for a ceasefire, Netanyahu has flatly rejected halting the fighting without release of the hostages.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told MSNBC there has been ""active negotiation"" on a potential deal but kept mum on any details, while a Palestinian official in Gaza accused Israel of dragging its feet.
""Netanyahu is responsible for the delay and obstacles in reaching a preliminary agreement on the release of several prisoners,"" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity.
 
- Hospital in 'dire' state -
 
Witnesses at Al-Shifa hospital told AFP by phone on Sunday that ""violent fighting"" had raged around the hospital the whole night.
Inside, doctors said Saturday that two babies had died in the neonatal unit after power to their incubators was cut off, and a man had also died when his ventilator shut down.Youssef Abu Rish, deputy health minister in the Hamas government, reported on Sunday the deaths of three more premature babies and six other patients in critical condition.
""We fear the toll will rise further by morning,"" he said.
A ""safe passage"" was to be opened from Al-Shifa to allow people to flee toward the south, the Israeli military said Sunday.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the situation inside Al-Shifa was ""dire and perilous"" and it was ""not functioning as a hospital anymore"".
""It's been three days without electricity, without water and with very poor internet which has severely impacted our ability to provide essential care,"" said WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on X, formerly Twitter, after the agency was able to get in touch with Al-Shifa medical staff.
""Tragically, the number of patient fatalities has increased significantly,"" he said, urging a ceasefire ""now"".
Twenty of Gaza's 36 hospitals are ""no longer functioning"", according to the UN's humanitarian agency.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned Hamas for using ""hospitals and civilians as human shields"" in Gaza, while also urging Israel to show ""maximum restraint"".Very little aid has made it into Gaza during the war, with the densely populated coastal territory effectively sealed off by a total blockade that Israel has vowed to maintain until the hostages are freed.
Only a handful of trucks carrying fuel had been let into Gaza since October 7, with Israel concerned fuel deliveries would be used by Hamas militants.
The Israeli army shared footage of troops leaving jerry cans of fuel outside Al-Shifa, in a video AFP was unable to independently verify.
Military spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Sunday Hamas authorities were preventing hospital staff from collecting the badly needed supply, while Al-Shifa director Mohammad Abu Salmiya told journalists the Israeli claims were ""lies"".
The 300 litres the army said had been delivered would power generators for ""no more than quarter of an hour"" anyway, Abu Salmiya said.
 
- Fleeing south -
 
As fighting raged, around 800 foreigners and dual nationals, as well as several wounded Palestinians, were evacuated from the besieged Gaza Strip to Egypt on Sunday, a Gaza border official said.
Rafah is the only crossing out of Gaza not controlled by Israel, and had been closed on Friday and Saturday.Since November 1, dozens of wounded Palestinians have been evacuated to Egyptian hospitals, with hundreds of dual nationals and foreigners also leaving through Rafah.
Perched on trucks, crammed in cars, pulled by donkeys on carts and on foot, many thousands of Palestinians have fled Israeli army strikes on the territory squeezed between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean.
Almost 1.6 million people -- about two-thirds of Gaza's population -- have been internally displaced since October 7, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA.
Strikes were also hitting buildings at the southern end of Gaza in Rafah, the area to which civilians have been urged to evacuate.
A strike in southern Bani Suheila destroyed a dozen houses on Sunday, killing at least four people and wounding at least 30, said an AFP reporter at the scene.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) urged in a statement ""the protection of civilians in Gaza trapped in fighting"".
""People call us day and night, saying they are afraid to open their door for fear of getting killed,"" said William Schomburg, head of the ICRC mission in the territory.Returning from a summit in the Saudi capital Riyadh, which condemned Israeli forces' offensive in Gaza, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for pressure on the United States to stop the war.
""The West should increase pressure on Israel... It's vital for us to secure a ceasefire,"" he told reporters.
Israel's top ally Washington has offered some criticism of the civilian toll but has voiced support for the offensive and opposed a ceasefire.

Gazans bury their dead in orchards and football fields,"Before he fled his home in northern Gaza, where intense fighting now rages between Israel and Hamas, Mahmud al-Masri had a grim job to do: bury his three brothers and their five children in a nearby citrus orchard.
With his home area turned into a war zone, the bereaved 60-year-old farmer had no choice but to dig makeshift graves and hastily bid farewell to his relatives killed in an Israeli strike.
""We had to bury them there in the orchard because the cemetery is in the border zone where tanks are coming in, and it's very dangerous,"" Masri said. 
""I will transfer the bodies when the war is over.""Masri, who is now holed up with his family in a hospital in southern Gaza, lived in a two-storey house in Beit Hanoun in the semi-rural northeast of the Gaza Strip, not far from the border fence with Israel.
Masri decided initially to ignore Israeli warnings to flee south when war broke out after the October 7 Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people inside Israel, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 hostages taken, according to Israeli officials.
Two weeks of heavy bombardment changed his mind and he resolved to get his wife and children out when the fighting intensified and fears of a massive ground invasion grew day by day.Now -- more than four weeks into the brutal war -- upwards of 10,500 people, again mainly civilians, have been killed in Israeli bombardments of Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Masri told his story to AFP as he and his immediate family sheltered in an overcrowded hospital in the south.
He recalled that he was forced to bury his brothers and nephews in the orchard because the incessant bombing and incursions by Israeli soldiers meant his family could not reach Beit Hanoun's cemetery.He put bricks on the ground to mark where his relatives lay.
But he added that he had since learned that Israeli military bulldozers had destroyed his house and said: ""I don't know if the graves are still there as nothing is being spared.""
- Mass graves -The October 7 attack was the worst in Israeli history, and the Gaza war it unleashed has been the bloodiest yet in the long-blockaded Palestinian territory of 2.4 million.
Bodies have piled up outside hospitals, on roads and in parks, in refrigerated trucks and even in a repurposed ice cream van.
Most cemeteries are either full or inaccessible because of Israeli strikes, and so families of the dead have to improvise when burying their loved ones.
When dozens of people were killed in a bombardment at the Jabalia refugee camp in early November, around 50 bodies were stacked up in the rear of a pick-up truck and taken to a local hospital.From there they were transported, some in donkey-drawn carts, towards a cemetery for burial.
But because of a lack of space there, relatives had to dig a communal mass grave at a dirt football field where local teams used to play, an AFP photographer said.
The sports ground is bordered on three sides by schools run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, which are now shelters for internally displaced Gazans. 
Men using picks and shovels dug a rectangular pit in the football field before burying the bodies, AFPTV footage showed.In the hole, men were laid on one side and women on the other. Corrugated iron sheeting was placed on top and then covered with a layer of earth.
Shihteh Nasser, 48, helped in the burial.
""We bury the dead in football fields and other vacant lots because the proper burial grounds are full,"" he said.
""Sometimes the bodies are taken there in carts because there's no fuel anymore for cars.""

'Exhausted' Gazans desperate for war to end as Israel presses offensive,"JERUSALEM - After nearly three months of deadly strikes, incessant displacements and sputtering humanitarian aid, ""exhausted"" Gazans say they are desperate for an end to the fighting as Israel's war against Hamas looks set to grind on into the new year.
The Israeli army kept up its campaign across the length of the Gaza Strip on Friday in the face of mounting international pushback, with UN chief Antonio Guterres reiterating his call for ""an immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", and South Africa initiating a case against Israel in international court.
The World Health Organization, meanwhile, warned of the growing threat of infectious diseases as fighting displaces more and more Gazans, forcing them ever further south towards the already-overcrowded city of Rafah.
""Enough with this war! We are totally exhausted. We are constantly displaced from one place to another in cold weather,"" said 49-year-old Um Louay Abu Khater from a camp in the southern border city.
""The bombs keep falling on us every day and night. We expect missiles (at any moment), while others are preparing for New Year's Eve celebrations.""
The UN says more than 85 percent of Gaza's 2.4 million people have fled their homes, with many now going hungry and braving the winter rains in makeshift tents.An Israeli siege imposed after October 7, following years of crippling blockade, has led to dire shortages of food, safe water, fuel and medicine, with aid convoys offering only sporadic relief.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said Friday that one such convoy had come under fire from Israeli forces the day before, without causing any casualties.
Ahmed al-Baz, 33, said the year drawing to a close had been ""the worst in my life"".
""It was a year of destruction and devastation,"" he said. ""We went through hell and encountered death itself.""
""We just want the war to end and start the new year at our homes, with a ceasefire declared,"" he added.
 
- Negotiations -
 
The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's bloody October 7 attacks on Israel, which left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
The Palestinian Islamist militants also took about 250 people hostage, more than half of whom remain inside the war zone, some of them believed dead.Israel's relentless military campaign since then has killed at least 21,507 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza.
Israel's army says 168 soldiers have been killed inside the territory.
A Hamas delegation was in Cairo on Friday to discuss an Egyptian plan proposing renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately an end to the war, sources close to Hamas say.
Speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, a Hamas official said the delegation would give ""observations"" on the proposal and seek ""guarantees for a complete Israeli military withdrawal"" from Gaza.Israel has yet to formally comment on the Cairo plan, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told families of hostages on Thursday that ""we are in contact"" with the Egyptian mediators and promised the captives that ""we are working to bring them all back"".
The US news outlet Axios and the Israeli outlet Ynet, both citing unnamed Israeli officials, reported that Qatari mediators had told Israel that Hamas was prepared to resume talks on new hostage releases in exchange for a ceasefire.
In Rafah, 27-year-old Youssef Ahras told AFP he hoped the negotiations could ""stop the bloodshed... because the price of war is so high"".
""I don't know a lot about the political aspects because as locals, we are busy with our essential needs,"" he said.
 
- 'Genocide' claim  -
 
South Africa, meanwhile, filed an application on Friday at the International Court of Justice to start proceedings against Israel for what it said were ""genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza"".
In its filing, it asked the court to ""protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people"".
Responding on the social media platform X, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat wrote that ""Israel rejects with disgust the blood libel spread by South Africa and its application"".Pretoria has strongly condemned Israel's response to the Hamas attacks and has recalled all its diplomats from the country, with Israel in turn recalling its ambassador in South Africa.

North Gaza hospitals 'out of service' as fighting rages,"The hospitals in northern Gaza have been forced out of service amid fuel shortages and intense combat, with the death toll inside the territory's largest facility rising, the Hamas-run health ministry said Monday.
Israel argues its Hamas enemies built their military headquarters under the Al-Shifa hospital complex, while UN agencies and doctors in the facility warned a lack of generator fuel was claiming lives, including infants.
Witnesses reported intense overnight air strikes, with tanks and armoured vehicles just meters from the gate of the sprawling Al-Shifa compound at the heart of the Gaza City, now an urban war zone.
The Hamas government's deputy health minister Youssef Abu Rish said the death toll inside Al-Shifa rose to 27 adult intensive care patients and seven babies since the weekend as the facility suffered fuel shortages.
Gaza has been reliant on generators for over a month after Israel cut off power supplies following the October 7 attack and the besieged territory's only power plant ran out of fuel.
Abu Rish told AFP all hospitals in the north of the embattled territory were ""out of service"".
The World Health Organization in the Palestinian Territories said early Monday that at least 2,300 people -- patients, health workers and people fleeing fighting -- were inside the crippled Al-Shifa.""There are dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded that no one can get to. Ambulances are at a standstill because they get shot at when they go out,"" hospital director Muhammad Abu Selmiya told AFP.
The Israeli army pushed on with their campaign, determined to destroy the Islamist movement whose gunmen it says killed at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 hostages in the country's worst ever attack. 
But Israel is facing intense international pressure to minimise civilian suffering amid its massive air and ground operation, which that Hamas authorities say have killed 11,180 people, including 4,609 children.
Israel said 44 of its troops have been killed in the Gaza offensive.
Flags flew at half-mast at United Nations compounds across the globe on Monday, as staff observed a minute's silence in memory of colleagues killed in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas conflict.
- 'Maximum restraint' -
The EU's humanitarian aid chief Janez Lenarcic called Monday for ""meaningful"" pauses in the fighting and urgent deliveries of fuel to keep hospitals working in the territory.
""More than half of the hospitals in the Gaza Strip stopped working, primarily because of lack of fuel, and fuel is desperately needed,"" Lenarcic said.
The Israel Defense Forces on Monday reported more heavy fighting and again stressed its claim that Hamas was hiding in civilian infrastructure.""IDF troops are continuing to conduct raids... targeting terrorist infrastructure located in central governmental institutions in the heart of the civilian population, including schools, universities, mosques and residences of terrorists,"" it said.
Israeli forces had entered Gaza's Abu Bakr mosque and found ""a large number of explosive devices and flammable materials"" as well as weapons, military equipment and Hamas operational plans, it said.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out calls for a ceasefire, saying Hamas must first release the hostages.
Israelis are still stunned by the October 7 attack and preoccupied with the fate of those missing.Netanyahu told US media that ""there could be"" a deal to free the hostages, but stopped short of providing any details, adding that ""the less I say about it, the more I'll increase the chances that it materialises"".
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told MSNBC there has been ""active negotiation"" on a potential deal but kept mum on any details.
A Palestinian official in Gaza speaking on condition of anonymity accused Israel of dragging its feet.
""Netanyahu is responsible for the delay and obstacles in reaching a preliminary agreement on the release of several prisoners,"" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity.
- International concern -
International attention has focused on the plight of Palestinians, and protests have been held worldwide in solidarity with the 2.4 million under bombardment and siege for more than five weeks.About 980 trucks carrying humanitarian aid have been let into Gaza since October 21, according to the UN humanitarian agency.
Fuel has been a key need, especially for hospital generators, but Israel has been concerned that any fuel deliveries could be diverted to Hamas militants.
A Turkish vessel carrying materials for field hospitals arrived Monday in Egypt's port of El Arish near the Rafah border crossing with Gaza.
Almost 1.6 million people -- about two-thirds of Gaza's population -- have been internally displaced since October 7, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA.
Tens of thousands of Gazans have already fled from the north of the territory under Israeli orders.
But it is unclear what, if any, provisions there would be for the sick and injured to be transported from Al-Shifa.The area of fighting ""currently includes the area surrounding the Shifa hospital but not the hospital itself"", a spokesperson for IDF told AFP.
The Israeli army also said its ground soldiers had hand-delivered 300 litres of fuel near the hospital ""for urgent medical purposes"".
The military shared grainy night-time footage of combat troops hauling jerry cans, leaving a dozen or more outside a building.
Al-Shifa director Mohammad Abu Salmiya said he told Israeli authorities he needed at least 8,000 litres to run the main generators and ""save hundreds of patients and wounded, but they refused.""
AFP was unable to independently verify his account or Israel's claim that Hamas forbade the hospital from taking the fuel.

Israel-Hamas war rages in besieged Gaza as Ramadan begins,"GAZA CITY - The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins Monday in Gaza with no truce in sight, as fighting rages between Israeli forces and Hamas militants and a dire humanitarian crisis grips the besieged Palestinian territory.
A Spanish charity ship with food aid prepared to sail from Cyprus to the coastal Gaza Strip, where the UN has repeatedly warned of famine.
Aid groups say only a fraction of the supplies required to meet basic humanitarian needs have been allowed into Gaza since October, when Israel placed it under near-total siege.
The non-governmental group Open Arms said its boat would tow a barge with 200 tonnes of food, which its partner the US charity World Central Kitchen would then unload on Gaza's shores.
It was expected to depart ""within the coming hours"", Cypriot government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis told Cyprus News Agency.
Jordanian, US, French, Belgian and Egyptian planes parachuted aid into northern Gaza on Sunday, but the United Nations' aid coordinator for the area has said boosting supply by land is the best way to get assistance to the territory's 2.4 million people.
Some of the airdropped food packages smashed open on impact, leaving residents picking through the dirt to salvage what they could, AFPTV images showed.
Weeks of talks involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have aimed for a six-week truce and the release of many of the hostages taken on October 7 that militants are still holding. In return, Israel would free Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.
The aim had been to halt the fighting by the start of Ramadan. 
Both sides have blamed each other for failing to reach a truce deal, after Israel demanded a full list of surviving hostages and Hamas called for Israel to pull out all its troops from Gaza.",Monday 11 March 2024 - 08:30am
Israeli minister lays out post-war Gaza plan as fighting rages,"Israel's defence minister has publicly presented for the first time proposals for the post-war administration of Gaza, where the military on Friday reported deadly overnight strikes.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant's plan for the ""day after"", shared with the media late Thursday but not yet adopted by Israel's war cabinet, says that neither Israel nor Hamas will govern Gaza and rejects future Jewish settlements there.
The minister's broad outline was unveiled on the eve of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's fourth trip to the region since a Hamas attack on October 7 triggered the war.
Questions over the future of the besieged Palestinian territory have been front of mind for many as calls mount for a ceasefire after nearly three months of devastating fighting.
Much of the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip has been reduced to rubble, while civilian deaths have soared and the UN has warned of a humanitarian crisis that has left hundreds of thousands displaced, facing famine and disease.
Bombing continued through the night in the southern areas of Khan Yunis and Rafah as well as parts of central Gaza, according to AFP correspondents.The Israeli army said its forces had ""struck over 100 targets"" across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including military positions, rocket launch sites and weapons depots.
A fighter jet hit the central area of Bureij overnight, killing ""an armed terrorist cell"" after what the army described in a statement as an attempted attack on an Israeli tank.
And ""a number"" of Palestinian militants were killed in clashes in Khan Yunis, a major city in southern Gaza that has become the focus of the fighting, the army said.
According to Gallant's proposed outline, the war will continue until Israel has dismantled Hamas's ""military and governing capabilities"" and secured the return of hostages taken on October 7.After Israel achieves its objectives -- for which the proposal sets no timeline -- Palestinian ""civil committees"" made up of will begin assuming the territory's governance, it said.
""Hamas will not govern Gaza, (and) Israel will not govern Gaza's civilians,"" according to the text, which offers little concrete details.
""Palestinian bodies will be in charge, with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the State of Israel.""
- Health 'collapse' -
Israel launched its campaign against Hamas after the militant group's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
The militants also took around 250 hostages, 132 of whom remain in captivity, according to Israel, including at least 24 believed to have been killed.Relentless Israeli bombardment and ground invasion have killed at least 22,438 people, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
Conditions for Gaza's civilians are precarious, with the United Nations estimating 1.9 million of the territory's 2.4 million people are displaced.
AFPTV footage showed entire families, seeking safety from the violence, arriving in the southern border city of Rafah in overloaded cars and on foot, pushing handcarts stacked with bedding and other possessions.
""We fled Jabalia camp to Maan (in Khan Yunis) and now we are fleeing from Maan to Rafah,"" said one woman who declined to give her name. ""(We have) no water, no electricity and no food.""
A spokesman for the UN refugee for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, told AFP that Rafah is overwhelmed by the influx.
""The city is usually home to only 250,000 persons. And now, it's more than 1.3 million,"" said Adnan Abu Hasna.""We have recently noticed a major collapse in health conditions"" and a ""significant spread"" of disease, he added.
On Thursday, the army reported more strikes in and around Gaza City, now a largely devastated urban combat zone, and Khan Yunis in the south.
It also said that an air strike in northern Gaza had killed the chief of operational staff for Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian militant group fighting alongside Hamas.
- 'Immediate measures' on aid -
During his visit, Blinken plans to discuss with Israeli leaders ""immediate measures to increase substantially humanitarian assistance to Gaza"", State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.Aid entering the besieged territory has slowed to a trickle during the war, even as a UN Security Council last month demanded the ""safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale"".
UN human rights chief Volker Turk on Thursday said he was ""very disturbed"" by recent comments from two far-right Israeli ministers who separately called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and for Israeli settlers to return, raising fears of mass expulsions.
Gallant's proposal, meanwhile, said that while Israel would reserve the right to operate inside the territory, there would be ""no Israeli civilian presence in the Gaza Strip"".
The war in Gaza has threatened to spill over into a wider regional conflict, with tensions brewing along the Israel-Lebanon border.It hit the south Beirut stronghold of the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, which has traded tit-for-tat fire across the border with Israel for months.Hezbollah has vowed that the killing on its home turf will not go unpunished, while Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi said troops on the border were ""in very high readiness"".
Rosie Scammell With Adel Zaanoun In The Gaza Strip",Friday 05 January 2024 - 12:50pm
"Famine imminent in north Gaza, 'unprecedented' crisis: UN","GAZA - Half of Gazans are experiencing ""catastrophic"" hunger, with famine projected to hit the north of the territory by May without urgent intervention, a United Nations-backed food security assessment warned on Monday.
""People in Gaza are starving to death right now. The speed at which this man-made hunger and malnutrition crisis has ripped through Gaza is terrifying,"" the head of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) Cindy McCain said.
""To have 50 percent of an entire population in catastrophic, near-famine levels, is unprecedented,"" Beth Bechdol, the deputy director general of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told AFP.
This amounts to around 1.1 million people ""struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation"", according to the WFP.
It added: ""This is the highest number of people ever recorded as facing catastrophic hunger"" under the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) partnership, which published its latest report on Monday.
The situation is particularly dire in the north of the besieged Palestinian territory, where there are about 300,000 people, the UN says -- and where aid agencies have reported huge difficulty distributing food and other aid.
Aid charity Oxfam on Monday accused Israel of continuing to ""systematically and deliberately block and undermine"" the delivery of aid into Gaza, in violation of international humanitarian law.
The IPC system, conducted by the UN and aid agencies, is used by the UN or governments in deciding whether or not to officially declare a famine.
""Famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime between mid-March and May 2024,"" the IPC report said of Gaza.
""All evidence points towards a major acceleration of deaths and malnutrition. Waiting for a retrospective famine classification before acting is indefensible,"" it said.
 
- 'Wasted' children -
 
A famine is declared when 20 percent of households face an extreme food shortage -- which is the case in Gaza, the UN says -- one in three children are acutely malnourished, and at least two in every 10,000 people die every day of starvation or malnutrition.
Children in Gaza face ""extremely critical health conditions... exposing them to high-risk nutritional deterioration"", the IPC report said.
According to the WFP, ""one in three children below the age of two is now acutely malnourished, or 'wasted'.
""This means they are dangerously thin for their height, which puts them at risk of death.""
Arif Husain, WFP's chief economist, warned the final criteria for declaring a famine -- the mortality rate -- would ""happen any time from now until the end of May"".
FAO's Bechdol said that challenges of data collection and analysis meant it was ""possible that famine is already occurring in the north"".
Gazans were ""turning to alternative sources"" for food, including animal feed and ""inedible items, purely out of desperation"", she told AFP.Donors have turned to deliveries by air or sea, but air and sea missions are no alternative to land deliveries, UN agencies say.
WFP said meeting basic food needs would require at least 300 trucks to enter Gaza every day and distribute food, especially in the north.
The agency has only managed to get nine convoys into the north since the start of the year, it said. 
The latest of these, on Sunday night, involved 18 truckloads of food supplies delivered to Gaza City.
""The convoy, the second to use a coordinated route into Gaza City and the north, delivered some 274 metric tons of wheat flour, food parcels and ready-to-eat rations. 
""This route needs to be made available for daily convoys and safe access to the north,"" it said.
The Rome-based agency said it needed Israel to ""provide more entry points into Gaza"" and allow use of the Ashdod port to bring in food aid.
The WFP's Husain said: ""Our hope is we can still avert a full-fledged famine.""
""But the window is shutting and it is shutting very, very fast"".

"'Tears, hugs' as two Gaza hostages rescued","There were hugs and tears at Israel's largest hospital on Monday as two Gaza hostages were reunited with their families after being rescued in a deadly military raid.
Louis Har, 70, and Fernando Simon Marman, 60, embraced relatives at Sheba hospital after being airlifted from Gaza's southern city of Rafah.
AFP journalists in Gaza saw the bodies of some of around 100 Palestinians killed in air strikes accompanying the rescue operation, according to a toll from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
Speaking from Sheba where the two rescued men were undergoing medical tests, Har's son-in-law described ""a lot of tears, hugs, not many words"".
""Luckily for us, as a family, they were saved tonight. But I must say that the job is not done,"" Idan Bejerano told journalists at Sheba hospital near Tel Aviv. 
""We are happy today, but we didn't win. It's just another step towards bringing all the other"" hostages home, he continued.
Bejerano told AFP the family had endured a ""tough"" and exhausting wait, trying to dispel rumours while militants released videos of some captives.
Dozens of press cameras filled the main hall of Sheba hospital, where patients were wheeled through by medics.
Marman's niece, Gefen Sigal Ilan, said she was still ""shaking"" from the news of her uncle's rescue. 
""When I saw him I couldn't believe he was real,"" she told AFP. 
She said the families of hostages will keep fighting for the release of other captives.
""I want to say we will not stop until all hostages are free... We will fight for their freedom,"" said Ilan, 36.The two men were taken captive from kibbutz Nir Yitzhak in southern Israel, so close to Rafah that the raid to rescue them could be heard from the rural community.
""From two o'clock in the morning, we started hearing booms and noises,"" said Moshe Schori, the kibbutz manager, adding that ""we couldn't sleep"".
""Only in the morning we saw on the news that they (Israeli forces) released two people who were in our kibbutz,"" he added, standing outside the home from which they were snatched on October 7.
- 'Time is running out' -
Talks have been underway for weeks to secure a second truce in the four-month war, which would see more hostages freed in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press on with the fight into Rafah, sparking international alarm for the 1.4 million Palestinians taking refuge there.
One Hamas leader told AFP such a move by Israeli forces would ""torpedo"" ceasefire negotiations.
A week-long truce in November secured the release of more than 100 Gaza hostages, in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israel.
Among those who had been released as part of that deal was Clara Marman, the partner of Louis Har and sister of Fernando Marman, as well as her sister Gabriela Leimberg and her 17-year-old daughter Mia Leimberg, according to the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum campaign group.
Speaking hours after his Israeli-Argentinian relative was freed, Bejerano urged leaders to ""be serious and strike a deal"".
""The Israeli people need the deal done. Not yesterday, not tomorrow, today. We want it done as soon as possible,"" he said.""Time is running out for the remaining hostages held captive by Hamas,"" it said in a statement.
""Their lives are at risk with each passing moment. The Israeli government must exhaust every option on the table to release them.""
Arnon Afek, director of Sheba hospital, said medical checks were being done on the two hostages.
""They are not young. We are checking them now. The time they will stay depends on their (medical) results,"" he told AFP.
""There are not only physical issues but also psychological issues. It is not a simple situation.""
During Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, militants seized around 250 hostages, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel says around 130 are still in Gaza, though 29 are thought to be dead.
The attack resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Israel has responded with a relentless offensive in Gaza that has killed at least 28,340 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll from territory's health ministry on Monday.

Babies evacuated from Gaza hospital UN agency dubs 'death zone',"More than 30 premature babies were evacuated Sunday from Gaza's largest hospital, said a health official in the Hamas-run territory, as Israel's army struck more targets in its war on the Palestinian militant group.
The World Health Organization (WHO) scrambled to evacuate the last remaining patients and staff from Al-Shifa hospital, describing it as a ""death zone"" after UN officials visited the facility raided earlier this week by Israeli troops.
Mohammed Zaqut, director general of Gaza's hospitals, told AFP that ""all 31 premature babies in Al-Shifa hospital... have been evacuated"" along with three doctors and two nurses.
""Preparations are under way"" for them to enter Egypt via the Rafah crossing, Zaqut said.Elsewhere in northern Gaza, a Hamas health official said more than 80 people were killed on Saturday in twin strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, the territory's largest, including on a UN school sheltering displaced people.
Israel has vowed to destroy Gaza's rulers Hamas over the October 7 attacks that it says killed 1,200 people and saw 240 hostages taken, in the worst-ever onslaught on the country.
In Gaza, the Hamas government says 12,300 have been killed in Israel's relentless aerial bombardment and ground operations.
Most of the casualties on both sides are civilians.
Israel said Saturday its military was ""expanding its operational activities in additional neighbourhoods... of the Gaza Strip"" where the UN says some 1.6 million people have been internally displaced by more than six weeks of fighting.The fighting has rendered more than half of Gaza's 36 hospitals non-functioning by shortages, combat or damage, the UN has said.
On Sunday, the WHO described dire conditions at Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital, with a mass grave at the entrance and nearly 300 patients left inside with 25 health workers.
It said it was planning ""the immediate evacuation of the remaining patients, staff and their families"".
But it warned that nearby facilities were already overstretched and urged an immediate ceasefire given the ""extreme suffering of the people of Gaza"".
The Israeli army said three soldiers were killed Saturday in fighting in northern Gaza, raising the number of troop deaths there to 62 since the war began.
- 'Horrifying' -
Israel this week showed AK-47 assault rifles and other military equipment it said had been found at Al-Shifa to support its claim -- rejected by Hamas -- that militants had been there.
On Saturday, hundreds fled the hospital on foot as loud explosions were heard around the complex.Columns of sick and injured were seen leaving with displaced people, doctors and nurses.
At least 15 bodies, some in advanced stages of decomposition, were strewn along the route, an AFP journalist said.
Medical charity Doctors without Borders (MSF) said one person was killed when its convoy came under attack Saturday while evacuating staff and family members from near Al-Shifa.
The WHO said 29 patients at the hospital with serious spinal injuries cannot move without medical assistance.
Israel has told Palestinians to move south for their safety, but deadly strikes continued there too.At least 26 people were killed in a strike that hit a residential building on Saturday, according to the director of the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, said he had seen ""horrifying images"" of Saturday's strike on the UN school in Jabalia, which Egypt called a ""war crime"".
The Israeli army said ""an incident in the Jabalia region"" was under review without elaborating.
- Fuel shipments -With just a trickle of aid allowed in from Egypt, Israel permitted a first consignment of fuel to enter Gaza late Friday under US pressure, allowing telecommunications to resume after a two-day blackout.
Some 120,000 litres of fuel arrived on Saturday, according to the UN. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government had vowed to keep aid out of Hamas's hands, said the fuel would power basic necessities like water pumps and sewage systems to prevent disease outbreak.
""The humanitarian assistance is also vital to ensure continued international support,"" he told a news conference.A US official has said more fuel deliveries and a ""significant pause"" in fighting would come ""when hostages are released"".
The White House denied a Washington Post report of a tentative agreement.
But Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on Sunday a deal to free hostages hinges on ""very minor"" practical issues, without elaborating.
- 'Not normal' -
Relatives of some of the hostages on Saturday marched to Netanyahu's Jerusalem office, demanding action to free them.""It's not normal to have children kidnapped for 43 days. We don't know what the government is doing, we don't have any information,"" said marcher Ari Levi.
The bodies of two female hostages were recovered in Gaza this week, the Israeli military said, while four abductees have so far been released by Hamas and a fifth rescued by troops.
Gaza's fate after the conflict remains unclear, and US President Joe Biden argued that the coastal territory and the Israeli-occupied West Bank should come under a single ""revitalised"" administration.
""As we strive for peace, Gaza and the West Bank should be reunited under a single governance structure, ultimately under a revitalised Palestinian Authority,"" he wrote in the Washington Post.
Netanyahu maintains that the Palestinian Authority ""in its current form is not capable of receiving responsibility for Gaza"".Since the Israel-Hamas war began, Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 200 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to Ramallah-based health ministry.
The Palestinian Red Crescent reported Sunday two deaths in overnight army raids in Jenin and the Bethlehem area.

"As Israel bombs Gaza, huge blasts kill dozens in refugee camp","GAZA - As Israel rained bombs on Gaza in its war with Hamas on Tuesday, huge explosions ripped through a crowded Palestinian refugee camp, killing dozens and leaving two giant craters in the densely populated area.
Wails filled the dusty air as volunteers clawed through the concrete blocks and twisted metal in a desperate search for survivors and bodies, with AFP video footage showing at least 47 corpses being recovered.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry reported an initial toll of more than 50 dead, 150 wounded and dozens buried under the rubble, and condemned what it called ""a heinous Israeli massacre"" at the Jabalia camp.
Israel did not immediately comment on the blasts or the reported toll in Jabalia, which is located in the territory's north outside Gaza City, an area where ground battles have raged nearby and Israel has told Palestinians to flee.
Israel launched its most intense military campaign ever on Gaza after suffering the bloodiest attack in its history when Hamas gunmen on October 7 killed some 1,400 people in a brutal cross-border raid, according to Israeli officials.One refugee camp resident, Ragheb Aqal, 41, likened the explosion to ""an earthquake"" and spoke of his horror at seeing ""homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers"".
The carnage came amid international warnings about the spiralling bloodshed and mounting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, on a day Israeli troops and Hamas militants had engaged in ""fierce battles"" in the north.
Israel reported two of its soldiers were killed inside Gaza.
Warplanes kept up a relentless barrage of strikes on Gaza, where the Hamas-run health ministry said -- before the Jabalia blasts -- that 8,525 people had died, including over 3,500 children.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed growing calls for a ceasefire with the Hamas group he has vowed to destroy while also seeking to liberate at least 240 hostages.
""Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism,"" he said late Monday.
""This will not happen.""Ahmed al-Kahlout, a Gazan living near an Orthodox church cultural centre destroyed in another strike, voiced the growing desperation inside the war-torn, crowded and besieged coastal territory.
""We want to live like any other people in this world, to live quietly,"" he said.
""We don't know what to do. The least they can do is give us a truce, give us three hours, a temporary truce or a ceasefire.""
- 'Stop these massacres' - 
The humanitarian toll has sparked global concern, with aid groups and the United Nations warning time is running out for many of the territory's 2.4 million people denied access to food, water, fuel and medicine.Surgeons are conducting amputations on hospital floors without anaesthetic, and children are forced to drink salty water, said Jean-Francois Corty, vice-president of Medecins du Monde, which has 20 staff on the ground.
Israel has accused Hamas of using hospitals as military headquarters and civilians as ""human shields"" -- charges the group dismisses as ""baseless"" propaganda.
At a funeral in southern Gaza, tearful mourners cradled the bodies of relatives wrapped in white shrouds before burying them with their bare hands.
""We ask the world to show sympathy for the children to stop these massacres,"" Yusef Hijazi, the grandfather of one victim, told AFP.As even Israel's staunchest allies voiced concern about the humanitarian crisis, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA said there was not nearly enough aid to meet the ""unprecedented"" needs.
""When an eight-year-old tells you that she doesn't want to die, it's hard not to feel helpless,"" said UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths.
Hisham Adwan, Gaza director of the Rafah crossing with Egypt where some aid has been allowed in, said 36 trucks had been waiting there since the previous day.
""I feel that it's extremely slow and there's disruption to UNRWA's work, and we don't know why,"" he said.
Israel said it is inspecting cargo to make sure weapons are not being smuggled in, and monitoring to guarantee Hamas does not seize the supplies.
- 'Great sorrow' - 
The army on Monday rescued Private Ori Megidish, an Israeli soldier in Hamas captivity who was reunited with her family.But there was heartbreak for relatives of another missing woman, 23-year-old German-Israeli Shani Louk, abducted from a music festival then ""tortured and paraded around Gaza"", according to Israel's foreign ministry.
Her remains were found Monday, with her sister Adi voicing her ""great sorrow"" as she shared news of her death on social media.
Other families have endured an unbearable wait for news of relatives seized by Hamas and thought to be held in a labyrinth of tunnels deep below Gaza.Hadas Kalderon walked through the scorched homes of the Nir Oz kibbutz, near Israel's border with Gaza, where gunmen killed her mother and niece and kidnapped her 12-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter.
""I don't have any control and knowledge about army actions, I just know my children are still there in the middle of a war,"" said the 56-year-old.
""It's a disaster. It's really hell. There is no word to express this.""
- 'Very primitive' -
Meanwhile, in a sign that the conflict risked spiralling throughout the region, Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels fired drones and missiles towards Israel and vowed to keep up attacks.Israel's army also said it had intercepted a missile fired from the Red Sea region.
Israel's military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, whose caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati told AFP it was his ""duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war"".Anis Abla, head of Lebanon's Civil Defense Centre in Marjayoun, near the Israeli border, said they were completely unprepared for war.
""Our equipment is very primitive and there is a shortage of all tools, such as fire suits and extinguisher cylinders,"" he told AFP.

"99 journalists killed in 2023, 77 in Gaza war: report","GAZA CITY - Seventy-seven of the 99 journalists killed in 2023 were killed in the Israel-Hamas war, making the last 12 months the deadliest for the media in almost a decade, the Committee to Protect Journalists said.
Killings of reporters would have dropped globally year-on-year had it not been for the deaths in that conflict, the CPJ said, although fatalities were stable in Somalia and the Philippines.
The toll is the highest since 2015 and an increase of nearly 44 percent on 2022's figures.
""In December 2023, CPJ reported that more journalists were killed in the first three months of the Israel-Gaza war than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year,"" the CPJ said.
The vast majority of the 77 journalists killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict -- 72 of them -- were Palestinian, the organization said. Three Lebanese and two Israelis were also killed.
""Journalists in Gaza are bearing witness on the frontlines,"" said CPJ chief executive Jodie Ginsberg. 
""The immense loss suffered by Palestinian journalists in this war will have long-term impacts for journalism not just in the Palestinian territories but for the region and beyond. Every journalist killed is a further blow to our understanding of the world.""
On February 7, the New York-based press freedom organization said the number of journalists killed in the Gaza conflict had risen to 85. 
CPJ has previously attacked what it calls ""persecution"" of journalists by Israeli forces, and is investigating whether a dozen journalists killed in the Gaza conflict were deliberately targeted by Israeli soldiers, which would constitute ""a war crime.""
Israel vowed to crush Hamas in response to the Islamist group's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. 
Militants also took around 250 people hostage, in the deadliest-ever attack in the country, and around 130 of them are believed to remain in Gaza, including 29 who are believed to be dead. 
At least 28,576 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's retaliatory military offensive on Gaza, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.
The greatest reductions in journalist fatalities were registered in Ukraine and Mexico, which both went from 13 killings to two.
One of those killed in Ukraine was AFP journalist Arman Soldin. Soldin, 32, died when his reporting team came under fire near the eastern city of Bakhmut.
The CPJ warned that Mexico, along with the Philippines and Somalia, was ""one of the world's deadliest countries for the press.""
""Compounding the situation, government agencies spy on reporters and rights defenders, and a significant number of journalists have had to leave their homes, and abandon their professions, due to violence,"" the CPJ report warned.",Friday 16 February 2024 - 07:30am
Gazans amid the rubble of homes flattened by fighting,"GAZA - After her house was levelled by an Israeli strike, Najah Nabhan wonders what will become of her and dozens of relatives left homeless by the latest fighting to hit Gaza. 
""I'd barely reached the street, then the house was bombed,"" said Nabhan, standing next to the mangled heap of concrete slabs and breeze blocks that had been the family home.
Dozens of homes were destroyed during five days of fighting, which erupted when the Israeli military launched deadly strikes on top militants from the Islamic Jihad militant group.
Nabhan, 56, has been trying to care for her children and grandchildren, many of whom have disabilities, since they were left homeless on Saturday.""I borrow clothes from the neighbours for them. I didn't take anything with me,"" she said, in the Bir al-Najeh neighbourhood of northern Gaza.
The family said they were warned in a phone call from the Israeli military that a strike was imminent, but the army did not detail why it targeted the house when asked by AFP.
In total, 103 homes were completely destroyed and 140 severely damaged in the fighting, the United Nations said Tuesday, citing officials in Gaza.
Belal Nabhan, 35, earns just 10 shekels ($2.70) a day selling parsley in the market, and said he remains in a state of shock.
""People were screaming and we ran away... now 45 people are staying here, where will they go? They need shelter,"" he said, indicating relatives resting beside the rubble.Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, which is ruled by Islamist group Hamas, have fought multiple wars in recent years.
The ruins of past conflicts -- such as a three-day escalation in August which killed 49 Gazans -- are dotted across the densely populated Palestinian territory.
With Gaza's poverty rate at 53-percent, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, few people can afford to rebuild their homes.
- 'My dreams are gone' -
 In Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, children clambered atop a huge mound of concrete and rebar flattened by Israeli bombardment. 
In the tightly-packed neighbourhood, Mohammed Zidan's home escaped a direct hit but the blast was so powerful it blew out the walls.
""Because you want to strike one person, you don't need to destroy a whole apartment complex,"" said the 29-year-old.
""I'm a young man, living in my house, with my children in my home. I'm focusing on my work. What's my fault, that you make me pay the price?""
As Zidan stepped over the remains of his bedroom on Monday, Palestinians elsewhere were commemorating the Nakba, or catastrophe. It marks the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes, in the war which erupted when Israel was created in 1948.
""We will stay living the life of the Nakba, continuously,"" said Zidan, who has taken to sleeping on the street behind his home.
The Israeli military did not immediately respond to an enquiry from AFP on why it targeted the neighbourhood.
A fragile ceasefire has largely held since late Saturday, ending the repeated rounds of Israeli strikes and volleys of rocket fire launched by Palestinian militants. 
The fighting killed 33 people in Gaza, including children as well as militants, and two civilians in Israel.Sitting in a donated wheelchair in Bir al-Najeh, Haneen Nabhan said she fainted when she heard her home was destroyed.
""I used to take medicine, but the medicine's in the rubble,"" she said. 
""All my dreams were in the house, and my dreams are gone.""",Tuesday 16 May 2023 - 14:03pm
Grim cycle of death at a hospital in Gaza,"GAZA - A middle-aged man with a blank, shattered expression walked slowly down a ramp at the hospital, gently cradling in his arms a tiny body wrapped in a white shroud.
After the collapse of a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas, the Nasser hospital's morgue in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, was full once again on Saturday.
A handful of women wept for their own children, while a group of men nearby prayed for the dead.
""My son Mohammed tried to get the women and children out of our tent"" at a makeshift camp where they had sheltered inside a school, Jumana Murad said of the 19-year-old.
""But a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head... I saw his brains,"" she told AFP, before bursting into tears.
The family had left their home in Gaza City after the Israeli army told around 1.1 million people in the north of the Palestinian territory to move to avoid the fighting following Hamas militants' unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel.
""They tossed out leaflets to tell us 'you will be safe in the south', so we went there,"" she said.
""My son is dead, my son Mohammed, who was a nice boy, and who listened to me whenever I needed to get something off my chest.""
At her side, her daughter Joelle Murad shook in her red embroidered dressing gown, screaming out to God and to anyone in earshot.
""Why was my brother, who had nothing to do with militant groups, killed?"" she cried. ""What did we do? They want Hamas? What does that have to do with us?""
 
- Last look -
 
On October 7, Hamas fighters broke through the militarised border with Israel killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and seizing around 240 hostages, Israeli officials say.
Since then, except for a one-week pause that ended on Friday, Israel's army has pounded the Gaza Strip from the air, sea and ground in a campaign to destroy the group.More than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, have been killed in Gaza as a result, according to the territory's Hamas government.
On Saturday it added another 240 to the toll -- the number killed since the truce expired.
Men at Nasser hospital -- doctors, medical technicians, victims' loved ones -- brought out the corpses in white body bags.
Families gathered for one last look at the dead, caressing their hair, touching their hands or kissing their faces, sometimes still stained with blood.
To Gazans, the dead are ""martyrs"", so their bodies are not given the traditional Muslim funeral cleansing.
The bodies are carried out on stretchers, or on long metal trays from the morgue's cold rooms -- where electricity supplies are intermittent to non-existent.
Funerals are carried out quickly, and family members cannot always be reached, but the small crowd in the courtyard paused and gathered before all the bodies, reciting prayers for the dead.
The wrapped remains were loaded into ill-suited civilian vehicles -- ambulances are only for the living -- and taken away to rapidly filling cemeteries.
Behind them, more bodies were coming out of the morgue, one more mother cried for her son and the crowd readied for another funeral prayer.

"Facing pressure, Security Council to vote on new Gaza ceasefire call","GAZA - The United Nations Security Council will vote Monday on a new resolution calling for an ""urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities"" in Gaza, as Washington exhibits growing impatience with key ally Israel. 
READ: Israel faces mounting outrage over Gaza war
The vote comes days after the United States blocked a previous Security Council resolution that would have called for a ""humanitarian ceasefire"" in the battered Palestinian territory, where Israel continues its deadly strikes in retaliation for Hamas's unprecedented attack on October 7. 
But in the General Assembly, the UN's 193 members voted overwhelmingly for a ceasefire, with 153 in favor -- exceeding the 140 or so countries that have routinely backed resolutions condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. 
The upcoming Security Council resolution was introduced by Arab countries that had come away from last Tuesday's General Assembly vote bolstered by such broad international support, though the latest text's fate remains uncertain.
The new draft, drawn up by the United Arab Emirates and seen by AFP, calls for an ""urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza Strip.""
It also affirms support for a two-state solution in the region and ""stresses the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.""
In a move criticized by Israel and the United States, the draft does not explicitly name Hamas, though it does call for the ""immediate and unconditional release of all hostages"" and condemns ""all indiscriminate attacks against civilians.""
 
- 'Protect civilians' -
 
Ahead of the vote on Monday, Israel reiterated its criticisms.
""A ceasefire that leaves Hamas in power with impunity and with the desire and capability to repeat October 7 again and again and again is simply unacceptable,"" Tal Heinrich, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, said in a briefing.
The Security Council has faced sharp international opprobrium as it has managed to pass only one resolution on Gaza since the start of the war, in which the 15-member body called for ""humanitarian pauses"" -- after five other resolutions were rejected, including two thanks to American vetoes. 
According to diplomatic sources, negotiations on the new text continued Sunday in an effort to avoid another impasse, days after US President Joe Biden warned that Israel was at risk of losing international support due to its ""indiscriminate"" bombing of Gaza. 
""The United States should now back those words by acting at the United Nations Security Council to pressure Israel, as well as Palestinian armed groups, to comply with international humanitarian law and protect civilians,"" Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at Human Rights Watch said, telling Washington: ""Don't use vetoes to block resolutions aimed at stopping mass atrocities."" 
Security Council resolutions are technically binding, but are often ignored by the countries involved. 
According to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, some 18,800 people, mostly civilians and children, have died since Israeli bombardment began in Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's October 7 attack.
Attack by Hamas left 1,139 people dead in Israel, also mostly civilians, and saw some 250 people kidnapped, according to an AFP tally based on the latest official Israeli figures.  
""In the face of such atrocities, there is only one moral position, one defensible position: Ceasefire now, ceasefire now, ceasefire now,"" Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour said Friday. 
But his Israel counterpart Gilad Erdan countered: ""Calling for a ceasefire now, while (hostages) are still being held, is the most immoral thing to do.""

"Families forced to wait as Israel, Hamas truce deal delayed","Families of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and of Palestinians detained by Israel waited Thursday for at least one more day after a breakthrough four-day truce deal was put on hold.
The delay is the latest blow to the families desperate to see their loved ones return home, and to Gazans praying for an end to 47 days of war and deprivation.
The deal saw Israel and Hamas agree to the truce which could be extended and broadened.
It is also intended to provide aid to Gaza's 2.4 million residents struggling to survive with shortages of food, water and fuel.Instead of a pause, fighting continued on Thursday. Explosions were heard on an AFPTV livecam followed by heavy grey clouds rolling over the territory's north, much of which has been reduced to rubble.
""We've already been on an emotional roller coaster for 47 days. Today is no different,"" said Eyal Kalderon, a cousin of Ofer Kalderon, who is among those held captive in Gaza.
Hamas and other Palestinian gunmen seized about 240 hostages during unprecedented raids into Israel on October 7 which Israel says killed around 1,200 people, most of them civilians.
- Release 'will take place' -
The attack prompted a relentless Israeli campaign of bombing and a ground offensive in Gaza, where the Hamas government says more than 14,100 people, also mostly non-combatants, have been killed.Israel's national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi indicated the phased release of at least 50 hostages in return for 150 Palestinian prisoners would still go ahead but not on Thursday as expected.
""The start of the release will take place according to the original agreement between the sides, and not before Friday,"" he said in a statement.
On both sides it would free mostly women and people aged 18 and under.
An Israeli official source, speaking to AFP Thursday on condition of anonymity, blamed the delay on ""additional demands by Hamas"", but did not give details.
A Palestinian official with knowledge of the negotiation process, who also asked not to be named, said the delay stemmed from ""last minute"" details over which hostages would be released and how.
The Palestinians are to be freed from three Israeli jails.Nations around the world welcomed the deal, with some expressing hope it will lead to a lasting end to the war.
""This cannot be just a pause before the massacre starts all over again,"" Riyad Mansour, Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council.
Israeli officials, however, say the truce will be only temporary.
""We are not ending the war. We will continue until we are victorious,"" Israel's chief of staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, told troops he visited in Gaza, according to the army.
- Weeks of talks -
The president of Iran, which backs Hamas and is Israel's arch enemy, said on Thursday that Israel has already been ""defeated"" and ""the Palestinian people and resistance won a great victory.""
The holdup in implementing the release deal came after weeks of talks involving Israel, Palestinian militant groups, Qatar, Egypt and the United States.
Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said Thursday that implementation of the accord ""continues and is going positively"".Three Americans, including three-year-old Abigail Mor Idan, were among those earmarked to be freed.
Israel's aerial bombardment continued overnight Wednesday-Thursday on targets in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, sending red and yellow fireballs and immense columns of black smoke into the air.
Homes shook several kilometres away in Rafah, AFP journalists said.
""I think there are still about 20 people under the rubble,"" said one Palestinian looking for survivors under a destroyed building east of Khan Yunis.
Thousands of children have been killed in Gaza, ""the most dangerous place in the world to be a child"", said Catherine Russell, executive director of the UN children's fund, UNICEF.Youngsters are among the estimated 1.7 million Gazans who, according to the UN, have had to flee their homes during the fighting.
Hospital patients have also been forced to move, the latest being 190 wounded and sick, along with their companions and medical teams, from Al-Shifa hospital on Wednesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.
Under pressure to back up its claims that Hamas had a command centre under Al-Shifa, Israel's military on Wednesday escorted journalists to a tunnel shaft which soldiers said was part of a vast Hamas underground military network.
The army led reporters into underground facilities with air-conditioning, a toilet and what looked like a kitchenette.Hamas and medical staff have denied a command centre is under Al-Shifa, Gaza's largest hospital.
Israeli forces arrested Al-Shifa's director Mohammad Abu Salmiya and other medical personnel, another doctor told AFP on Thursday.
Since the Israel-Hamas war began, deadly exchanges of fire have occurred across Israel's northern border, mainly between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.
These clashes have raised fears of a broader conflagration.
- Tearful refuge -
Hezbollah said Thursday that its chief, Hassan Nasrallah, met with Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian to discuss ""the efforts made to end the Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip"".Further south, the destroyer USS Thomas Hudner in the Red Sea ""shot down multiple one-way attack drones launched from Huthi-controlled areas in Yemen"", United States Central Command said, referring to the Iran-backed rebel group.
Displaced Gazans remained sceptical about the Israel-Hamas deal.
Fatima Achour, a Palestinian lawyer in her 40s, burst into tears when she reached Egypt through the Rafah border crossing, becoming one of the few Gazans allowed to leave because she has a foreign passport.
""There's no city to go back to... There are no houses. Our lives have ended,"" she said. ""This truce is not for us.""",Thursday 23 November 2023 - 16:34pm
One million Gazans flee as Israel readies for ground attack,"ISRAEL - More than one million people have fled their homes in Gaza in scenes of chaos and despair as Israel bombarded the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip and continued amassing troops Monday in preparation for a full-blown ground invasion.
Israel declared war on the Islamist group a day after waves of its fighters broke through the heavily fortified border on October 7, shooting, stabbing and burning to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.Israel then unleashed a relentless bombing campaign of Gaza that has flattened neighbourhoods and left at least 2,670 people dead in the territory, mainly civilians.
Palestinians carrying whatever belongings they can, in bags and suitcases, or packed onto three-wheeled motorbikes, battered cars, vans and even donkey carts have become a common sight.
Fleeing the bombardment and following an Israeli order to move to the south of the Gaza Strip, people have had to find shelter wherever they can, including on the streets and in UN-run schools.
""No electricity, no water, no internet. I feel like I'm losing my humanity,"" said Mona Abdel Hamid, 55, who fled Gaza City to Rafah in the south of the enclave, and is having to stay with strangers.
US President Joe Biden said in an interview with the CBS news programme 60 Minutes that while invading and ""taking out the extremists"" was needed, any move to occupy the territory would be a ""big mistake"".
 
- 'Verge of abyss' -
 
A bereaved and infuriated Israel has massed forces outside the long-blockaded enclave of 2.4 million in preparation for what the army has said would be a land, air and sea attack involving a ""significant ground operation"".
Hamas backer Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah, which is also supported by Tehran, have warned that an invasion would be met with a response. 
""No one can guarantee the control of the situation and the non-expansion of the conflicts"" if Israel sends its soldiers into Gaza, said Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.
Fire along the Israeli-Lebanese border has intensified in the last week, prompting Israel to shutter the area to civilians.
On Sunday, a rocket hit the UN peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah attacks killed one person in Israel, the Israeli military said.
More than 10 people have been killed in Lebanon and at least two in Israel in the past week.
Among those killed in Lebanon was a Reuters journalist, Issam Abdallah.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due back in Israel on Monday after a crisis tour of Middle Eastern countries in a frantic attempt to avert a wider crisis in the volatile region.
But as Israel seeks to avenge the worst attack in its history, the Arab League and African Union warned the invasion could lead to ""a genocide of unprecedented proportions"".
UN chief Antonio Guterres has warned that the entire region was ""on the verge of the abyss"".- Escalation risk -
 
Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said his country had ""no interest in a war in the north, we don't want to escalate the situation"".
The United States, which has given unequivocal backing to Israel, has sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean as a deterrent.
The White House has voiced fears at the prospect of Iran becoming ""directly engaged"", after it praised the Hamas attack but insisted it was not involved.
But asked in the 60 Minutes interview whether US troops might join the war, Biden said ""I don't think that's necessary"".
""Israel has one of the finest fighting forces in the country. I guarantee we're gonna provide them everything they need,"" he said. The United States has also appealed to China to use its influence in the region to ease tensions.
On Sunday Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Israel's response had ""gone beyond the scope of self-defence"", and demanded that it ""cease its collective punishment of the people of Gaza"". 
 
- Aid agencies' alarm - 
 
Massing thousands of troops and heavy weaponry in the desert south of the country, the Israeli military has said it is awaiting the ""political"" green light to go into northern Gaza. 
The army has told 1.1 million Palestinians in the north of the Gaza Strip to head to the south of the enclave.But Israeli air strikes were continuing in the south, including in Khan Yunis and Rafah, where one resident said a doctor's house was targeted.
""All the family was wiped out,"" said Khamis Abu Hilal.
The UN said Monday that 47 entire families, amounting to around 500 people, have been wiped out in Israel's bombing campaign.Foreign governments and aid agencies, including the UN and Red Cross, have repeatedly criticised Israel's evacuation order.
The UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees said Sunday that some one million Palestinians had already been displaced in the first week of the conflict -- but the number was likely to be higher.
Lynn Hastings, the UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, decried that Israel was connecting humanitarian aid into Gaza with the release of scores of hostages seized during the Hamas attack.
""Neither should be conditional,"" she insisted in a video posted by the UN.
""They have said they want to destroy Hamas, but their current trajectory is going to destroy Gaza.""
 
- Evacuations -
 
In Gaza, hospitals are becoming overwhelmed with increasing numbers of dead and injured.Health officials on Sunday said some 9,600 people have been wounded.
Israeli energy minister Israel Katz on Sunday said water supplies to southern Gaza had been switched back on.
But power outages threaten to cripple life-support systems, from sea water desalination plants to food refrigeration and hospital incubators.
Even everyday functions -- from going to the toilet, showering and washing clothes -- are almost impossible, locals said.
Gazans are effectively trapped, with Israeli-controlled crossings closed and Egypt also having shut the Rafah border in the south.
Blinken said he was confident the crossing ""will be open"" for aid into the strip, amid reports that Egypt was blocking the passage of Gazans with foreign passports until relief supplies are allowed in. 
- Hostages -
 
The mood in Israel has swung between collective grief, fury and a strong desire to punish Hamas, which Netanyahu has likened to the Islamic State group. It is proscribed as a terrorist group by several Western governments, including the United States.
There are deep fears about the safety of 155 hostages that Hamas has taken to the Gaza Strip.
""We must bring them back home alive,"" said a tearful Yrat Zailer, the aunt of children aged nine months and four years whom Hamas abducted along with their mother.
Israel said last week it had found the bodies of 1,500 Islamist militants in southern towns near the Palestinian enclave recaptured by the army.
Planeloads of Israelis have returned from around the world to join the latest of the many wars in their country's 75-year history.

Israel says 20 militants killed at key Gaza hospital,"GAZA - Israel's military said 20 Palestinian militants were killed Monday and dozens detained during a raid on Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital that targeted ""senior Hamas terrorists"".
Soldiers rolled in with tanks and air strikes hit the area around the Hamas-ruled territory's biggest medical centre, a complex crowded with patients and displaced people.
""Twenty terrorists have been eliminated at Al-Shifa hospital thus far in various engagements, and dozens of apprehended suspects are currently in questioning,"" the army said in a statement.
Israel earlier reported the ""elimination"" of Fayq al-Mabhouh, a man they identified as a Hamas internal security official. A Gaza police source confirmed his death, saying Mabhouh was a brigadier general in the force.
The latest military operation around the hospital -- which was raided by Israeli troops before, in November, sparking an international outcry -- triggered alarm from the World Health Organization.
""We are terribly worried about the situation at Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
""Hospitals should never be battlegrounds.""
An AFP journalist witnessed air strikes on buildings in the area around the hospital and reported seeing ""hundreds of people, mostly children, women, and the elderly, fleeing their homes"".
Israel has repeatedly said the complex housed an underground Hamas control base, a claim denied by the militants.
Tedros said that Al-Shifa had ""only recently restored minimal health services"".Most of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning, according to the United Nations. 
The Israeli military reported gun battles at the Al-Shifa compound including one that it said killed Mabhouh.
""Numerous weapons were located in the room adjacent to where he was eliminated,"" the military said.
Fayq al-Mabhouh is the brother of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, one of the founders of the armed wing of Hamas, according to family members.
Mahmoud al-Mabhouh was killed in 2010 in Dubai, in a hit which United Arab Emirates investigators suspected was the work of Mossad, the Israeli spy agency.
Israel said the Al-Shifa ""operation is based on intelligence information indicating the use of the hospital by senior Hamas terrorists"".
On Monday, the army released a video showing what it said were weapons and money seized from the hospital which had been used by Hamas and another armed group, Islamic Jihad.
In January Israel's army said it had ""completed the dismantling"" of Hamas's command structure in the northern Gaza Strip, where Al-Shifa is located.
The military has carried out operations at other hospitals in Gaza since war broke out on October 7, when Hamas militants attacked Israel from Gaza.
The unprecedented attack resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Gaza militants also seized about 250 hostages, of whom Israel believes 130 remain in Gaza, including 33 who are presumed dead.
Israel has carried out a relentless bombing campaign and ground offensive that Gaza's health ministry says has killed at least 31,726 people, most of them women and children.

Sky above Gaza turns red in deadly night of strikes,"GAZA - The bodies arrived through the night at the morgue of a hospital in Deir al-Balah in the centre of the Gaza Strip.
READ: Israel intensifies Gaza strikes despite ceasefire calls
By Monday morning, hospital director Iyad al-Jabri had counted 58 dead, saying ""dozens of women and children"" may still be buried under the rubble.
Overnight, the skies over the Palestinian coastal territory were streaked with flashes of yellow and plumes of red.
It came as the Israeli army said its land assault on Gaza had split the narrow territory in two and warned of ""significant"" strikes as part of its campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the militants' 7 October attacks.
Since Hamas unleashed the attacks, around 1,400 people, mainly civilians, have been killed in Israel and more than 240 have been taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.
In Gaza, more than 10,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes, most of them women and children, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said in an updated toll issued on Monday.
At least 292 Palestinians were killed overnight from Sunday into Monday in intense Israeli army bombardments, Gaza's Hamas-controlled health ministry said Monday.
On the ground in Gaza, Mohammed Meshmesh, 54, said he had lost several members of his family in the Israeli strikes.""It's a ferocious campaign,"" Meshmesh told AFP. ""The strikes have increased and the victims are women and children, just civilians.""
""We weren't expecting this. Communications were cut,"" he said.

On Sunday night, for the third time since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, Gaza's 2.4 million inhabitants spent the night cut off from the outside world and with no way to contact their friends and relatives.
 
- 'Earthquake' -
 
Meshmesh, who recently left the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, said he only heard about the death of his relatives at dawn.When the bombs were falling on the neighbourhood of Al-Mashaala in Deir al-Balah, his cousin Mahmud Radwan Meshmesh likewise was unable to call an ambulance.
""We had to send someone in a car to take the first dead to the morgue, and tell the ambulances so that they could come get the bodies,"" the 47-year-old said.
""These are massacres! They destroyed three houses on top of the residents, women and children.
""There were more than 60 people in these homes and we have already pulled out 40 bodies from the debris.""
When the bombs fell on the buildings, ""it was like an earthquake... an absolutely enormous explosion"", he said.

Mohammed Abu Laila thought he would be away from harm in the centre of the Gaza Strip.The 34-year-old Palestinian left with his family from their home in Al-Saftawi after the Israeli army called on 1.1 million Gazans in the north to move south as it began its offensive.
But around 11:00 pm on Sunday, in the Nuseirat refugee camp where he had set up, ""we felt a strike and we found ourselves under the rubble"", Laila said.
""We were 120 people in the house. Many were killed or injured,"" he said.
""We have already said the prayer for the dead for around 50 people.""
 
By Adel Zaanoun",Monday 06 November 2023 - 15:40pm
Israel deploys new military AI in Gaza war,"TEL AVIV - Israel's army has deployed some AI-enabled military technology in combat for the first time in Gaza, raising fears about the use of autonomous weapons in modern warfare.
The army has hinted at what the new tech is being used for, with spokesman Daniel Hagari saying last month that Israel's forces were operating ""above and underground simultaneously"".
A senior defence official told AFP the tech was destroying enemy drones and mapping Hamas's vast tunnel network in Gaza.
New defence technologies including artificial intelligence-powered gunsights and robotic drones form a bright spot in an otherwise dire period for Israel's tech industry.
The sector accounted for 18 percent of GDP in 2022, but the war in Gaza has wreaked havoc with an estimated eight percent of its workforce called up to fight.
""In general the war in Gaza presents threats, but also opportunities to test emerging technologies in the field,"" said Avi Hasson, chief executive of Startup Nation Central, an Israeli tech incubator.
""Both on the battlefield and in the hospitals there are technologies that have been used in this war that have not been used in the past.""
But the rising civilian death toll shows that much greater oversight is needed over the use of new forms of defence tech, Mary Wareham, an arms expert at Human Rights Watch, told AFP.
""Now we're facing the worst possible situation of death and suffering that we're seeing today –- some of that is being brought about by the new tech,"" she said.
More than 150 countries in December backed a UN resolution identifying ""serious challenges and concerns"" in new military tech, including ""artificial intelligence and autonomy in weapons systems.""
 
- 'Angry Birds' -
 
Hamas on October 7 launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, resulting in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Hamas also seized around 250 hostages, and Israel says some 132 remain in Gaza including at least 29 believed to have been killed.
Israel's military response has killed nearly 28,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry.
Like many other modern conflicts, the war has been shaped by a proliferation of inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, which have made attacks from the air easier and cheaper.
Hamas used them to drop explosives on October 7, while Israel has turned to new tech to shoot them down.
In a first, the army has used an AI-enabled optic sight, made by Israeli startup Smart Shooter, which is attached to weapons such as rifles and machine guns. 
""It helps our soldiers to intercept drones because Hamas uses a lot of drones,"" said the senior defence official.
""It makes every regular soldier -- even a blind soldier -- a sniper.""
Another system to neutralise drones involves deploying a friendly drone with a net that it can throw around the enemy craft to neutralise it.
""It's drone versus drone -- we call it Angry Birds,"" the official said.
 
- Hamas tunnels -
 
A pillar of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's vow to ""destroy"" Hamas is quickly mapping the underground tunnel network where Israel says the group's fighters are hiding and holding hostages.The network is so vast that the army has dubbed it the ""Gaza Metro"" and a recent study by US military academy West Point said there were 1,300 tunnels stretching over 500 kilometres (310 miles).
To map the tunnels the army has turned to drones that use AI to learn to detect humans and can operate underground, including one made by Israel startup Robotican that encases a drone inside a robotic case.
It is being used in Gaza ""to enter into tunnels and to see as far as the communication lets you,"" the senior Israeli defence official said.
Before the war the technology did not allow drones to operate underground because of issues sending images to the surface, the official added.
The conflict has raised human rights concerns but also cemented Israel's status as a world-leading manufacturer of cutting-edge defence systems.
The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the United States -- Israel's main international ally and provider of billions of dollars each year in military aid -- was training its own soldiers to shoot down drones using Smart Shooter's optic sights.
In late January, three US soldiers were killed in a drone attack on a base in Jordan.

UN Security Council struggles to 'speak with one voice' on Gaza,"NEW YORK - The UN Security Council is struggling to find a unified voice on the war in Gaza, recently swapping a call for a ""lasting cessation of hostilities"" with a draft resolution demanding the fighting's ""suspension.""
Even still, members of the council are grappling to find common ground: though a vote on the resolution is scheduled Tuesday, after being postponed Monday, it might be delayed again, diplomatic sources tell AFP.
Israel -- backed by its ally Washington, a veto-wielding permanent Security Council member -- has opposed the term ""cease-fire."" This is one of the sticking points for the divided body to navigate as diplomats call for a ""pause"" or a ""truce,"" or try to qualify any cease-fire as ""humanitarian.""  
""The negotiations are complex but we hope to see the council speak with one voice today,"" said the United Arab Emirates' ambassador to the UN, Lana Zaki Nusseibeh.  
The current struggle comes after an impasse earlier this month, when the United States, despite unprecedented pressure from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, blocked the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the war. 
It had called for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"" in the Gaza Strip, where Israel continues its deadly strikes in retaliation for Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack.
Last week, the General Assembly adopted the same nonbinding resolution by 153 votes to 10, with 23 abstentions, out of 193 member states.
On the strength of that overwhelming support, Arab countries announced the new attempt at the Security Council.
A draft text prepared by the UAE, obtained by AFP on Sunday, called for ""an urgent and lasting cessation of hostilities to allow unimpeded access of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.""
But according to diplomatic sources, a new, modified text is now on the table, in an attempt to inch toward a compromise.
It is less direct, calling for ""the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities."" 
 
- Aid 'far short' of need -
 
As in previous texts, Hamas is not named in the current draft resolution -- a move that has in the past drawn ire from the United States.
Instead, it ""firmly"" condemns ""all indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian objects... and all acts of terrorism.""
It also demands ""the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.""
The new draft text also calls on the parties in the conflict to facilitate the entry and distribution of aid across all of the Gaza Strip, as well as for Guterres to put in place a monitoring system for such aid.
Senior United Nations official Tor Wennesland said on Tuesday that Israel's steps to allow aid into Gaza until now have been ""far short of what is needed.""
""The delivery of humanitarian aid in the (Gaza) Strip continues to face nearly insurmountable challenges,"" said Wennesland, the organization's special coordinator for the Middle East peace process.
""Amid displacement at an unimaginable scale and active hostilities, the humanitarian response system is on the brink. Limited steps by Israel... are positive, but fall far short of what is needed to address the human catastrophe on the ground.""
Earlier in the day, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said his country was ""ready for another humanitarian pause and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages.""
- Growing impatience -
 
Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, the Security Council has been under fire, having only managed to adopt a single text, in mid-November, calling for humanitarian ""pauses"" of a few days to allow aid into the Palestinian territory.
Five other draft resolutions were rejected, two of them due to US vetoes.
President Joe Biden meanwhile has exhibited growing impatience with Israel, warning that its ally risks losing the support of the international community for its ""indiscriminate"" bombardment of the Gaza Strip. 
After the attack on October 7, which Israeli authorities say left around 1,140 people dead, most of them civilians, Israel vowed to ""annihilate"" Hamas, pounding the Palestinian territory, laying siege to it and conducting a vast ground operation.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says Israel's military response has killed more than 19,667 people, mostly women and children.

Gazans flee as army evacuation warning sparks condemnation,"Palestinians carried belongings through the rubble-strewn streets of Gaza City Friday in search of refuge as Israel's army warned residents to flee immediately before an expected ground offensive in retaliation against Hamas for the deadliest attack in Israeli history.
Hamas fighters broke through the militarised border barrier around the Gaza Strip enclave last Saturday, killing more than 1,300 people in Israel, in an attack compared to 9/11 in the United States.
There have been protests in support of the Palestinians across the Middle East and beyond, plus threats of a further confrontation between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon.
At least five Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire across the occupied West Bank during rallies in solidarity with Gaza, the health ministry said.
In Gaza, United Nations officials said the Israeli military told them the evacuation should be carried out ""within the next 24 hours"" but the army did not confirm that timeline.
Israel has retaliated to Hamas's attacks by hitting targets in Gaza with thousands of munitions. The strikes have claimed more than 1,530 lives -- 500 of them children, according to the health ministry in Gaza, where the health system is ""at a breaking point,"" the World Health Organization said.
""One million people no food no water, and still they are bombing them as they leave. Where are we going to put them?"" Elizabeth El-Nakla, the mother-in-law of Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf, said in a video he posted.""May God help us.""
The UN said the ""impossible"" mass relocation would affect 1.1 million or about half the entire population of the Gaza Strip, and urgently appealed for the order to be rescinded.
- Hostages -
Any Israeli ground operation is complicated by Hamas's holding -- according to Israel's government -- an estimated 150 Israeli, foreign and dual-national hostages who were taken back to Gaza during the attack.Hamas on Friday said 13 hostages, including foreigners, had been killed in Israeli strikes. The militants, listed as a terrorist organisation by the United States and Europe, had previously reported four hostages killed in strikes.
AFP correspondents in Gaza said the Israeli military on Friday dropped flyers on Gaza warning residents to flee ""immediately"" south of Wadi Gaza, with a map pointing south across a line in the centre of the 40 kilometre-long (25 miles) territory.
""The IDF will continue to operate significantly in Gaza City and make extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians,"" the army said earlier. 
""Hamas terrorists are hiding in Gaza City inside tunnels underneath houses and inside buildings populated with innocent civilians.""
AFP correspondents said there were ""heavy strikes"" in the northern Gaza Strip on Friday morning, including Al-Shati refugee camp and Gaza City, primarily targeting residential buildings.
The Hamas media office reported Israeli air raids on Khan Yunis and Rafah in the south.
Israel's army said its ""fighter jets struck 750 military targets in the northern Gaza Strip overnight"" including ""residences of senior terrorist operatives used as military command centres"".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas ""will be crushed."" The militants, who want Israel's destruction, said Saturday's attack sought to end Israel's ""rampaging without being held accountable"".
Hamas, in a statement, said ""our Palestinian people"" rejected Israel's Gaza evacuation order.
- A 'crime' -
Carrying plastic bags of belongings, with suitcases on their shoulders and children in their arms, Gazans were, however, moving to other areas of the crowded territory in search of safety on Friday.Some walked while others drove, with belongings strapped to the roofs of their vehicles.
More than 423,000 people have already fled their homes in the territory of 2.4 million, according to the UN.
Such an evacuation order could transform ""what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation,"" a UN spokesman said. 
The territory was already under a land, air and sea blockade since 2006.
Israel has now cut off water, food and power supplies to Gaza in a total siege it has vowed will not end until all hostages are freed.
""I condemn this siege because you have to, when they ask so many people to leave, when they don't have access to food and medicine,"" said Norway's Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt.
Arab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit said Israel's evacuation order is a ""forced transfer"" that constitutes ""a crime"".
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas meanwhile said it will be ""tantamount to a second Nakba"" or ""catastrophe"", referring to the 760,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 war that coincided with Israel's creation.
Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters: ""We are trying to provide the time and we are doing a lot of effort, and we understand it won't take 24 hours.""
Gaza's 2.4 million residents are enduring the fifth war in 15 years.
Israeli fighter jets and drones have levelled entire blocks and destroyed thousands of buildings.Hamas has threatened to kill captives if Israel bombs Gaza civilian targets without advance warning.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Jordan Friday, where he discussed with King Abdullah II ""ways to address the humanitarian needs of civilians in Gaza while Israel conducts legitimate security operations"", State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. 
King Abdullah called for ""opening humanitarian corridors to allow for the entry of urgent medical and relief aid to Gaza"", a royal court statement said.The top US diplomat, on a regional tour, arrived from Israel which he visited Thursday in a sign of solidarity. 
Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza, said in a statement posted on Telegram that ""hospitals are starting to lose capacity"" in a worsening situation with medicine and fuel running out.
- Military build-up -
Israel has called up 300,000 reservists and moved forces, tanks and armour to the southern desert area around Gaza.On Friday an AFP correspondent near Sderot, just outside Gaza, saw a convoy of more than 20 Israeli tanks and a dozen armoured vehicles heading toward Gaza.
In fields along the border with the territory, artillery fires like clockwork with a deafening noise every 30 seconds towards barely visible targets in Gaza, shaking the earth.
Since Saturday Israeli soldiers have swept the southern towns and kibbutz communities and said they found the bodies of 1,500 militants, while making ever more shocking discoveries of large numbers of dead civilians.
Yossi Landau, who has 33 years' volunteer experience with Zaka, which recovers the bodies of people who suffered unnatural deaths, says he has almost reached breaking point recovering the remains of those killed by Gaza militants.
In Beeri, a community just north of Gaza, he recalled finding a dead woman with her stomach ""ripped open, a baby was there, still connected with the cord, and stabbed"".They were among more than 100 people killed in Beeri, while around 270 were gunned down or burned in their cars at the nearby Supernova music festival.
Hamas denied its fighters killed infants during the attack on Saturday.
- Hezbollah threat -
Israel's war now flaring in the south is further complicated by a threat from the Iran-backed Hezbollah group based to the north in Lebanon.The army and Hezbollah have exchanged cross-border fire in recent days.
A Hezbollah official said on Friday his movement was ""fully prepared"" to join Hamas in the war against Israel when the time is right.
The US has sent additional munitions to Israel and deployed an aircraft carrier battle group to the eastern Mediterranean in a show of support, while warning Israel's other enemies not to enter the war.
On Friday Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, also on a solidarity visit to Israel, said Hamas fighters took ""evil to another level"" from Islamic State jihadists. 
He pledged ""iron-clad"" backing for Israel in its war.
In London, the UK said it was sending two Royal Navy ships and surveillance aircraft to the eastern Mediterranean to support Israel and ""ensure regional stability"".
Israel's arch foe Iran has long financially and militarily backed Hamas and praised its attack, but insists it was not involved.The Washington Post reported that US and Qatari officials have agreed to prevent Iran from using a $6 billion humanitarian assistance fund, following the Hamas attack.
But an Iranian official said the US ""can NOT renege on the agreement."" 
Thousands of Iranians, Iraqis and Jordanians took to the streets on Friday in a sign of support for the Palestinians.
Pro-Palestinian rallies also occurred in Asia, including in Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, New Delhi and Dhaka.

Fresh Gaza strikes as fears grow for patients in raided hospital,"Israel said it had taken 100 people into custody at one of Gaza's main hospitals Saturday after troops raided the facility, with fears mounting for patients and staff trapped inside.
The deadly bombardment of Gaza continued overnight with another 100 people killed in Israeli strikes, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
At least 120 patients and five medical teams are stuck without water, food and electricity in the Nasser hospital in Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis, according to the health ministry.Israel has for weeks concentrated its military operations in Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas's Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, the alleged architect of the October 7 attack that triggered the war.
Intense fighting has raged around the Nasser hospital -- one of the Palestinian territory's last major medical facilities that remains even partly operational.
The power was cut and the generators stopped after the raid, leading to the deaths of six patients due to a lack of oxygen, according to Gaza's health ministry.
""New-born children are at a risk of dying in the next few hours,"" the ministry warned Saturday.Israel's army said troops entered the hospital on Thursday, acting on what it said was ""credible intelligence"" that hostages seized in the October 7 attack had been held there and that the bodies of some may still be inside.
It said it has detained 100 people from the hospital suspected of ""terrorist activity"", seized weapons and retrieved ""medications with the names of Israeli hostages"" in the hospital.
But the raid has been criticised by medics and the United Nations. The army has insisted it made every effort to keep the hospital supplied with power, including bringing in an alternative generator.
A witness, who declined to be named for safety reasons, told AFP the Israeli forces had shot ""at anyone who moved inside the hospital"".
- 'Pattern of attacks' -
World Health Organization spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic slammed the operation Friday, saying ""more degradation to the hospital means more lives being lost"".
""Patients, health workers, and civilians who are seeking refuge in hospitals deserve safety and not a burial in those places of healing,"" he said.
Doctors Without Borders said its medics had been forced to flee and leave patients behind, with one employee unaccounted for and another detained by Israeli forces.The Gaza war began with Hamas' October 7 attack which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Militants also took about 250 people hostage, 130 of whom are still in Gaza, including 30 who are presumed dead, according to Israeli figures.
Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed at least 28,858 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.
Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals for military purposes, which the Palestinian Islamist group has denied.
The UN Human Rights Office said the Nasser hospital raid appeared to be ""part of a pattern of attacks by Israeli forces striking essential life-saving civilian infrastructure"".
- 'Die from hunger' -
High-level negotiations to pause the war were held this week in Cairo, but their outcome is still unclear.A day after US President Joe Biden called for a ""temporary truce"" to secure the release of hostages, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh on Saturday reiterated the group's demands, including a complete pause in fighting, the release of Hamas prisoners, and withdrawal of Israeli troops.
Qatar-based Haniyeh said Hamas would ""not agree to anything less"".
Biden has also urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to launch an offensive in Rafah without a plan to keep civilians safe -- but Netanyahu insisted he would push ahead with a ""powerful"" operation there to defeat Hamas.
Around 1.4 million displaced civilians are trapped in Rafah after taking refuge in a makeshift encampment by the Egyptian border, with dwindling supplies.
""We are dying slowly due to the scarcity of resources and the lack of medications and treatments,"" said displaced Palestinian Mohammad Yaghi.In northern Gaza, many are so desperate for food they are grinding up animal feed.
""We need food now,"" said Mohammed Nassar, 50, from Jabalia in northern Gaza.
""We're going to die from hunger, not by bombs or missiles.""
With the UN warning that Gazans are close to famine, the head of its agency for Palestinian refugees accused Israel of waging a campaign to ""destroy"" it entirely.
Israel has called for UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini to resign following claims a Hamas tunnel was discovered under its Gaza City headquarters.
Lazzarini told Swiss media Tamedia that the tunnel was 20 metres underground, and UNRWA didn't have the capabilities to search below ground in Gaza. More than 150 UNRWA installations have been hit during the war, he said.
- Regional tensions -
Hamas's armed wing has warned hostages in Gaza are also ""struggling to stay alive"" as conditions deteriorate due to relentless Israeli bombardments.
The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Egypt was building a walled camp near the border to accommodate Palestinians displaced from Gaza, citing Egyptian officials and security analysts.
Satellite images obtained by AFP show machinery building a wall along the highly secure frontier.With the conflict now in its fifth month, regional tensions remain high.
Hamas ally Hezbollah and arch-foe Israel have been exchanging near-daily border fire since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.
The leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, Hassan Nasrallah, vowed that Israel would pay ""with blood"" for civilians it has killed in Lebanon.

Gaza fishermen rejoice at finally fixing their boats,"GAZA - Wearing sky blue overalls near Gaza's port, technician Mohammed Jerboa celebrates the chance to finally repair fishing boats after a 15-year Israeli ban on vital materials. 
It's a ""great achievement"", he said after sanding down the faded paint as part of a team of workers patching up rickety boats with sheets of newly imported fibreglass.
The material has been prohibited from entering the Palestinian enclave since 2007, as one of scores of items Israel deems could be used for military purposes by Gaza militants.
The measures have left fishermen struggling for years to pursue their livelihood due to the state of the boats -- until the United Nations brokered a deal that allows fibreglass to reach a supervised workshop.
""I started working at this workshop two weeks ago... for the fishermen and for us as technicians, this provided a job opportunity,"" said Jerboa.Gaza has one of the world's highest unemployment rates at nearly 50 percent, according to World Bank data.
Dust flies as the team gets to work, within view of a security camera, while the smell of fresh paint drifts across the fenced yard from a recently refurbished boat.
Rows of unseaworthy vessels rest in the sand nearby, with rusty parts and covered in scratches, laying bare the scale of the task at hand.
Manal al-Najjar, a coordination officer at the United Nations Office for Project Services -- which handles infrastructure projects -- said there are still some 300 boats to be fixed.
After months of negotiations with Palestinian and Israeli officials, the UN reached a deal which allows enough fibreglass for 10 boats to enter Gaza at a time.
""The repair process takes two weeks to a month for every 10 boats,"" Najjar said.
With the first repaired boats hitting the water, she added that fishermen so far are happy with the project as ""the price is very reasonable and the quality of the materials is high"".
- 'Suffocated' by restrictions -Standing near piles of nets at the port, fisherman Saleem al-Assi was one of the first to be selected for the project and agreed the costs were low.
""I've had boats out of action for eight years and they need a lot of fibreglass,"" said Assi, who has around 50 relatives working in the fishing trade.
""Hundreds of fishermen applied to the project, but the project can't cover everyone,"" he added.
In addition to the difficulty to obtain materials, the fishing industry has been hit by restrictions at sea. 
As part of Israel's blockade on Gaza, imposed in 2007 after the Palestinian militant group Hamas took power, the navy enforces a fishing zone that limits the catch.
Israel has fought four wars with Palestinian militants over the past 14 years, as well as a three-day conflict in August which left 49 Gazans dead.At the port, Assi welcomed the fibreglass project but lamented that he still cannot get his family's nine boats out to sea.
""We only have two motors. Motors are non-existent,"" he said.
Najjar acknowledged the shortage and said the UN plans to import motors as part of its project.
Standing beside the calm Mediterranean waters, Assi said the lack of equipment due to Israeli restrictions has ""suffocated us"".
""I don't know why Israel is blocking their entry. Will rockets be fired from boats?""",Monday 05 December 2022 - 11:00am
Israel says troops encircle Gaza City,"RAFAH - Israeli ground troops encircled Hamas stronghold Gaza City on Friday, after close ally the United States urged ""concrete steps"" to minimise civilian casualties.
Ahead of top US diplomat Antony Blinken's scheduled visit to Israel Friday, the country's military said it had ""completed the encirclement"" of Gaza's largest city -- signalling a new phase in the month-long war against Hamas.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also on Thursday hailed victories so far, telling a group of elite soldiers that Israeli forces were ""advancing"" despite ""painful losses"".
""We are in the midst of the campaign. We have very impressive successes"" he said at a base near Tel Aviv.
""We are already more than on the outskirts of Gaza City. We are advancing.""
Israel's military describes Gaza City as ""the centre of the Hamas terror organisation"". But it is also home to some half a million Palestinians who have endured weeks of withering aerial bombardments, dwindling supplies and daily carnage.
Outside Gaza City's Al-Quds hospital, displaced residents seeking shelter from Israeli strikes told AFP that civilians would not withstand the barrage much longer.
""This is not a life. We need a safe place for our kids,"" said 50-year-old Hiyam Shamlakh. ""Everybody is terrified, children, women and the elderly.""
But yet more carnage seems to lay ahead, as the conflict turns to urban and underground warfare -- with Hamas fighting from a tunnel complex believed to span hundreds of kilometres (miles).
A new video posted by Hamas sought to illustrate the devastating impact of its underground network, with a gunman seemingly emerging from a tunnel to plant an explosive on a nearby and unsuspecting Israeli tank.
The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, insisted invading Israeli soldiers would go home ""in black bags"".
""Gaza will be the curse of history for Israel,"" spokesman Abu Obeida said.
 
- Minimise harm -
 
It has now been almost one month since Hamas' bloody raids into Israel killed an estimated 1,400 people. 
Israel's allies have backed its right to self-defence, but there is growing global concern and anger at how Israel has chosen to prosecute the war.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 9,000 people have died in Israeli bombardments, mostly women and children. Departing the United States, Blinken signalled he would press Israel to better protect civilians.
""We will be talking about concrete steps that can and should be taken to minimise harm to men, women and children in Gaza,"" he told reporters.
But both Israel and the United States have ruled out a blanket ceasefire, which they say would allow Hamas to regroup and resupply.US President Joe Biden has backed ""temporary, localised"" pauses in fighting to allow humanitarian work to be done.
""We've seen in recent days Palestinian civilians continuing to bear the brunt"" Blinken said, an apparent reference to repeated Israeli strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp north of Gaza City.
Gaza's Hamas-ruled government said 195 were killed in those strikes, with hundreds more missing and wounded, figures AFP could not independently verify.
AFP witnessed rescuers at the camp desperately clawing through the rubble and twisted metal in a frantic search for survivors.Countries around the world recalled their ambassadors from Israel in protest at the strikes. Bolivia severed diplomatic ties.
United Nations rights monitors warned such bombings of densely populated residential areas ""could amount to war crimes.""
Israel has sought to show Jabalia was a legitimate target, saying it killed a senior Hamas commander in a tunnel complex below the camp.
Major strikes also hit Gaza's Bureij refugee camp and an area near a UN-run school in Jabalia Thursday, where the health ministry said 27 had died.
 
- Escape to safety -
 On Thursday some 400 more foreigners and dual nationals managed to escape the war to Egypt, along with 60 wounded Palestinians.
Egypt said it eventually plans to help evacuate 7,000 foreigners through Rafah.
A source at the Rafah border crossing told AFP it will open again on Friday.
Meanwhile, in Israel's north, Lebanon's Hezbollah said it attacked 19 Israeli positions along the border simultaneously.
Some 71 people have been killed in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began, according to an AFP tally.Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah is on Friday expected to break weeks of silence and deliver a speech that could have a profound impact on the region.
Some analysts believe that Hezbollah has little interest in becoming fully embroiled in a conflict that Israeli officials have threatened could destroy Lebanon.
Others say the decision lies with Iran, which leads the regional ""axis of resistance"" against Israel -- backing Hamas, Hezbollah and rollcall of armed groups from Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Gaza archaeologists find 'complete' Roman-era cemetery,"GAZA CITY - Researchers in the northern Gaza Strip have unearthed dozens of Roman-era tombs at a site discovered earlier this year during construction work.
Construction workers had uncovered 31 tombs near the town of Beit Lahia as work began in early 2022 on an Egyptian-funded residential project, part of reconstruction efforts after the 11-day war in May 2021 between Israel and armed groups in blockaded Gaza.
The project has been partially suspended following the discovery, and a team from the local antiquities ministry visited the site to catalogue the findings and look for more, Fazl al-Atal, head of the excavation team, told AFP on Monday.
""So far, 51 Roman tombs dating from the first century AD have been found,"" including the 31 initially found by the construction workers, he said.
""We expect to find 75 to 80 tombs in total,"" Atal added, hailing the discovery of the ""first complete Roman-era cemetery found in Gaza"".
The 2,000-year-old burial site is located near the ruins of the Greek port of Anthedon, on the road leading to ancient Ascalon -- now the Israeli city of Ashkelon by the Gaza border.
The antiquity ministry team has been focusing on ""documentation, research and protection of the site,"" Atal said. ""Our aim is to ascertain... the causes of death.""
Jamal Abu Reda, in charge of antiquities at the ministry, said the site is ""of great importance and believed to be an extension of the site"" of ancient Anthedon.

UN chief calls UNRWA 'backbone' of Gaza humanitarian aid,"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called his organization's Palestinian refugee agency the ""backbone"" of Gaza aid on Wednesday after several countries suspended funding over Israeli claims 12 UNRWA staffers participated in Hamas' October 7 attacks.
""Yesterday, I met with donors to listen to their concerns and to outline the steps we are taking to address them... UNRWA is the backbone of all humanitarian response in Gaza,"" Guterres told a UN committee on Palestinian rights.
Withholding UNRWA funding was ""perilous and would result in the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza,"" the heads of the UN agencies said in a joint statement Tuesday.
The dispute intensified earlier Tuesday after Israel accused UNRWA of allowing Hamas to use agency infrastructure in Gaza for military activity.
UNRWA said it has acted promptly over allegations by Israel that 12 of its staff were involved in the Hamas attacks. Washington, Britain, Germany and Japan are among countries to have suspended payments in light of those disclosures.
The UN agency has long been under scrutiny by Israel, which accuses it of systematically going against the country's interests.
Israel has vowed to stop the agency's work in Gaza after the war and doubled down on Tuesday when government spokesman Eylon Levy said UNRWA ""has been fundamentally compromised."" 
He accused it of ""hiring terrorists on a massive scale, letting its infrastructure be used for Hamas military activity and relying on Hamas for aid distribution in the Gaza Strip.""
 
- UNRWA 'beating heart' of Gaza aid -
 
The UN's humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said the entire humanitarian system -- with UNRWA at its center -- was committed to delivering aid to Gaza.
""The breadth of the humanitarian community –- including UN agencies, NGOs, the Red Cross and the Red Crescent -- is collaborating to ensure that aid reaches people in need to the greatest extent possible,"" he told the UN Security Council.
""You will not be surprised to hear that at the beating heart of this is UNRWA.
""Our humanitarian response for the occupied Palestinian territories is dependent on UNRWA being adequately funded and operational.
""Of course we would like to see decisions to withhold funds from UNRWA revoked.""
UN Gaza aid coordinator Sigrid Kaag said earlier Tuesday ""there is no way that any organization can replace or substitute (the) tremendous capacity... of UNRWA.""
Following the October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, its military launched a withering air, land and sea offensive.

Israel to 'extend' Gaza ground operation as UN warns of 'avalanche of human suffering',"GAZA - Israel pounded northern Gaza and said it was ""extending"" its ground operation late Friday amid UN warnings of an ""avalanche of human suffering"" in the battered Palestinian territory.
""Following the series of strikes of the last days, the ground forces are extending the ground operation tonight,"" military spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters.
His announcement followed two straight nights of tank incursions into Gaza.
Earlier, the military said it had increased its strikes ""in a very significant way"", as AFP live footage captured intense bombardment of northern Gaza.
The armed wing of the Islamist group Hamas said it responded with ""salvos"" of rockets aimed at Israel.
Hamas said all internet connections and communications across the territory had been cut, and accused Israel of taking the measure ""to perpetrate massacres with bloody retaliatory strikes from the air, land and sea"".
Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping over 220 others, according to Israeli officials.
""Salvos of rockets in the direction of the occupied territories (Israel) in answer to the massacre of civilians,"" Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on its Telegram channel.
The Hamas-run health ministry said Friday Israeli strikes on Gaza had now killed 7,326 people, mainly civilians and many of them children.UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that Gaza faces ""an unprecedented avalanche of human suffering"" because of the lack of food, water and power during Israeli bombing in response to the October 7 attack.
""I repeat my call for a humanitarian ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and the delivery of life-saving supplies,"" Guterres said in a statement.
""Misery is growing by the minute. Without a fundamental change, the people of Gaza will face an unprecedented avalanche of human suffering.""
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees had earlier warned that ""many more will die"" in Gaza from catastrophic shortages after nearly three weeks of bombardment by Israel.
The UN human rights office also raised the alarm over ""war crimes"" being committed as the Israel-Hamas conflict raged into its 21st day.
Concern is growing about regional fallout from the conflict, with the United States warning Iran against escalation while striking facilities in Syria it says were used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and others.
Israel's military on Friday accused Hamas of using hospitals in Gaza as operations centres for directing attacks.
""Hamas wages war from hospitals,"" in the territory, military spokesman Daniel Hagari said, and alleged the group was also using fuel stored in these facilities for its operations.
The allegation was swiftly denied by a senior Hamas official who said it had ""no basis in truth"".
 
Israel has cut supplies of food, water and power to Gaza, notably blocking all deliveries of fuel saying it would be exploited by Hamas to manufacture weapons and explosives.""People in Gaza are dying, they are not only dying from bombs and strikes, soon many more will die from the consequences of (the) siege,"" said UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini.
""Basic services are crumbling, medicine is running out, food and water are running out, the streets of Gaza have started overflowing with sewage,"" he said of the densely populated territory where 45 percent of housing is reported to have been damaged or destroyed.
In Geneva, the UN human rights office raised the alarm over war crimes, saying ""the atrocious attacks by Hamas... amounted to war crimes"" but also pointing to Israel's Gaza bombardment.
""Nowhere is safe in Gaza. Compelling people to evacuate in these circumstances... and while under a complete siege raises serious concerns over forcible transfer, which is a war crime,"" spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said of Israel's order for northern Gaza residents to flee south.
 
- 'Nothing more than crumbs' -
 
A first tranche of critically needed aid was allowed in at the weekend, but since then only 74 trucks have crossed. Before the conflict, the UN says an average of 500 trucks were entering Gaza every day.""These few trucks are nothing more than crumbs that will not make a difference,"" Lazzarini said, insisting Gaza needed a ""meaningful and uninterrupted aid flow"" and a ""humanitarian ceasefire to ensure this aid reaches those in need"".
His words echoed a call from EU leaders on Thursday for ""continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid"".
A first team of six medics from the International Committee of the Red Cross entered Gaza Friday via its Rafah crossing with Egypt, along with six aid trucks, the ICRC said.
Between the bombardments and the fuel shortages, 12 of Gaza's 35 hospitals have been forced to close, and UNRWA said it has had to ""significantly reduce its operations"".
With tens of thousands of Israeli troops massed along the Gaza border ahead of a widely expected ground offensive, the army said it had staged another brief ground incursion into Gaza, the second in as many days.
""We carried out a ground operation in central Gaza... as part of preparations for the coming stages of the war,"" the army's Hagari said. The first incursion had targeted northern Gaza.
Hamas said Israel had tried to stage ""a large-scale amphibious operation on Rafah's coast"" in southern Gaza at dawn but it had been thwarted, and the soldiers had ""fled by sea, leaving behind a quantity of weapons"".
Israel confirmed the operation, saying troops had struck ""Hamas military infrastructure and... a compound"" used by Hamas militants.
 
- 'Wherever we go, we will die' -
 
The army also updated to 229 the number of hostages held by Hamas, many of whom hold foreign passports, with their families frantic about their fate.""I have never felt such a feeling of helplessness,"" said 23-year-old Ella Ben Ami whose parents were kidnapped. With recurring nightmares every single night, she says she feels ""like the living dead"".
Militants also fired rockets on Friday towards Tel Aviv. One struck the city, wounding three people, one moderately and two lightly, medics said.
Violence has also risen sharply in the occupied West Bank since the October 7 attacks, with more than 100 Palestinians killed and over 1,900 wounded.
Another four Palestinians were killed Friday during Israeli raids in the northern cities of Jenin and Qalqilya, the health ministry said.

"Gaza health ministry says war deaths near 30,000 as famine looms"," 
JERUSALEM - Children have died of malnutrition in a Gaza hospital, the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry said, as its overall toll for Palestinians killed in the almost five-month war neared 30,000.
While mediators say a truce deal between Israel and Hamas could be just days away, aid agencies have sounded the alarm about the dire humanitarian conditions and warned of a looming famine in Gaza's north.
Two children died of ""dehydration and malnutrition"" at Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital, said health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra, calling for ""immediate action"" from international institutions to prevent more of such deaths.
""The famine death toll among children rose to six martyrs,"" at least five of them in the besieged territory's north in recent days, he said. AFP was unable to independently verify the deaths.
Citing the deteriorating conditions in Gaza, USAID head Samantha Power said Israel needed to open more crossings so that ""vitally needed humanitarian assistance can be dramatically surged"".
""This is a matter of life and death,"" Power said in a video posted on social media platform X.
Mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been seeking a six-week pause in the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which in response vowed to eliminate the Palestinian Islamist group that rules in Gaza.Negotiators are hoping a truce can begin by the start of Ramadan, the holy Muslim month that kicks off March 10 or 11, depending on the lunar calendar. 
The proposals reportedly include the release of some Israeli hostages held in Gaza in exchange for several hundred Palestinian detainees held by Israel.
Short of the complete withdrawal Hamas has called for, a source from the group said the deal might see Israeli forces leave ""cities and populated areas"", allowing the return of some displaced Palestinians and humanitarian relief.
US President Joe Biden is ""pushing all of us to try to get this agreement over the finish line"", said his secretary of state, Antony Blinken.
 
- Famine 'imminent' -
 
The crucial southern Gaza city of Rafah is the main entry point for aid crossing the border from neighbouring Egypt.But the World Food Programme said no humanitarian group had been able to deliver aid to the north for more than a month, accusing Israel of blocking access. 
Neighbouring Jordan has coordinated efforts to air-drop supplies over southern Gaza.
""If nothing changes, a famine is imminent in northern Gaza,"" the World Food Programme's deputy executive director Carl Skau said.
Israeli officials have denied blocking supplies, and the army on Wednesday said ""50 trucks carrying humanitarian aid"" had made it to northern Gaza in recent days. 
The war was triggered by an unprecedented Hamas attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of around 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
Militants also took about 250 hostages, 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 31 presumed dead, according to Israel.Hundreds of thousands of Gazans have been displaced, with nearly 1.5 million people now packed in Rafah.
In a sign of growing desperation among Gazans over living conditions, a rare protest was held Wednesday by residents over the soaring prices of commodities. ""Everyone is suffering inside these tents,"" said Amal Zaghbar, who was displaced and sheltering in a makeshift camp. 
""We're dying slowly.""
Israel has repeatedly threatened a ground offensive on Rafah, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying a truce would only delay it, as such an operation was needed for ""total victory"" over Hamas. 
Egypt -- which borders Rafah -- says an assault on the overcrowded city would have ""catastrophic repercussions"". 
 
- No one 'left behind' -
 
While Israel's plans for post-war Gaza exclude any mention of the Palestinian Authority, its top ally the United States and other powers have called for a revitalised PA, which governs the occupied West Bank, to take charge of the territory.Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki said a ""technocratic"" government without Gaza's rulers Hamas was needed to ""stop this insane war"" and facilitate relief operations and reconstruction.
His government, based in the West Bank, resigned this week, with prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh citing the need for change after the war ends.
A government that includes Hamas -- longtime rivals of president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party, which controls the PA -- would ""be boycotted by a number of countries"", Maliki told a news conference in Geneva.
On Thursday, Palestinian factions -- including Hamas and Fatah -- were expected to arrive in Moscow for a meeting at Russia's invitation.In Israel, Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure to bring the hostages home.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant insisted the government was ""making every effort"".
A group of 150 Israelis started a four-day march from Reim, near the Gaza border, to Jerusalem, calling for the government to reach a deal.
""No one should be left behind,"" said Ronen Neutra, father of captive Omer Neutra, an Israeli soldier who is also a US citizen.
By Adel Zaanoun With Robbie Corey-boulet In Jerusalem",Thursday 29 February 2024 - 06:48am
Gaza war heaps pressure on Palestinian president Abbas,"GAZA - The widely unpopular Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas is facing growing anger on the streets of the occupied West Bank as Israel wages its war against Hamas in Gaza.
The 88-year-old leader is seen as out of touch with the increasing desperation of the Palestinian people and Israel's furious response to the October 7 attacks by Hamas has only exacerbated their discontent.
After a rocket strike on a Gaza hospital this week caused fresh outrage, hundreds of Palestinians took to the streets in a rare demonstration shouting ""Abbas step down!"" before being dispersed by security forces.
Abbas has led the Palestinian Authority (PA) for 18 years but has only limited authority over the West Bank and none over Gaza where the authority was violently ousted by Hamas in 2007.
On the world stage, Abbas has clung to the unrealised promises of the 1993 Oslo Accords.
The PA was meant to be a first step toward an independent Palestinian state, but negotiations have been at a standstill for more than a decade.
Abbas has been powerless against the rapid expansion of Israeli settlements and military control in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, both occupied since 1967, fragmenting what was meant to be a contiguous Palestinian territory.
Violence against Palestinian civilians by Israeli settlers and clashes between the Israeli army and Palestinian armed groups have increased.
Conditions have only worsened after the formation of Israel's most far-right government in history in December, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 
- Sidelined president -
 
""Abbas bet on the international community, believing that it would force Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories to give the Palestinians a state,"" said Ubai Al-Aboudi, director of the Bisan Center for Research and Development, a think-tank based in Ramallah.
""However, the international community has shown that it cares little about the blood shed by the Palestinians and their suffering, hence the popular anger,"" Aboudi told AFP.
Abbas has remained on the sidelines since the surprise Hamas assault, which left 1,400 dead -- mainly civilians, according to Israeli officials -- in the worst attack suffered by Israel since its independence in 1948.
Intensive retaliatory air strikes and artillery barrages have left at least 4,651 people dead in Gaza, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry.
The bombardment has caused outrage across the Arab world.
Many Palestinians, regardless of their politics, have expressed support for Hamas on social media.
Abbas set off anger this week with a comment reported by the official Palestinian news agency that ""the policies and actions of Hamas do not represent the Palestinian people"". The statement was withdrawn.
The next day a rocket struck Gaza's Al-Ahli hospital, leaving dozens, perhaps hundreds dead. There were demonstrations across the West Bank after Hamas blamed Israel. Israel insisted the explosion was caused by a failed rocket fired by Islamic Jihad militants.
Even before the latest war, Abbas was deeply unpopular, while support for peaceful negotiations was waning.
Seventy-eight percent of Palestinians wanted Abbas to resign, according to a poll published in September by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research.
Some 58 percent said they supported ""armed struggle"" to end the Israeli occupation, compared with 20 percent in favour of a negotiated settlement and 24 percent for ""peaceful resistance"".
Abbas opponents feel ""the Palestinian Authority is increasingly assimilated, either by inaction or by security cooperation, to Israel's policy"", said Xavier Guignard, a political scientist specialising in the Palestinian territories.
There was a real feeling that ""Abbas was unable to react to what was happening in Gaza"", said Guignard, of the Paris-based Noria Research.
Hugh Lovatt, an analyst for the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that ""as the Palestinian public mood hardens further in support of armed resistance, the PA risks being swept away"" if it continues to ignore public opinion.
Abbas would be further weakened, he said, as ""the US and Israel push the PA to crack down harder on Hamas and other armed groups in the West Bank -– which would further erode its public standing"".
Omar Khatib, who took part in a Ramallah demonstration on Friday in support of Gaza Palestinians, gave a withering assessment of the Palestinian Authority.
""The resistance is confronting Israel in Gaza, and we are confronting the Authority here because it is just a tool in the hands of the occupation to repress us in the West Bank,"" he said.

Middle East conflict | Gift of the Givers refers Israel to ICC,"JOHANNESBURG - Gift of the Givers wants the Israeli government charged for genocide and gross human rights violations in Gaza.
It's joining hundreds of organisations and lawyers to lay a complaint at the International Criminal Court. 
The humanitarian group's Gaza head, Ahmed Abbasi, was killed while returning from morning prayers last month. ",Tuesday 05 December 2023 - 07:40am
Israel sets Ramadan deadline for assault on Gazan city Rafah,"JERUSALEM - Israel has threatened to invade Gaza's Rafah by the start of Ramadan if Hamas does not return the remaining hostages by then, despite international pressure to protect Palestinian civilians sheltering in the southern city.
With prospects for truce talks dimmed, the United States and other governments, as well as the United Nations, have issued increasingly urgent appeals to Israel to call off its planned offensive on Rafah.
The Israeli government says the city on the Egypt border is the last remaining stronghold in Gaza of the Palestinian militant group Hamas.
But it is also where three-quarters of the displaced Palestinian population has fled, taking shelter in sprawling tent encampments without access to adequate food, water or medicine.
""The world must know, and Hamas leaders must know —- if by Ramadan our hostages are not home, the fighting will continue everywhere, including the Rafah area,"" Benny Gantz, a retired military chief of staff, told a conference of American Jewish leaders in Jerusalem on Sunday.""Hamas has a choice. They can surrender, release the hostages and the civilians of Gaza can celebrate the feast of Ramadan,"" added Gantz, a member of the three-person war cabinet.
Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, is expected to begin around March 10.
Gantz said the offensive will be carried out in coordination with American and Egyptian partners to ""minimise the civilian casualties as much as possible"".
But where Palestinians can go after four months of war have flattened vast swathes of the Strip remains unclear.
""There's no safe place. Even the hospital is not safe,"" Ahmad Mohammed Aburizq told AFP from the morgue of a Rafah hospital where mourners gathered around a loved one wrapped in a white body bag.
""That's my cousin -- he was martyred in Al-Mawasi, in the 'safe area'. And my mother was martyred the day before.""
 
- 'Total victory' -
 
For weeks, international mediators have sought to broker a truce-for-hostages deal that would pause fighting for six weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has played down the possibility of an impending breakthrough, calling Hamas's demands ""delusional"".Even if a deal is struck, he insists the campaign to eliminate Hamas from Gaza will not be completed until clearing Rafah. 
""Deal or no deal, we have to finish the job to get total victory,"" he said at the Jerusalem conference on Sunday.
With international pressure piling on Israel, the UN's top court will open a week of hearings from Monday examining the legal consequences of the country's 57-year occupation of Palestinian territories.
The hearings, requested by the UN General Assembly, are separate from South Africa's high-profile case alleging Israel is committing genocide in its current Gaza offensive.
At the UN's Security Council, the United States signalled it would veto the latest UN draft resolution seeking an immediate ceasefire should it come to a vote this week. 
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the resolution would jeopardise the ongoing truce talks, as well as the broader aim of ""an enduring resolution of hostilities"".Western governments have increasingly pushed for unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state to be part of that wider peace process, but Israel's government on Sunday unanimously adopted a declaration rejecting such recognition.
""After the terrible massacre of October 7, there can be no greater reward for terrorism than that and it will prevent any future peace settlement,"" Netanyahu said.
Hamas has meanwhile threatened to suspend its involvement in any ceasefire negotiations unless relief supplies reach Gaza's north, where aid agencies have warned of looming famine.
 
- 'Crying from hunger' -
 
On Sunday morning, dozens of Israelis blocked Gaza-bound aid trucks from entering through the Nitzana crossing with Egypt, AFP reporters and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said.Gazans say they are going so hungry they are grinding animal feed into flour.
""My children are starving, they wake up crying from hunger. Where do I get food for them?"" a northern Gazan woman told AFP.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said nearly three in four people are drinking contaminated water.
""The speed of deterioration in Gaza is unprecedented,"" it said.
After a week-long siege, the largest hospital still functional in Gaza is no longer operational, according to the World Health Organization.
At least 20 of the 200 patients still at the Nasser Hospital urgently require relocation to other facilities, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, adding that his organisation ""was not permitted to enter"" the site.
Seven patients, including a child, have died there since Friday due to power cuts, and ""70 medical staff including intensive care doctors"" have been arrested, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said diesel and oxygen supplies had been delivered on Saturday and a temporary generator was running.
Israeli troops in Khan Yunis were still operating around the hospital on Sunday after the military said it had ""located additional weapons"".
Israel has concentrated its military operations in Khan Yunis, just a few kilometres from Rafah and the hometown of Hamas's Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, who is accused of orchestrating the October 7 attack.
The Hamas assault that launched the war killed about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli figures.Israel's retaliatory campaign in Gaza has killed at least 28,985 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.

UN warns order 'starting to break down' as Israel pounds Gaza,"GAZA - Desperate Palestinians in Gaza burst into aid centres after more than three weeks of siege and bombardment, the UN said on Sunday, as Israel escalated ground operations in the Hamas-run territory.
Israel's allies France and Britain underlined the urgency of delivering aid to Gaza, a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu steeled his nation for a ""long and difficult war"".
Despite calls for a humanitarian ceasefire, international outrage and the potential risk to hostages held in Gaza, Israel has intensified the war triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack.
Hamas militants stormed across the Gaza border on October 7 in the deadliest attack in Israel's history, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping 230 others, according to Israeli officials.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says the retaliatory Israeli bombardment has killed more than 8,000 people, mainly civilians and half of them children.
Panic and fear have surged inside the Palestinian territory, where the UN says more than half of its 2.4 million residents are displaced and thousands of buildings destroyed.
UN chief Antonio Guterres said the situation was ""growing more desperate by the hour"" as casualties increase and essential supplies of food, water, medicine and shelter dwindle.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron ""stressed the importance of getting urgent humanitarian support into Gaza"" during a conversation on Sunday, the UK government said.The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said ""thousands of people"" broke into several of its warehouses and distribution centres in Gaza, grabbing basic survival items like wheat flour and hygiene supplies.
""This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down,"" it said.
 
- 'Catastrophic failing' -
 
Outside a bakery in southern Gaza's Rafah, Etidal al-Masri was queueing but did not know if she would get bread.Having been displaced from the northern Strip, Masri lamented that Gazans ""must now queue for bread, toilets and even for sleep"".
Communications were down for days after Israel cut internet lines, although connectivity was gradually returning on Sunday.
Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, voiced shock at the suffering in Gaza and urged all sides to de-escalate.
""This is a catastrophic failing that the world must not tolerate,"" she said.
A US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 40 more aid trucks may enter Gaza on Sunday and that Israel was committed to allowing 100 to arrive daily.
Israel's army said a new ""stage"" of the war started with ground incursions since late Friday, an escalation from the brief operations earlier in the week.On Sunday the military said it had struck hundreds of Hamas targets and increased its ground forces in Gaza.
In a late-night televised address on Saturday, Netanyahu announced a ""second stage of the war whose goals are clear: destroying the military and leadership capabilities of Hamas, and bringing the hostages back home"".
He vowed to ""eradicate"" Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that has governed Gaza since 2007, ""for the sake of our existence"".
 
- 'All areas are dangerous' -
 
A Gaza health ministry spokesman said ""hundreds"" were killed and wounded on Sunday in ""unprecedented"" Israeli military action.The ""burden"" lies with Israel to distinguish between Hamas militants and innocent civilians in Gaza, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN television.
President Joe Biden will call Netanyahu on Sunday to reiterate the US position, Sullivan added.
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari again urged Palestinian civilians to go south ""to a safer area where they can receive water, food and medicine"".
Israeli fighter jets again dropped leaflets over Gaza City on Saturday, warning residents that the northern area was now a ""battlefield"" and they should ""evacuate immediately"".After dozens of aid trucks entered the territory in recent days -- far below the estimated needs -- Hagari vowed humanitarian efforts would expand.
But Ibrahim Shandoughli, a 53-year-old from Jabaliya in northern Gaza, told AFP he and his family went nowhere.
""Where do you want us to evacuate to? All the areas are dangerous.""
 
- 'Bring them home' -
 
While Israel has mourned its dead, sympathy has swelled for the families whose loved ones were abducted by Hamas and are at heightened risk as the war intensifies in Gaza.""We demanded that no action be taken that endangers the fate of our family members,"" said Meirav Leshem Gonen, the mother of hostage Romi Gonen.
Dozens of Israelis rallied outside President Isaac Herzog's residence in Jerusalem on Sunday before a meeting with families of hostages.
Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it was prepared to release the hostages if Israel freed the Palestinian prisoners it was holding.Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, said the group was ready for an ""immediate"" exchange.
Ifat Kalderon, whose cousin Ofer Kalderon is believed held in Gaza along with other relatives, told AFP she supported the idea of a prisoner release in exchange for the hostages.
""Take them, we don't need them here,"" she said, referring to Palestinian detainees. 
""I want my family and all the hostages to come back home.""
 
- 'Red lines crossed' -
 
The ground operations have heightened fears that Israel's other enemies -- the Iran-allied ""axis of resistance"" forces in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen -- enter the conflict.Top ally the United States has warned Israel's enemies to stay out and strengthened its military presence in the region.
Skirmishes have intensified on the Israeli-Lebanese border with Iran-backed Hamas ally Hezbollah, raising fears of a new front.
Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi warned on X, formerly Twitter, that Israel's ""crimes have crossed the red lines, which may force everyone to take action"".

AFP calls for investigation over strike on Gaza bureau,"GAZA - AFP on Saturday called on Israel for ""an in-depth and transparent investigation"" into the exact involvement of its army after a strike severely damaged its office in Gaza City, which has been shelled for weeks.
AFP ""has taken note of the recent statements from the Israeli army spokesman concerning 'an army strike nearby (the AFP office) that might have caused debris',"" it said in a statement. 
However, ""this statement on its own does not explain the extent of the damage caused to the AFP bureau"", located on the top floors of an 11-storey building, it said of Thursday's incident.
""A strike on the offices of an international news agency sends a deeply troubling message to all the journalists working in such difficult conditions in Gaza,"" said AFP Chairman and CEO Fabrice Fries.
""It is essential that all efforts are made to protect media in Gaza,"" he added.
According to media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF), more than 30 journalists have been killed since the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas.
RSF has filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court alleging war crimes committed against Palestinian journalists in Gaza.
 
- Significant damage -
 
AFP is one of the few international media organisations to have an office in the Gaza Strip.
It employs a total of nine people there and is ""redoubling its efforts to allow employees and their families to evacuate if they wish to leave"".
AFP's live video feed broadcasting 24/7 from Gaza City has been temporarily suspended since Saturday, for reasons outside AFP's control.
An AFP employee who visited the office on Friday said an explosive projectile appeared to have entered the technician's office in the bureau horizontally from east to west.
The strike destroyed the wall opposite the window and caused significant damage to the adjacent room and other doors. It also punctured water tanks on the roof.
""According to the current information we hold, it seems that there was a IDF (Israel Defense Forces) strike near the building to eliminate an immediate threat,"" a spokesperson said in a statement Friday.
""The building was not targeted in any way by the IDF and... we do not have any record of a missed target in that strike,"" the statement said. 
""There was an IDF strike nearby that might have caused debris.""
Israeli forces have encircled Gaza's largest city, vowing to crush Hamas in retaliation for bloody October 7 raids into southern Israel that officials say killed around 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
In the deadliest attack in Israel's history, Hamas gunmen also took more than 240 hostages.
The health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, says more than 9,480 Gazans, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israeli strikes and the intensifying ground campaign.

Israel to discuss 'next steps' in Gaza truce talks,"GAZA - ceasefire deal in its war with Hamas, as concern deepened over the growing humanitarian crisis in the war-torn Gaza Strip. 
As aid agencies warned of unprecedented levels of desperation and looming famine, dozens more Gazans were killed in Israeli strikes, the Hamas-run territory's health ministry said.
An Israeli delegation led by Mossad intelligence agency chief David Barnea travelled to Paris for a fresh push towards a deal over a ceasefire. 
National security advisor Tzachi Hanegbi said Israel's war cabinet would meet later Saturday to hear an update after the delegation returned from the talks with mediators. 
""There is probably room to move towards an agreement,"" Hanegbi told N12 News television in an interview, without elaborating. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Saturday's meeting would discuss the ""next steps in the negotiations"". As with a previous week-long truce in November that saw more than 100 hostages freed, Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been spearheading efforts to secure a deal. 
White House envoy Brett McGurk held talks this week with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv, after speaking to other mediators in Cairo who had met Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh. 
As civilians in the besieged territory struggled to get food and supplies, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees warned Gazans were ""in extreme peril while the world watches"". 
In northern Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, bedraggled children held plastic containers and battered cooking pots for what little food was available. 
 
- 'Unprecedented desperation' -
 
Food is running out, with aid agencies unable to get into the area because of the bombing, while the trucks that do try to get through face frenzied looting. Residents have taken to eating scavenged scraps of rotten corn, animal fodder unfit for human consumption and even leaves. 
The World Food Programme said this week its teams reported ""unprecedented levels of desperation"" while the United Nations warned that 2.2 million people were on the brink of famine.
The health ministry said on Saturday that a two-month-old baby identified as Mahmud Fatuh had died of ""malnutrition"" in Gaza City.  
Save the Children said the risk of famine would continue to ""increase as long as the government of Israel continues to impede the entry of aid into Gaza"".Israel has defended its track record on allowing aid into Gaza, saying that 13,000 trucks carrying relief supplies had entered the territory since the start of the war. 
With tempers rising dozens of people in the Jabalia camp on Friday held an impromptu protest.
""We didn't die from air strikes but we are dying from hunger,"" read a sign held by one child. 
 
-  'Bring them back' -
 
The war began after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures. Hamas militants also took hostages, 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 30 presumed dead, according to Israel. 
Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 29,606 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest tally from Gaza's health ministry. 
Pressure has mounted on Netanyahu's government to negotiate a ceasefire and secure the release of the hostages. 
A group representing their families held a rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening to demand swifter action. 
""We keep telling you: bring them back to us! And no matter how,"" said Avivit Yablonka, 45, whose sister Hanan was captured on October 7.  
Hamas said Saturday that Israeli forces launched more than 70 strikes on civilian homes in Gazan cities including Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis and Rafah over the previous 24 hours. 
The health ministry said at least 92 people were killed.
 
- More Rafah strikes -
 
An AFP reporter in Rafah said there had been at least six air strikes on the city on Saturday evening.At Najjar hospital in the city, AFP saw bodies carried from ambulances and placed in the courtyard of the hospital in body bags, while relatives grieved nearby.
Inside the hospital, medics treated several wounded men who were laid out on the floor, one with his head wrapped in bandages.
In Khan Yunis, which has seen heavy fighting in recent weeks, Israel's military said it was ""intensifying the operations"" using tanks, close-range fire and aircraft. 
""The soldiers raided the residence of a senior military intelligence operative"" in the area, a military statement said. 
With war still raging after more than four months, Netanyahu unveiled a plan for post-war Gaza this week which envisages civil affairs being run by Palestinian officials without links to Hamas.The plan has been rejected by both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Israel's key ally the United States said it did not support a ""reoccupation"" or a ""reduction of the size of Gaza"", and said ""Palestinian people should have a voice and a vote... through a revitalised Palestinian Authority"".

US urges 'immediate' ceasefire as Gaza war grinds on,"The US top diplomat stressed Thursday the need for an ""immediate ceasefire"" and a deal to free hostages in war-torn Gaza as he visited Egypt for talks with Arab envoys.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on his latest Middle East crisis tour, was trying to shore up support for a truce as the Israel-Hamas war ground on and experts issued a further warning about the risk of famine in Gaza.
Washington, Israel's top ally, has hardened its tone in recent weeks and circulated for the first time a draft UN Security Council resolution calling for an ""immediate"" end to the fighting.
However, the Israeli bombardment of Gaza has continued with at least 70 people killed overnight, pushing the overall toll towards 32,000, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. Gaza's biggest hospital has emerged as a major flashpoint after Israel launched a days-long raid on Monday that it said had killed more than 140 fighters by Thursday.
Israel said militants were hiding out at the vast Al-Shifa hospital complex and civilians had not been harmed. Hamas said the ongoing attack on an area crowded with patients and people seeking refuge was a crime.
AFP images showed streams of people fleeing south from the hospital along Gaza's coast.
A 60-year-old patient who gave his name as Younis said he had been forced outside without clothes, blindfolded and interrogated before being freed.
The soldiers ""beat all the young men and arrested them"", Younis told AFP.
 
- 'Strong message' -
The US has vetoed previous UN Security Council texts on the war, objecting even last month to the term ""immediate"" in a draft submitted by Algeria.A new version circulated by the US and seen by AFP stressed ""the need for an immediate and durable ceasefire"" to protect civilians and allow aid into the territory.
No vote has been scheduled on the text but Blinken told Saudi media outlet Al Hadath on Wednesday that universal support for the resolution would send a ""strong message"".
The US secretary of state, who will land in Israel on Friday, was due to hold talks on Thursday with ministers from five Arab countries, who released a joint statement backing an immediate ceasefire and urging Israel to open all crossings into Gaza.
In Qatar, mediators were still trying to thrash out a ceasefire deal that would allow hostages to be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and aid deliveries to be increased.
Blinken said a deal was ""very much possible"" though a Hamas official said on Wednesday Israel's response to the group's latest proposal had been ""largely negative"".
The US and Israel are also engaged in a diplomatic tug-of-war over the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the last part of the territory still largely untouched by Israeli ground troops.Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled to the city to escape fighting elsewhere, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted a ground incursion is the only way to finally root out Hamas.
US officials said they supported Netanyahu's goal but wanted Israel to try strategies short of a potentially catastrophic invasion of an area where around 1.5 million people are hemmed in by the Egyptian border.
 
- 'Point of explosion' -
The bloodiest-ever Gaza war broke out after Hamas's attacks resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.Militants also seized about 250 hostages, of whom Israel believes 130 remain in Gaza, including 33 who are presumed dead.
Israel's military has waged a retaliatory offensive against Hamas that has killed 31,988 people, most of them women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.
Tensions have also flared in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 440 Palestinians since the Gaza war began, according to Palestinian officials.
The Israeli military killed four during a pre-dawn raid on a refugee camp near Tulkarem, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.Nabil Abu Rudeina, spokesman for Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, warned that Israel's war had ""dragged the entire region to the point of explosion... and everyone will pay the price for this Israeli recklessness"".
Gaza's civilian infrastructure has largely collapsed in the face of Israel's onslaught and UN agencies are warning that the territory's 2.4 million people are on the brink of famine.
A UN panel of independent experts warned Thursday that children in Gaza were already ""starving to death"". 
""They are cut off from food, even crumbs are not easy to find,"" said the panel that oversees compliance with the UN child rights convention.
UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said this week that ""siege, hunger and diseases will soon become the main killer in Gaza"".And the Saudi government announced it would donate $40 million to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, which has been central to aid operations in Gaza.

Deadly Israel strikes rock Gaza after truce collapses,"GAZA - Israel resumed its deadly bombardment of Gaza on Friday despite international calls for a renewed truce, killing at least 178 people according to Hamas authorities as five hostages held by the militant group were also confimed dead.
Clouds of grey smoke from strikes shot up on the Gaza skyline and rockets fired from the territory streaked into Israel as Israel resumed its offensive, sparked by the deadly Hamas attacks and kidnappings on October 7.
The health ministry in Gaza run by the Palestinian militant group said at least 178 people had been killed there since the pause in hostilities expired early Friday.
UN agencies warned of a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza as hospitals again struggled to cope with the wounded after a week-long respite.Israel alleged that Hamas attempted to break the truce before it ended at 0500 GMT by firing a rocket, and that it failed to produce a list of further hostages for release on Friday after seven earlier exchanges.
As hostilities resumed, Hamas's armed wing received ""the order to resume combat"" and to ""defend the Gaza Strip"", according to a source close to the group who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media.
United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and the White House called for the break in fighting to be restored.
""We continue to work with Israel, Egypt and Qatar on efforts to extend the humanitarian pause in Gaza,"" a US National Security Council spokesperson said.
 
- 'Mother of all thumpings' -
 
Seven days of hostage-prisoner exchanges had yielded tearful reunions of Israeli families with their released relatives and jubilation in the streets of the occupied West Bank as Palestinian prisoners walked free from Israeli jails.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Dubai that the United States remained ""intensely focused on getting everyone home, getting hostages back"" and ""pursuing the process that had worked for seven days"" during the truce.
But Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told reporters: ""Having chosen to hold onto our women, Hamas will now take the mother of all thumpings.""
The Israeli military said ""ground, air and naval forces struck terror targets in the north and south of the Gaza Strip, including in Khan Yunis and Rafah.""Outside the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, a man in a blue sweater bellowed in grief and turned his face and hands to the sky after viewing a dead boy in a body bag, AFPTV footage showed.
""What did he do wrong? God, what did we do to deserve this?"" he yelled.
 
- 'Horror movie' -
 
During the unprecedented October 7 attack, Hamas fighters broke through Gaza's militarised border into Israel, killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped around 240, according to Israeli authorities.
In response, Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas and unleashed an air and ground campaign that the Hamas authorities who run Gaza say has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians.Guterres has warned of a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" in Gaza, where the United Nations says 1.7 million people are displaced and short of food, water and other essentials.
""The healthcare service is on its knees,"" Rob Holden, a World Health Organization (WHO) senior emergency officer, told journalists in Geneva on a video-link from Gaza as explosions were heard in the background.
""It is like a horror movie.""
On a bed at Khan Yunis's Nasser hospital, Amal Abu Dagga wept, her beige veil covered in blood.
""I don't even know what happened to my children,"" she said. A relative, Jamil Abu Dagga, told AFP the family had been at home when the bombs started falling.
In Israel, sirens warning of potential missiles sounded in several communities near Gaza, and authorities said they were restarting security measures in the area, including closing schools.
A rocket strike destroyed a van in one Israeli community near Gaza.
 
- 'Evacuation zones' -
 
Mediation efforts by Qatar and Egypt were ""ongoing"", said a source briefed on the talks who asked not to be named.
During the seven-day truce, Hamas freed 80 Israeli hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners, and more aid entered Gaza.
Twenty-five other hostages, mostly Thais, were also freed in separate arrangements.On Thursday Blinken, meeting Israeli and Palestinian officials, called for the truce to be extended, and warned any resumption of combat must protect Palestinian civilians.
The Israeli military published a map of ""evacuation zones"" in the Gaza Strip that it said would enable residents to ""evacuate from specific places for their safety if required"".
Residents in various areas of Gaza were sent SMS warnings on Friday.
Israeli forces ""will begin a crushing military attack on your area of residence with the aim of eliminating the terrorist organisation Hamas,"" the warnings said.
""Stay away from all military activity of every kind.""
 
- Children held hostage -
 
On Thursday, eight Israeli hostages, some holding dual nationality, were released in the seventh round of exchanges under the truce.The country's prison service later said another 30 Palestinian prisoners -- 23 minors and seven women -- had been freed.
The Israel army confirmed on Friday that five of the hostages seized by Hamas in the attacks had died. It said the Islamist group was still holding ""136 hostages, among them 17 women and children"".
Hamas said it had offered to hand over the bodies of a mother and her two sons -- one of them a baby -- in talks to extend the now-expired truce.
Israeli officials refused to comment on what they called Hamas ""propaganda"".
Shiri Bibas, her 10-month-old son Kfir and his four-year-old brother Ariel, along with their father Yarden, have become emblematic of the October 7 attacks.Hezbollah meanwhile claimed its first attacks on Israel since the truce ended.

Fresh hostage-prisoner releases expected as Gaza truce holds,"TEL AVIV - Hamas fighters were set to release a second group of hostages Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, officials said, as a truce largely held in the devastated Gaza Strip after seven weeks of war that killed thousands of people.
Israeli prison authorities said 42 Palestinian inmates -- both male and female -- would be freed under the agreement which mandates exchanges at a ratio of three to one.
An Israeli official source said 14 hostages would be handed over.
The transfers will follow an initial exchange that occurred Friday, the first day of a four-day truce that largely silenced the guns on both sides.Hamas released 24 hostages in the initial exchange, according to Qatar and an official Israeli list. They included 13 Israelis -- all of whom were women and children. 
Ten Thais and one Filipino were also unexpectedly freed.
Hamas fighters snatched around 240 captives when they broke through Gaza's militarised border with Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners, according to Israeli authorities.
In response to the deadliest attack in its history, Israel launched an air, artillery and naval bombardment alongside a ground offensive to destroy Hamas, killing nearly 15,000 people, according to the Hamas government in Gaza.
 
- Excitement at releases -
 
A video released by Hamas showed masked militants with rifles, wearing military fatigues and the green headband of the Islamist movement's armed wing, handing hostages over to the Red Cross.
Israel in turn freed 39 Palestinian women and children from its prisons.
In a Tel Aviv suburb, people applauded and held up Israeli flags as helicopters flew in the freed captives.
At Israel's Wolfson Medical Center, which received five elderly women hostages, Dr Shoshi Goldner said ""there was no one in the room that could hold his feelings and stop crying"".""You are finally home in a safe place,"" Goldner said.
""Today we are excited about the returnees, but I want us not to forget all those who have not yet returned,"" Yael Adar, daughter-in-law of former hostage Yaffa Adar, 85, told Israel's Ynet news website.
About 215 captives remain in Gaza, though in many cases it is unknown if they are dead or alive, Israeli army spokesman Doron Spielman said.
Hamas is expected to free a total of 50 hostages during the truce in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners, under an agreement brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the United States.
 
- 'Finally home' -
 
""It's only a start, but so far it's gone well,"" US President Joe Biden told reporters, adding ""the chances are real"" for extending the truce.
But Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said on Saturday: ""We all want this truce to turn into a permanent ceasefire and a complete end to this aggression.""Israel's Kibbutz Nir Oz community issued a statement welcoming the release of the Filipino hostage Gelienor (Jimmy) Pacheco, 33. It said he was caregiver to Amitai Ben Zvi, murdered in the October 7 attacks.
Roongarun Wichanguen, sister of 33-year-old Thai hostage Vetoon Phoome, expressed joy and disbelief that he is coming home. She thought he had been killed by Hamas.
On a video call, ""His face was very happy, and he seemed okay,"" she said, adding he told her he ""was taken care of very well. It looks like he just stayed in a house, not the tunnel.""
 
- Palestinians celebrate -
 
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, fireworks exploded and crowds filled the street where they hoisted aloft young men who had been freed from prison. Wearing identical grey jumpers, the freed prisoners waved Palestinian and Hamas flags.
""I spent the end of my childhood and my adolescence in prison, far from my parents and their hugs,"" Marah Bakir, 24, a released female prisoner, told AFP after returning to her home in annexed east Jerusalem.
Bakir served eight years for attempting to kill an Israeli border guard.Earlier in the evening, Israeli security forces fired tear gas to disperse crowds as the prisoners were released. The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli security forces shot and wounded three people. 
In Israel, authorities asked the media to let the newly-freed hostages reunite with loved ones in privacy.
Among those released was Hannah Katzir, 76, who according to her family uses a walking frame and needs medication.
Mothers and their children were also freed, including Doron Katz-Asher, 34, and her two young daughters.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to bring all the Hamas hostages home.
""This is one of the goals of the war,"" he said.
 
- More aid -
 
The pause in fighting in Gaza opened the way for more aid to Gazans struggling to survive with shortages of water and other essentials. Israel had placed Gaza under near-total siege. 
Trucks carrying supplies including fuel, food and medicine, began moving into Gaza through the Rafah crossing from Egypt on Friday, and more entered on Saturday.
In Rafah, many waited to fill gas canisters for cooking. ""All the people are hoping and ready for it to make their lives easier,"" said one resident, Ezzeddine Abu Omeira.
The UN estimates that 1.7 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced by the fighting.
Since the truce, thousands have been returning to what is left of their homes.
""We are civilians,"" said Mahmud Masood, standing in front of flattened buildings in Jabalia, northern Gaza. ""Why have they destroyed our houses?""But after weeks of intensifying cross-border fire, Hezbollah has not claimed any attacks on Israel since the truce came into effect.
An Israeli-owned ship suffered minor damage in a suspected attack by an Iranian drone in the Indian Ocean on Friday, a US defence official said on Saturday.

Blinken starts Mideast tour to press for Gaza truce,"RIYADH - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Saudi Arabia on Monday for another Middle East crisis tour, hoping to secure a new truce in the Israel-Hamas war as Gaza saw no let-up in fighting.
On his fifth trip to the region since Hamas's October 7 attack that triggered the war, Blinken landed in Riyadh and was later expected to visit Israel, Egypt and Qatar. 
Ahead of the trip he stressed the need for ""urgently addressing humanitarian needs in Gaza"", after aid groups have repeatedly sounded the alarm over the devastating impact nearly four months of war have had on the besieged territory.
""The situation is indescribable,"" said Said Hamouda, a Palestinian who fled his home in the Gaza Strip to the southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt. Over the weekend, Israel pressed further south towards the densely-crowded border city, warning that its ground forces could advance on Rafah as part of the campaign to eradicate Hamas.
On Monday morning, sources told AFP they could hear artillery shelling in the areas of eastern Rafah and Khan Yunis, where Israel believes high-ranking Hamas officials are hiding.
At least 128 people, mostly women and children, were killed in Israeli strikes overnight to Monday, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.The Hamas government media office said Israeli bombardment had continued across the centre and south of the coastal Strip, including near hospitals.
The Israeli military said troops operating in the northern and central Gaza Strip had ""killed dozens of terrorists,"" and were engaging with Hamas militants in the Khan Yunis area.
Hamas's armed wing said its militants attacked Israeli troops southwest of Gaza City.
 
- No agreement yet -
 Blinken is expected to discuss a proposed truce thrashed out in a Paris meeting in January of top US, Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials.
The diplomatic push has become more urgent with a surge in attacks across the region by Iran-backed groups in solidarity with Hamas, triggering counterattacks by the United States.
The proposed truce would pause fighting for an initial six weeks as Hamas frees hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, according to a Hamas source.
Hamas has said no agreement has yet been reached, while some Israeli officials have expressed opposition to any perceived concessions.
The war was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.Militants also seized around 250 hostages. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza -- including at least 28 believed to have been killed, according to updated figures from the prime minister's office.
Vowing to eliminate Hamas, Israel launched a massive military offensive that has killed at least 27,478 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry.
Gazans have faced dire humanitarian conditions, and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on social media platform X that ""there is very limited access to clean water and sanitation amid relentless bombardment"". 
UNRWA itself is facing a major controversy after accusations that 12 staff members were involved in Hamas's October 7 attack. 
More than a dozen countries, led by the United States, suspended their funding to the agency after the claims surfaced.
On Sunday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that nations suspending funding to UNRWA were threatening the existence of an agency providing ""vital aid to more than 1.1 million people in Gaza suffering from catastrophic hunger and the outbreak of diseases"".
 
- Humanitarian crisis -
 Before departing for the region, Blinken said the humanitarian crisis would be one of his focuses.
""Urgently addressing humanitarian needs in Gaza and advancing stability in the Middle East are priorities we share with Saudi Arabia,"" Blinken said he told Saudi foreign minister Faisal bin Farhan.
The Gulf state had been mulling establishing formal relations with Israel before the war.
After talks in January with de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Blinken said he still saw a ""clear interest"" in pursuing normalisation.Blinken's latest Middle East visit comes as Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir told the Wall Street Journal that its key ally had not shown sufficient support.
""Instead of giving us his full backing, (US President Joe) Biden is busy with giving humanitarian aid and fuel (to Gaza), which goes to Hamas,"" he said in an article published Sunday. 
His outburst followed Washington imposing sanctions on four settlers amid rising violence against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back at Ben-Gvir, saying: ""I don't need help to know how to navigate our relations with the US and the international community, while standing firm on our national interests."" 
As well as divisions within his cabinet, Netanyahu is also facing public fury over the fate of the remaining hostages.Hundreds of people rallied Saturday in Tel Aviv to demand early elections.
Since the Gaza war broke out, Israel has also traded almost daily rocket fire with Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah across its northern border with Lebanon and evacuated many towns and communities there.
Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Monday that ""time is running out"" to reach a diplomatic solution in south Lebanon.
""Israel will act militarily to return the evacuated citizens"" to its northern border area if no diplomatic solution is reached to end the violence, Katz told his visiting French counterpart Stephane Sejourne.

Battles around Gaza's largest hospital leave many trapped,"JERUSALEM - Hundreds of patients were trapped and thousands of people sought shelter around Gaza's largest hospital on Monday, as Israeli troops and Hamas fighters battled near the compound.
The Al-Shifa facility in Gaza City has become a focal point in the territory's bloodiest ever war, which erupted five weeks ago. 
On October 7, Hamas launched a wave of attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians. 
Israel's relentless campaign in response has killed at least 11,180 people in Gaza, including 4,609 children, according to the Hamas government's media office.
On Sunday, witnesses at the hospital told AFP that ""violent fighting"" raged throughout the night.
The sounds of small arms fire and aerial bombardments were echoing across the sprawling complex, amid reports that the infirm -- including children -- were dying for lack of basic provisions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and other UN agencies said as many as 3,000 patients and staff are sheltering inside without adequate fuel, water or food.
Doctors reported two incubated babies died after power was cut in the neonatal unit and a man had died when his ventilator shut down.""Regrettably, the hospital is not functioning as a hospital anymore,"" said WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, after making contact with on-the-ground staff. 
""It's been three days without electricity, without water,"" he said, describing the situation inside as ""dire and perilous.""
 
- 'No longer functioning' -
 
Israel says that Hamas militants -- who also took 240 people hostage during their October 7 attacks -- are hiding inside the facility and underground tunnel complexes. 
President Isaac Herzog has gone as far as describing Al-Shifa as Hamas's operational ""headquarters"", but denied that Israeli forces had targeted the facility.
Youssef Abu Rish, deputy health minister in the Hamas government, on Sunday said three more premature babies had died along with six other patients who had been in critical condition.
""We fear the toll will rise further by morning,"" he said.
Across Gaza City at the Al-Quds hospital the picture was also said to be dire, with the Palestinian Red Crescent warning it was now out of service due to lack of generator fuel.
Twenty of Gaza's 36 hospitals are ""no longer functioning"", according to the UN's humanitarian agency.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned Hamas for using ""hospitals and civilians as human shields"", while urging Israel to show ""maximum restraint"".
 
- 'Self-evacuation' -With Israel facing intense pressure to minimise civilian deaths and suffering, the military on Sunday announced the opening of a ""self-evacuation corridor"" from Al-Shifa southward.
Tens of thousands of Gazans have already fled from the north of the territory under Israeli orders.
But it is unclear what provisions there would be for the sick and injured to be transported from Al-Shifa.
The Israeli army also said its ground soldiers had hand-delivered 300 litres of fuel to the hospital ""for urgent medical purposes"".
The military shared grainy night-time footage of combat troops hauling jerry cans and leaving a dozen or more outside a building.
AFP was unable to independently verify the footage, or Israel's claim that Hamas ""forbade the hospital from taking it.""
Only a handful of trucks carrying fuel had been let into Gaza since October 7, with Israel concerned fuel deliveries would be used by Hamas militants.
Al-Shifa director Mohammad Abu Salmiya told journalists the Israeli claims were ""lies"".
The 300 litres the army said had been delivered would power generators for ""no more than quarter of an hour"" anyway, Abu Salmiya said.
Inside the hospital, AFP last week witnessed the sick and injured on gurneys that packed corridor walls.    
The courtyard of the emergency ward was dotted with people and piles of rubbish lay uncollected. 
Some of the thousands displaced by the fighting camped at the facility using make-shift kitchens and what few supplies they had.
Almost 1.6 million people -- about two-thirds of Gaza's population -- have been internally displaced since October 7, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out calls for the ceasefire, saying Hamas must first release the hostages.
Israelis, still stunned by the worst attack in their country's history and preoccupied with the fate of hostages, are in little mood to compromise.  
A recent poll by the Israel Democracy Institute showed many Israelis back talks with Hamas to secure the release of hostages, but believe fighting should not be halted.
Netanyahu told US media that ""there could be"" a deal to free some of the hostages, but stopped short of providing any details.
""The less I say about it, the more I'll increase the chances that it materialises,"" he told NBC.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told MSNBC there has been ""active negotiation"" on a potential deal but kept mum on any details, while a Palestinian official in Gaza accused Israel of dragging its feet.
""Netanyahu is responsible for the delay and obstacles in reaching a preliminary agreement on the release of several prisoners,"" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

Australia skipper Cummins backs Khawaja on Gaza views,"Australia captain Pat Cummins threw his support behind star opener Usman Khawaja Monday, saying his bid to bring attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza was ""not offensive"".
Khawaja has been denied permission by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to have a sticker showing a black dove holding an olive branch on his bat and shoes during the second Test against Pakistan.
The logo, which he displayed during training on Sunday, also had the words 01:UDHR -- a reference to Article One of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- written on it.
The 36-year-old, a Muslim, was stopped from wearing shoes emblazoned with the hand-written slogans ""Freedom is a human right"" and ""All lives are equal"" during the first Test in Perth.
The ICC said they flouted its rules on messages that relate to politics, religion or race.
""We really support Uzzy. He's standing up for what he believes and I think he's done it really respectfully,"" Cummins told reporters on the eve of the Test in Melbourne.
""As I said last week, 'All lives are equal', I don't think that's very offensive and I'd say the same about the dove.
""That's Uzzy. I think he can really hold his head high with the way he's gone about it.
""But obviously there's rules in place and I believe the ICC have said they're not going to approve that. They make up the rules and you've got to accept it.""
Khawaja wore a black armband during the Perth Test and was reprimanded by the ICC, but insisted it was for a ""personal bereavement"" and not politically-motivated.
Last week, he spoke about how the Israel-Hamas conflict had affected him.
""When I'm looking at my Instagram and seeing innocent kids, videos of them dying, passing away, that's what hit me the hardest,"" he said.
""I don't have any agendas other than trying to shine a light on what I feel really passionately, really strongly about.""",Monday 25 December 2023 - 05:05am
Israel must 'ensure urgent humanitarian assistance' in Gaza: ICJ,"GAZA CITY - The world's top court on Thursday ordered Israel to ""ensure urgent humanitarian assistance"" in Gaza without delay, saying ""famine has set in"".
The International Court of Justice's latest order comes as heavy street battles continued to rage in besieged Gaza -- and a major medical charity said it ""hasn't seen any change"" since a United Nations Security Council resolution this week demanding an immediate ceasefire.
""Israel shall... take all necessary and effective measures to ensure, without delay... the unhindered provision... of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance"" in Gaza, the ICJ said.
This included food, water, electricity, fuel, shelter, clothing, hygiene and sanitation requirements, as well as medical supplies and medical care to Palestinians throughout Gaza, its judges said. 
""Palestinians in Gaza are no longer facing only a risk of famine, but... famine is setting in,"" the Hague-based court said.
The war erupted after Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza on October 7, resulting in about 1,160 deaths -- mostly civilians -- according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages, of whom Israel believes 130 remain in Gaza, including 34 who are presumed dead.
Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 32,552 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
 
- 'Dying of starvation' -
 
At the ICJ, South Africa has charged that Israel is perpetrating a genocide in Gaza, an accusation strongly denied by Israel.
Pretoria dragged Israel before the court, saying it was in breach of its obligations under the 1948 UN Genocide Convention, and urging the court to order a ceasefire.
In a ruling in mid-January that made headlines worldwide, the ICJ ordered Israel to do everything it could to prevent genocide during its Gaza offensive.
The court also ruled that Israel must allow aid into Gaza to ease the desperate humanitarian situation there.
South Africa followed up with a request for fresh measures a few weeks later, citing an announced incursion into the city of Rafah, but the court declined to impose additional measures.
Undeterred, Pretoria tried again, this time urging the court to impose emergency measures to ""save the Palestinian people in Gaza already dying of starvation"".
Israel said South Africa was ""engaged in an abusive exploitation of the court's procedures"".
But the ICJ's judges said Thursday that the mid-January rulings ""do not fully address the consequences arising from the changes in the situation... thus justifying the modification of these measures"".
Pretoria hailed the latest ICJ decision, calling it ""significant"".  
 
- 'Unhindered humanitarian aid' -
 
Meanwhile street battles raged Thursday near a hospital in Gaza, with the humanitarian crisis and surging death toll causing tensions between Israel and its top ally the United States.
Tensions flared after Washington on Monday allowed the UN Security Council to pass its first-ever resolution calling for an ""immediate ceasefire"" and hostage release in Gaza by abstaining from the vote.
Washington on Thursday said it was still reviewing the ICJ's decision and had no immediate comment on its substance.
""But as a general proposition, of course, increasing humanitarian assistance to Gaza is something that we support and something that we have urged Israel to help facilitate,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. 
The MSF medical charity said Thursday that there was no change on the ground since the Security Council resolution.
What is needed is an immediate and lasting ceasefire, a halt to all attacks on medical installations and personnel, and ""unhindered humanitarian aid in Gaza"", MSF's international president Christos Christou told AFP.
While the war has turned much of the territory into a devastated wasteland of collapsed buildings and tank tracks, Israel has also imposed a siege on its 2.4 million people, eased only by occasional aid deliveries.
The ICJ was set up to rule on disputes between states and while its judgements are legally binding, it has little means to enforce them.
For example, the court has ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine, to no avail.

Civilians trapped by fighting in Gaza,"JOHANNESBURG - Thousands of civilians were trapped in southern Gaza by bombardment and fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters on Saturday, a day after the top UN court ruled Israel must prevent genocidal acts.
Growing alarm has focused on Khan Yunis, the biggest city in Gaza's south, where the two main hospitals were barely functioning under the weight of the relentless bombardment and the press of thousands in need.
Witnesses reported more overnight strikes on Khan Yunis, the current epicentre of Israel's assault on Gaza, and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said some of the dead and wounded had been taken to the city's barely functioning Al-Amal hospital.
The strikes came after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that Israel must prevent possible acts of genocide in its war against Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza.
The court, which has virtually no enforcement power, stopped short of calling for an end to the fighting but also said in its ruling that Israel must facilitate ""urgently needed"" humanitarian assistance.
""This is the first time the world has told Israel that it is out of line,"" said Maha Yasin, a 42-year-old displaced Palestinian woman in Gaza.""What Israel did to us in Gaza for four months has never happened in history."" 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the case as ""outrageous"".
Israel's relentless bombardment and siege of the Palestinian territory began soon after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attacks that resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages and Israel says around 132 of them remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead captives.
Israel has vowed to crush Hamas and the health ministry in Gaza says the Israeli military offensive has killed at least 26,083 people, about 70 percent of them women and children.
 
- Hospital services 'collapse' -
  
Fierce fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters has raged for days around Khan Yunis, forcing tens of thousands to flee further south to Rafah on the border with Egypt.With a humanitarian crisis growing in Khan Yunis and northern areas of Gaza, UN agencies say most of the estimated 1.7 million Palestinians displaced by the war are crowded into Rafah.
At Khan Yunis's Nasser Hospital, the largest in the besieged city, Doctors Without Borders said surgical capacity was ""virtually non-existent"".
The international medical aid organisation said in a news release that medical services at the hospital had ""collapsed"" and the few staff who remained ""must contend with very low supplies that are insufficient to handle mass casualty events"".
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on social media platform X that 350 patients and 5,000 people displaced by the fighting remained at the hospital and that fighting in the vicinity continued.
He said the Nasser Hospital was ""running out of food, fuel and supplies"" and called for an immediate ceasefire so they could be replenished.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Israeli tanks were targeting Al-Amal hospital, another of the few remaining medical facilities in Khan Yunis, and that it was ""under siege with heavy gunfire"".
The Israeli military accuses Hamas of having tunnels under hospitals in Gaza and of using the medical facilities as command centres.
Meirav Eilon Shahar, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, accused the WHO this week of collusion with Hamas by ignoring Israeli evidence of Hamas's ""military use"" of Gaza hospitals.
Tedros rejected the accusation, saying it could ""endanger our staff who are risking their lives to serve the vulnerable"".
 
- Diplomatic relations sour -
 
Relations between Israel and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees soured after the UNRWA said tanks had shelled one of its shelters in Khan Yunis on Wednesday, killing 13 people.UNRWA said on Friday it had sacked several employees accused by Israel of involvement in the October 7 attack.
The UN Security Council will meet on Wednesday to discuss the ICJ's ruling, the council's presidency announced.
The European Union called for the ""immediate"" application of the ICJ's decision.
The ruling in The Hague was based on an urgent application brought by South Africa, long a supporter of the Palestinian cause, but a broader judgment on whether genocide has been committed could take years.
A security source told AFP on Friday that the head of the US Central Intelligence Agency will meet officials from Israel, Egypt and Qatar ""in the coming days in Paris"" to try to reach a deal with Hamas.The war has led to fears of wider conflict, and US forces said they had struck a target in Huthi-held Yemen after an attack on a British tanker in the Gulf of Aden.

Alarm has surged about the spiralling humanitarian crisis in Gaza amid the war sparked by the October 7 Hamas attack. 
On a day when Israel's army reported more than 300 new strikes within 24 hours, Gaza's health ministry said the death toll had surged above 5,000, more than 2,000 of them children, in figures AFP has not been able to independently verify.
Thousands of buildings have been destroyed and more than one million people displaced in the territory that has been under siege and largely deprived of water, food and other basic supplies.About a dozen trucks carrying desperately needed aid -- the third convoy in three days -- arrived inside Gaza from Egypt on Monday through Rafah, Gaza's only crossing not controlled by Israel.
The United States, which has brokered the entry of the aid convoys, has vowed a ""continued flow"" of relief goods into Gaza, even as UN aid agencies have said far more is needed.
Fighting raged unabated overnight, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed again that Israel would ""erase Hamas"" and as a full-scale ground invasion loomed.Gaza's Hamas-controlled government media office said that ""more than 60 were martyred in the raids"" during the night -- including 17 in a single strike that hit a house in Gaza's north -- and at least 10 others were killed in new strikes early Monday.
The Israeli military said it had hit ""over 320 military targets in the Gaza Strip"" in the past 24 hours.
It said the targets ""included tunnels containing Hamas terrorists, dozens of operational command centres"" as well as ""military compounds and observation posts"" used by Islamic Jihad, another militant group.
 
- Call for blood donations -
 
Rafah resident Mohammed Abu Sabalah said he had returned home from the local mosque after dawn prayers Monday and that ""a quarter of an hour later there was a bombing"".""We couldn't see anything because of the thick smoke,"" he said, adding that ""we thank God that we've emerged safe and sound"" with ""only a few windows and doors destroyed"".
Israeli forces are massed near the Gaza border, and smaller units have already carried out limited incursions, targeting Hamas and hoping to rescue hostages, whose number Israel now puts at 222.
In one such operation, a 19-year-old Israeli soldier was killed and three others wounded, the army said, adding that the tank operation had aimed ""to dismantle terror infrastructure... and locate missing persons and bodies"".
Tensions have been inflamed in the occupied West Bank, where 95 Palestinians have been killed in clashes involving Israeli security forces or settlers since fighting began in Gaza, according to the Ramallah-based health ministry.Israel kept evacuating southern communities near Gaza.
Orit Cohen, 29, a native of Sderot, an Israeli town just near Gaza's northern border, told AFP: ""I came to pick up my mother who until then refused to leave the city. But the army is bombing right on the other side.
""I was afraid for her and I came to get her out of here.""Alarm has grown about the dire needs of the 2.4 million civilians trapped inside the 40-kilometre long coastal strip that was already blockaded and impoverished before the war.
Children killed in an Israeli air strike in the southern city of Khan Yunis were Monday laid to rest in a makeshift grave, while in Rafah men were filling plastic jerrycans from containers with now scare safe drinking water.
US President Joe Biden brokered the passage of aid convoys with Egyptian and Israeli leaders in talks last week -- but the United Nations estimates Gaza needs about 100 trucks of relief goods every day.UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said Sunday's delivery of food, water and medical supplies was ""another small glimmer of hope for the millions of people in dire need of humanitarian aid.
""But they need more, much more.""
Israel has rejected the entry of fuel into Gaza, fearing Hamas could use it for weapons and explosives.
This has sparked warnings that soon Gaza's ambulances, hospital incubators for infants and water desalination plants will soon stop functioning.
 
- Hezbollah warning -
 Around the world, Israel's friends and foes alike have warned against the Gaza war spilling over into a full-scale regional conflagration.
Israel's arch enemy Iran has repeatedly warned of an escalation, as have its allied armed groups, including Lebanon's Hezbollah, which has traded cross-border fire with Israel.
Netanyahu warned on Sunday that if Hezbollah were to get more deeply involved, it would be ""the mistake of its life"".
""We will strike it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the significance for it and the state of Lebanon will be devastating,"" he said.Israeli air strikes have been reported against two airports in Syria, a mosque it said were used by ""terror operatives"" in the West Bank city of Jenin, and Hezbollah ""military infrastructure"" inside Lebanon.
Hamas, Hezbollah and Syria's government are all backed by Iran, which opposes Israel's existence and has warned the region could spiral ""out of control"".
Washington said it would not hesitate to act in the event of any ""escalation"", just hours after the Pentagon moved to step up military readiness in the region.
""If any group or any country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate situation that we see, our advice is: don't,"" US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on ABC News.Palestinian prime minister Muhammad Shtayyeh charged that Israel's planned Gaza invasion would mean ""new crimes, atrocities, forced displacement and killing for the sake of killing and revenge"".

Gaza truce efforts revived as first aid ship unloaded,"Efforts towards a truce in the Israel-Hamas war appeared to rekindle on Saturday after a new proposal from the Palestinian militant group which also called for more aid into Gaza, where the first food shipment by sea reached shore.
Israel said it would send a delegation to Qatar for a new round of talks on a possible deal. It also advanced plans for a military operation in Rafah, where most of Gaza's population has sought refuge from more than five months of war and deprivation.
The US charity World Central Kitchen said its team had finished unloading almost 200 tonnes of food, the first shipment to arrive on a new maritime aid corridor from Cyprus.
""All cargo was offloaded and is being readied for distribution in Gaza,"" it said in a statement.
The Cypriot government said that a second aid ship, the Jennifer, was set ""to depart for Gaza today (Saturday) or tomorrow"".
The vessel was expected to carry 240 tonnes of food, World Central Kitchens said.The United Nations has reported particular difficulty in accessing north Gaza to distribute food and other aid.
Residents say they have resorted to eating wild plants and animal fodder, and some have stormed the few aid trucks that have made it through.
""Doctors are reporting that they no longer see normal-sized babies,"" Dominic Allen, of the United Nations Population Fund, said after visiting the area.
 
- 'God help us' -
With the situation increasingly dire, donors have turned to deliveries by air or sea.
Multiple governments have begun daily aid airdrops over Gaza. The German air force said on Saturday it successfully made its first aid drop over north Gaza.
The new maritime corridor is to be complemented by a temporary pier which US troops are on their way to build.
But air and sea missions are no alternative to land deliveries, UN agencies say. Humanitarians have cited Israeli restrictions as among the obstacles they face.
Before the war an average of around 500 trucks a day entered Gaza, the UN has said, but the current number is a fraction of that.Earlier Saturday, ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra reported 36 deaths from a strike on a house sheltering displaced people in Nuseirat, central Gaza.
AFPTV images showed a building blown apart. Yussef Tabatibi said survivors were trying to recover the dead with only their bare hands.
""What should we do? God help us,"" he said.
Witnesses reported air strikes and fighting in the southern Gaza Strip's main city Khan Yunis as well as parts of the north.
 
- Talks -In negotiations aimed at securing a truce and hostage release deal, Hamas has put forward a new proposal for a six-week ceasefire and the exchange of about 42 Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, an official from the Islamist group told AFP.
Palestinian militants seized about 250 Israeli and foreign hostages during the Hamas attack which triggered the war on October 7. 
Dozens of captives were released during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes about 130 remain in Gaza, including 32 presumed dead.
The Hamas attack resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 31,553 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry.
Until Friday, Hamas had insisted no further hostages would be exchanged without a permanent ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.
Now the militants are saying that, during a six-week truce, Israeli forces would need to pull out of ""all cities and populated areas"" in Gaza, according to the Hamas official.The Hamas proposal also calls for more humanitarian aid, the official added. 
Israel has so far rejected withdrawing troops from Gaza, saying such a move would amount to victory for Hamas.
The White House said Friday it was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the prospects for a new truce after the latest proposal from Hamas but stressed that negotiations were far from over.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel would send a delegation to Qatar for a new round of talks.
Israel did not attend earlier negotiations in Cairo that failed to secure a truce for the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which began on Monday.
 
- 'Not self-defence' -
The United States, which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military assistance, has grown increasingly critical of Netanyahu over his handling of the war.
US President Joe Biden praised unusually critical comments by Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who described Netanyahu as one of several ""major obstacles"" to peace and called for a snap Israeli election.
""I think he expressed serious concern shared not only by him, but by many Americans,"" Biden said.
Netanyahu's office said on Friday he had approved the military's plan for an operation against Hamas in Rafah, where around 1.5 million people have sought refuge, many sheltering in tents along the Egyptian border.
There was no timeline for the long-threatened operation which Washington has said it cannot support without a ""credible, achievable, executable plan"" to shelter civilians.

The Israel-Hamas military balance,"TEL AVIV - Israel has one of the best-resourced militaries in the world, heavily supported by Washington. In Hamas, it faces a highly trained armed group with powerful regional allies.
With both sides poised for an Israeli ground offensive in the wake of the deadly attack on Israel by Hamas on October 7, here is an overview of their military resources. 
 
- Israel -
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) number 169,500, of which 126,000 are army, according to Britain's International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).
On top of that, it has 400,000 reservists, of which 360,000 have been mobilised since the Hamas attack.
Israel also has some of the most technologically advanced defences in the world, including the ""Iron Dome"" anti-missile system. 
IISS says it has around 1,300 tanks and other armoured vehicles, 345 fighter jets and a vast arsenal of artillery, drones and state-of-the-art submarines. 
Though not a declared nuclear state, Israel's nuclear weapons cache is an open secret and the Arms Control Association puts its number of warheads at 90. 
 
- US ally -Washington provides $3.8 billion per year to Israel in military aid under a 10-year agreement running until 2028.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Sunday that he had activated deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and additional Patriot battalions ""throughout the region"".
He added that he had put ""an additional number of forces on prepare-to-deploy orders ... to increase their readiness and ability to quickly respond as required.""
Washington had already delivered increased munitions to Israel and deployed two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean -- the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest warship, and the USS Eisenhower -- to deter not just Hamas but also its allies Iran and the Lebanese Islamist movement Hezbollah.
The US military on Tuesday ordered 2,000 personnel to prepare for deployment to the Middle East as a show of force.
 
- Hamas -
Hamas has a diverse arsenal built up over many years. 
Its armed forces, called the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, numbers 15,000 men according to IISS, though it notes that Arab media have put the figure at 40,000.
They have heavy weapons obtained from across the Middle East -- particularly Iran, Syria and Libya -- and has also sourced handguns and assault rifles from China and other regions.
It also has a variety of locally made, improvised explosives and Western sources say enough drones, mines, anti-tank guided missiles, grenade launchers and mortar shells to hold out for a long period, though precise figures are unavailable. 
The majority of its rockets are also locally manufactured and technologically rudimentary. 
 
- Hezbollah -
There have already been exchanges across the border between Israel and Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah is based. ""Hezbollah can tie up IDF resources without having to fully commit to the fight, instead relying on occasional rocket or missile strikes to prevent the Israelis from growing complacent and forcing the IDF to commit manpower and materiel along the northern border,"" said the Soufan Center, a US think tank.
In 2021, the group claimed to have 100,000 fighters. The Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), an Israeli think tank, says the number is half that. 
""Most Hezbollah militants are not full-time fighters, but rather engage in militant activity as and when required by the group's commanders,"" according to Elliot Chapman of the British defence analysis firm Janes.
Hezbollah mobilised 40,000 men at the outbreak of Syria's civil war, he noted.
INSS says the group's arsenal counts 150,000 to 200,000 rockets and missiles, including ""hundreds"" of precision rockets. 
""Strategically, Hezbollah's rocket arsenal is the group's most significant capability for fighting Israel,"" Chapman said.
 
- Iran -
Since its Islamic revolution in 1979, Iran has made support for Palestinians one of the pillars of its ideology. 
Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian warned Sunday that ""The region is like a powderkeg ... I warn the United States and its proxy (Israel) that if they do not immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza, anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control"".
Western analysts minimise the threat of Iran becoming directly involved and point rather to its support from Hamas, Hezbollah and Huthi rebels in Yemen -- a so-called ""axis of resistance"" of Israel's enemies. 
Raz Zimmt, of INSS, said Iran currently had ""no interest in Hezbollah engaging in an all-out war"" that might threaten such a key ""strategic asset"". 
But he added that Tehran's hand could be forced by ""an Israeli ground invasion, and especially Israeli military success, which will threaten the very survival of Hamas and/or its ability to maintain effective control over the Gaza Strip"".

Hamas chief in Egypt for talks on Gaza truce and hostage release,"JERUSALEM - The leader of Hamas visited Egypt on Wednesday as hopes grew that Israel and the Palestinian militant group may be inching toward another truce and hostage release deal in the Gaza war.
The Qatar-based Hamas chief, Ismail Haniyeh, arrived in Cairo for discussions on the ""aggression in the Gaza Strip and other matters"", the group said in a statement. 
He was due to meet Egypt's spy chief for talks on ""stopping the aggression and the war to prepare an agreement for the release of prisoners"", a source close to the group told AFP.Haniyeh -- who earlier met Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in Qatar -- was heading a ""high-level delegation"" to Egypt, a frequent mediator between Israel and the Palestinians, the source said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had told hostage families late Tuesday that he had twice sent his spy chief to Europe in efforts to ""free our hostages"".
""It's our duty, I'm responsible for the release of all the hostages,"" the premier told the relatives of some of the 129 captives still believed to be held in Gaza. ""Saving them is a supreme task. ""I have just sent the head of Mossad to Europe twice to promote a process to free our hostages. I will spare no effort on the subject, and our duty is to bring them all back.""
US news site Axios reported Monday that Mossad chief David Barnea had met CIA director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Europe.
Qatar, backed by Egypt and the United States, helped broker a week-long truce in November in which 80 Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
Axios has also reported that Israel had offered to pause the fighting for at least one week in exchange for more than three dozen hostages held by Hamas.The war began when Hamas militants burst out of Gaza on October 7, killing around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250, according an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel began a campaign of bombardment, and then a ground invasion, that Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says have killed 19,667 people, mostly women and children.
 
- UN vote expected -
 Israeli President Isaac Herzog also said Tuesday his country was ""ready for another humanitarian pause and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages"".
Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, meanwhile, released video footage it claimed showed two hostages alive in its custody in Gaza, ramping up pressure on Israel.
The UN Security Council was set to vote Wednesday on a resolution calling for a pause in the conflict, three diplomatic sources told AFP, after two previous votes were delayed as members wrangled over wording.
The latest version of the text calls for the ""suspension"" of hostilities, the sources said.The US vetoed a previous ceasefire resolution, sparking condemnation by Palestinian and humanitarian groups, which urged more action to help civilians caught in the conflict.
For now, fighting was raging unabated after Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said Tuesday that troops were expanding operations in southern Gaza's Khan Yunis area.
""We must dismantle Hamas, and it will take as long as needed,"" he said, as the army said 133 soldiers had been killed since ground operations began in late October.
Hamas sources said Wednesday at least 11 people were killed overnight in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip.
In Khan Yunis, residents searched by hand through the rubble of a building completely flattened by a strike.
The house was ""full of people, full of human beings, why did they bomb it? What's the reason?"" said one distraught young resident, Amr Sheikh-Dib. 
""We managed to remove some bodies, but where are the rest of them? What did these people do?""
The UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million residents have been displaced and concerns are growing about the limited ability of aid groups to help.""Amid displacement at an unimaginable scale and active hostilities, the humanitarian response system is on the brink,"" said Tor Wennesland, the UN's special coordinator for the Middle East peace process.
Gazans are facing a perilous winter, and the UN children's agency warned that ""child deaths due to disease could surpass those killed in bombardments"".  
The United States, while strongly backing Israel, has also urged it to protect civilians in Gaza.
The call was echoed by British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who on Tuesday called on Israel to take a ""much more surgical, clinical and targeted approach"" in its battle against Hamas.
 
- Red Sea attacks -
 The Gaza war has sparked fears of regional escalation and seen Israel trade deadly cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon.
Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels, meanwhile, have repeatedly fired missiles and drones at vessels passing through the Red Sea that they say are linked to Israel, in a show of support for Palestinians.
Major shipping firms have diverted their vessels as a result, taking the far costlier route around Africa.
The United States on Monday announced a new multinational naval task force to protect the waterway leading to the Suez Canal, through which more than 10 percent of global trade transits.
It now includes warships from the United States, which has its USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the area, as well as Britain, Canada, France, Italy and other countries.Malaysia meanwhile said it had barred Israeli-flagged cargo ships from docking at its ports in response to Israel's actions in Gaza, which it said ignore ""basic humanitarian principles"".

'No excuse for hitting a hospital' in Gaza: EU chief,"STRASBOURG - EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said there is ""no excuse for hitting a hospital full of civilians"" in Gaza, but did not apportion blame for the blast.
The European Commission president told EU lawmakers the ""facts need to be established"" on the overnight strike on the Gaza hospital which killed at least 200.
Israel and Palestinians accuse each other for the blast, which has triggered street protests in the Middle East against Israel.
Von der Leyen, speaking before the European Parliament in Strasbourg, said the overnight explosion turned the hospital into ""a hell of fire"".
""All those responsible must be held accountable,"" she said.
Von der Leyen, who visited Israel last Friday in a show of solidarity with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, has been criticised by some European Union countries for perceived bias to the Israeli side at the expense of Palestinian civilians.
That prompted a summit of EU leaders by videoconference late Tuesday to emphasise the bloc's twin message: that Israel has the right to defend itself following Hamas's bloody October 7 assault -- but only in line with its commitments under international humanitarian law.
Hamas on October 7 sent fighters through the Gaza Strip's heavily militarised border, killing more than 1,400 people. They also took nearly 200 hostages.
Israel has been relentlessly bombing Gaza in response, killing over 3,000 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory.
In her parliamentary address, von der Leyen said ""we must redouble our efforts to protect citizens from the fury of war"".
But she said Hamas was the underlying reason for the ordeal Palestinians are now going through.
""Hamas are terrorists. And the Palestinian people are also suffering from that terror,"" she said.
She added that the EU needs to keep supporting the Palestinians, ""and there is no contradiction in standing in solidarity with Israel"".
""Europe stands with Israel in this dark moment,"" Von der Leyen said, adding that ""Israel should act as a democracy, in line with international humanitarian law"".",Wednesday 18 October 2023 - 10:55am
Israel forces fire on Gazans rushing for food aid,"Israeli forces in war-torn Gaza opened fire on Palestinians scrambling for food aid in a chaotic melee on Thursday that the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said killed more than 100 people.
The Israeli military said a ""stampede"" occurred when thousands of Gazans surrounded a convoy of 30 aid trucks, leading to dozens of deaths and injuries, including some who were run over by the lorries.  
An Israeli source acknowledged troops had opened fire on the crowd, believing it ""posed a threat"". 
The Gaza health ministry condemned what it called a ""massacre"" before dawn in Gaza City in which 104 people were killed and more than 750 others wounded.The incident adds to a Palestinian death toll from the war which the ministry earlier Thursday said had topped 30,000, and dampens hopes a truce deal between Israel and Hamas militants could be just days away.
A witness in Gaza City said the violence unfolded when thousands of people desperate for food rushed towards aid trucks at the city's western Nabulsi roundabout.""Trucks full of aid came too close to some army tanks that were in the area and the crowd, thousands of people, just stormed the trucks,"" the witness said, declining to be named for safety reasons.
""The soldiers fired at the crowd as people came too close to the tanks.""
The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also said many of the dead were crushed by the trucks when they were ""overwhelmed by people trying to loot"".
Aerial images released by the Israeli army showed what it said were scores of Gazans surrounding aid trucks in Gaza City.
 
- 'Another day from hell'  -
President Joe Biden said the United States was checking ""two competing versions"" of the incident.When asked if the death toll was likely to complicate efforts by US and other mediators to broker a truce, Biden replied: ""I know it will."" 
He said later that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was now unlikely to happen by Monday -- the timeline that he had predicted earlier this week. 
UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said he was ""appalled at the reported killing and injury of hundreds of people during a transfer of aid supplies"" and warned ""life is draining out of Gaza at terrifying speed"".
Saudi Arabia strongly condemned what it called the ""targeting"" of unarmed civilians. Italy called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza to facilitate more humanitarian aid.The UN Security Council will hold a closed-door emergency meeting on the incident on Thursday afternoon, which a diplomatic source said was requested by Algeria. 
Looting of aid trucks had previously occurred in northern Gaza, where residents have taken to eating animal fodder and even leaves to try to stave off starvation, as aid groups warn of looming famine after nearly five months of war. 
The chief of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said that no UN agency had been involved in Thursday's aid delivery, and called it ""another day from hell"". 
 
- Truce hopes -
The war began on October 7 with an unprecedented Hamas attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of around 1,160 people, mostly civilians, Israeli figures show.  Militants also took about 250 hostages, 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 31 Israel says are presumed dead.  
Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed 30,035 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry.
Israel's military says 242 soldiers have died in Gaza since ground operations began in late October.  
Washington, a key ally of Israel, has recently been pushing for a reduction in civilian casualties and a ceasefire.
It has been working with mediators from Egypt and Qatar to seek a six-week pause in the war. Negotiators had hoped a truce could begin by around March 10 or 11 when the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins, depending on the lunar calendar.
The proposals reportedly include the release of some Israeli hostages held in Gaza by militants in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
Short of the complete withdrawal Hamas has called for, a source from the group said the deal might see Israeli forces leave ""cities and populated areas"", allowing the return of some displaced Palestinians and humanitarian relief.
 
- Fears of famine -
The World Food Programme has said Israel has blocked access for aid deliveries -- which Israeli officials have denied -- and warned that if nothing changes, ""a famine is imminent in northern Gaza"".As fighting continued in Gaza, Muhammad Yassin, 35, battled to find flour in Zeitun. 
""I found thousands of people waiting for long hours just to get a kilo (2.2 pounds) or two kilos of flour,"" he said. 
""We have not eaten a loaf of bread for two months. Our children are starving.""
In the south, nearly 1.5 million people trying to flee the fighting are now packed into Rafah city, also short of food, as Israel threatens to send in troops against Hamas fighters. 
On Thursday, Israel's military said it had also killed militants in central Gaza as well as in Gaza City's Zeitun area, while intense fighting took place in Khan Yunis city just a few kilometres (miles) from Rafah.A group of 150 Israelis have started a four-day march from Reim, near the Gaza border, to Jerusalem, calling for the government to reach a deal.
Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank, where two Israelis were killed on Thursday.

"'Sliver of hope' as Hamas releases hostages, but Gaza aid stalled","Hamas released two American hostages held in Gaza, offering a ""sliver of hope"" to desperate families, as Israel pounded the densely-populated territory where millions waited for promised aid deliveries on Saturday.
The Islamist group took more than 200 people hostage when it stormed into Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, and killed at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians who were shot, mutilated or burnt to death on the first day of the raid, according to Israeli officials.
The fate of the hostages has been shrouded in uncertainty, so the release of mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan offered a rare ""sliver of hope"", said Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
US President Joe Biden said he was ""overjoyed"" by the release, which comes days after he visited Israel to express solidarity with the wounded country and press for humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Trucks carrying relief the United Nations calls a ""lifeline"" are still stuck on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing into Gaza, though Biden said movement could begin in the ""next 24 to 48 hours.""
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas, and says around 1,500 of the group's fighters were killed in clashes before its army regained control of the area under attack on October 7.
Biden said Friday he believes the attack was motivated partly by Saudi Arabia's plan to recognise Israel.Israel's military campaign has levelled entire city blocks in Gaza, killing 4,137 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.                                                      Israeli troops are massed on the border with Gaza ahead of an expected ground invasion that officials have pledged will begin ""soon.""
But a full-blown land offensive carries many risks, including to hostages from Israel and around the world held by Hamas.   
- 'Overwhelming sense of joy' -
There were no immediate details about the health of the released hostages, but Biden said he had spoken to them and promised US support ""as they recover from this terrible ordeal.""
He thanked Qatar, which hosts Hamas' political bureau, for its mediation in securing the release, and said he was working ""around the clock"" to win the return of other Americans being held.               
Natalie Raanan's half-brother Ben told the BBC he felt an ""overwhelming sense of joy"" at the release after ""the most horrible of ordeals.""
Hamas said Egypt and Qatar had negotiated the release and it was ""working with all mediators to implement the movement's decision to close the civilian (hostage) file if appropriate security conditions allow"".
There is little information about the hostages, though Israel's military said Friday ""the majority"" are still alive, and agonised families have demanded more action.
""Absolutely nothing has been done,"" Assaf Shem Tov, whose nephew was abducted from a music festival, said Friday.""We ask humanity to interfere and bring back all those young boys, young girls, mothers, babies.""
In Gaza, Israeli jets continued a relentless bombing campaign, with the military saying it hit more than 100 Hamas targets overnight.
AFP reporters heard loud explosions and saw plumes of smoke billowing from the northern Gaza Strip, which Israel has demanded Palestinian civilians leave for their own safety.
- 'Life and death' aid -
Some 2.4 million Palestinians live in the densely populated enclave, and almost half have been displaced, according to the UN.
Israel has cut off supplies of water, electricity, fuel and food to the long-blockaded territory.
UN chief Antonio Guterres warned Friday that humanitarian relief stuck in Egypt was ""the difference between life and death for so many people in Gaza."" And World Health Organization emergencies director Michael Ryan said Biden's deal for an initial 20 truck-delivery was ""a drop in the ocean of need"" and that 2,000 trucks were required.  
At least 30 percent of all housing in Gaza has been destroyed or damaged, the UN says, citing local authorities, and thousands have taken refuge in a tent city set up in southern Gaza's Khan Yunis.
Fadwa al-Najjar said she and her seven children walked for 10 hours to reach the camp, at some points breaking into a run as air strikes descended around them.
""We saw bodies and limbs torn off and we just started praying, thinking we were going to die,"" she told AFP.
""I would have preferred not to leave, to have stayed at home and died there,"" her daughter Malak added.
Israel's operation will take not ""a day, nor a week, nor a month,"" the country's defence minister Yoav Gallant warned Friday, and will result in ""the end of Israel's responsibilities in the Gaza Strip"".
An Israeli foreign ministry source, speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, said Israel envisaged ""handing over the keys"" to neighbouring Egypt, which has strongly rejected attempts to place Gaza's residents under its responsibility.
- Peace summit -
""I'm afraid that the current destruction is part of a clear plan for people to have no place left to live,"" said Omar Ashour, a retired general in Gaza.
""This will cause a second Nakba,"" he added, referring to the 760,000 Palestinians who were expelled from or fled their homes when Israel was created.
Israel is strongly backed by international allies and Biden on Friday requested $14 billion in emergency military aid for Israel as part of a massive security spending package that faces a tough battle in the paralysed US Congress.
He argued the money would secure US interests in the region, where there are fears of a wider conflagration.
The United States has moved two aircraft carriers into the eastern Mediterranean to deter Iran or Lebanon's Hezbollah, both Hamas allies, and France said it had directly warned Hezbollah against involvement.  Israel on Friday ordered the 25,000 residents of the northern town of Kiryat Shmona to evacuate.
Debris from an intercepted rocket fell on a school playground in the town on Wednesday, resident Lianne Abutbul told AFP.
""It could have killed children, it's really scary.""
Protests have erupted over the conflict across the region and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will host a peace summit on Saturday attended by regional and some Western leaders.

"Gaza deaths soar as Israel says ""the war will last many more months""","GAZA - The Hamas-run Gaza Strip's health ministry said Wednesday the death toll from the war with Israel now tops 21,000, with a spokesman reporting 195 deaths over 24 hours.
READ: Gaza refugee camp in ruins after Israeli strike
Israel again pounded Gaza with air strikes and shelling after its military chief warned the war raging with Hamas since the Palestinian group's 7 October attacks will last ""many more months"".
Explosions lit up the sky over the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis -- a focus of heavy urban combat since the Israeli army said it had largely gained control over Gaza's north.
A strike hit a house near Al-Amal hospital in Khan Yunis, killing 22 people and wounding 34, the Gaza health ministry said.
Heavy firefights also raged again around Gaza City in the north, while an air strike wounded 11 people near Rafah, a far-southern city crowded with internally displaced people, witnesses said.Gaza's spiralling humanitarian crisis has amplified calls for an end to the hostilities.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to keep up the campaign to destroy Hamas.
""This war's objectives are essential and not simple to achieve,"" armed forces chief Herzi Halevi said Tuesday. ""Therefore, the war will continue for many more months.""
The conflict erupted when Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel, resulting in the deaths of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Palestinian militants also took around 250 hostages, 129 of whom remain in captivity, Israel says.Israel retaliated with a relentless bombardment and a siege of Gaza followed by a ground invasion from 27 October.
The campaign has killed at least 21,110 people, according to the latest toll issued by Gaza's health ministry, about two thirds of them women and children.
Israel's army blames Hamas and its allied armed groups for the high civilian death toll, charging that fighters hide in schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure, or in tunnels below them.
The army said the number of Israeli soldiers killed inside Gaza had risen to 164.An AFP photographer witnessed a digger lowering the human remains in blue body bags into a mass grave in Rafah.
 
- 'Beyond a catastrophe' -
 
Gaza's 2.4 million people have suffered severe shortages of water, food, fuel and medicines, with only limited aid entering the territory. An estimated 1.9 million Gazans have been displaced, the UN says.
AFPTV footage showed Palestinians who had been sheltering in a UN-run school in central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp fleeing south, seeking safety from the bombardment.
Displaced Gazans ""don't know where to go"", said one of them, declining to be named. ""First, we're displaced to Nuseirat, then to Rafah.""
Even schools ""are no longer safe"" in Gaza, said the man.
""A solution must be reached... Implement a ceasefire instead of bringing in aid.""Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, in an interview on Egyptian television, charged that the Gaza war ""goes beyond a catastrophe and a genocide"".
""Netanyahu's plan is to get rid of the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority,"" said Abbas, who is based in the occupied West Bank.
The UN Security Council, in a resolution last week, called for the ""safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale"".
The resolution, which did not call for an immediate end to the fighting, effectively leaves Israel with operational oversight of aid deliveries.
In Rafah, hundreds turned up at the Abdul Salam Yassin water company carrying baskets, pulling handcarts and even pushing a wheelchair stacked with bottles to queue for clean water.""This was my father's cart,"" said Rafah resident Amir al-Zahhar. ""He was martyred during the war. He used it to transport and sell fish, and now we are using it to transport fresh water.""
Elsewhere in Rafah, people split logs and stacked kindling as the lack of fuel forced them to burn wood for cooking and to keep warm.
Internet and telephone services that were cut on Tuesday were gradually being restored in central and southern areas of Gaza, the Palestinian telecommunications company Paltel said on X, formerly Twitter.
 
- Mideast tensions -
 Violence has also flared across the West Bank, with more than 310 Palestinians killed by Israeli troops or settlers since 7 October, the health ministry there said.
An Israeli operation in a refugee camp in the northern West Bank killed six people early Wednesday, it said, with the army saying it had struck the Nur Shams camp from the air.
The war has reverberated across the Middle East, drawing in armed groups backed by Israel's arch foe Iran in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.An Israeli air strike on a Lebanon border town killed a Hezbollah fighter, the group said Wednesday, with state media reporting two of his relatives were also killed.
Hezbollah later Wednesday said it launched a barrage of 30 rockets towards northern Israel ""in response to the enemy's repeated crimes"".
In Syria, an Israeli strike Monday killed Iranian general Razi Moussavi, a senior commander in the Quds Force, the foreign operations arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Iran has vowed to avenge the death of Moussavi, whose body was due to be repatriated for burial after memorial prayers at the Shiite holy sites in Iraq on Wednesday. Yemen's Huthi rebels have repeatedly fired at Israel and at passing cargo ships in the Red Sea in attacks in solidarity with Hamas.
US military forces shot down more than a dozen Huthi attack drones and several missiles, the Pentagon said, reporting no casualties or damage.
Israel's military said Tuesday a fighter jet over the Red Sea had intercepted ""a hostile aerial target that was on its way to Israeli territory"".

Strikes on Gaza's Rafah as US warns of potential 'disaster',"JERUSALEM - Israel conducted fresh strikes on southern Gaza's overcrowded border town of Rafah on Friday, where more than a million displaced Palestinians have sought shelter, with key backer the United States warning of a looming ""disaster"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he has ordered troops to ""prepare to operate"" in Rafah, the last major town in the Gaza Strip Israeli ground troops have yet to enter.
A State Department spokesman said Thursday that the United States did not support an Israeli operation in Rafah, with President Joe Biden later telling reporters he considered Israel's conduct of its war against Hamas to be ""over the top"".
The Israeli military stepped up its air strikes on Rafah Thursday, with witnesses reporting more overnight.
The territory's Hamas-run health ministry said early Friday that more than 100 people were killed during the night, including at least eight in Rafah.
The Palestinian Red Crescent meanwhile said three children had died in a strike on Rafah.
UN chief Antonio Guterres said news of the coming push into the city was ""alarming"", and warned it ""would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare"".
State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said Washington had ""yet to see any evidence of serious planning"" for a Rafah ground operation.
Noting Rafah was also a crucial entry point for humanitarian aid, he added such an assault was ""not something we'd support"".
""To conduct such an operation right now with no planning and little thought... would be a disaster,"" he said.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken conveyed Washington's concerns to Netanyahu directly during talks on Wednesday in Jerusalem, Patel said.
Asked about the war in Gaza at an unrelated press conference Thursday evening, Biden told reporters he was ""of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in Gaza, in the Gaza Strip, has been over the top"".
 
- Little progress on truce -
 
The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas and launched air strikes and a ground offensive that have killed at least 27,840 people, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
Militants also seized around 250 hostages. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza, of whom 29 are believed to have died.
Months of bombardment and siege have given rise to a deepening humanitarian crisis, especially in southern Gaza.
UN rights chief Volker Turk, meanwhile, charged that Israel was committing a ""war crime"" with its reported destruction of buildings to create a ""buffer zone"" along the border inside Gaza. 
Israel's ""extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly, amounts to a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and a war crime"", he said in a statement.
Despite a recent blitz of diplomatic efforts aimed at brokering a truce, Blinken wrapped up his fifth crisis tour of the Middle East since the war started without securing a pause in fighting.
On the ceasefire talks, Blinken insisted he still saw ""space for agreement to be reached"" to halt the fighting and bring home Israeli hostages, even after Netanyahu rejected what he labelled Hamas's ""bizarre demands"".
Egypt was set to host new talks with Qatari and Hamas negotiators in hopes of achieving ""calm"" in Gaza and a prisoner-hostage exchange, an Egyptian official said.
A Gaza-based Palestinian official close to the militant group later told AFP they expected negotiations to be ""difficult"", but said Hamas was ""keen to reach a ceasefire"".
In Riyadh, the foreign ministers of Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan reiterated calls for a ""immediate and complete ceasefire"", as well as ""irreversible"" steps towards the recognition of a Palestinian state during talks on the war in Gaza, Saudi state media reported on Friday.
Two diplomats briefed on preparations for Thursday's meeting told AFP it was intended to promote a unified Arab position on the war.
 
- 'Axis of resistance' -
 
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, whose country backs the ""axis of resistance"" groups aligned against Israel, is expected to travel to Lebanon on Friday.
The Iran-backed axis, which includes Hamas, have stepped up attacks around the Middle East, including in Lebanon, where Hezbollah militants fired a barrage of rockets towards Israel on Thursday.
Earlier Thursday evening, an Israeli drone strike on a car in south Lebanon seriously wounded a Hezbollah commander, sources on both sides of the border said.
On the same day, American forces struck ""four Huthi unmanned surface vessels (USV) and seven mobile anti-ship cruise missiles that were prepared to launch against ships in the Red Sea"", the US Central Command (CENTCOM) reported. A US air strike in Iraq on Wednesday killed a senior commander from a pro-Iran armed group who CENTCOM said was ""responsible for directly planning and participating in attacks on US forces"".
The strike came after Washington last week launched a wave of attacks on Iran-linked targets in Iraq and Syria following the killing of three US troops in neighbouring Jordan.

Israel bombs more Gaza targets as envoys seek truce,"GAZA - The Israeli army said Thursday it bombed scores of targets in the Gaza Strip as diplomats pressed on with efforts to halt the fighting that Hamas says has killed 20,000 people in the Palestinian territory.
United Nations relief chief Martin Griffiths called the surging death toll a ""tragic and shameful milestone"" as the UN Security Council was to again discuss a draft resolution calling for a pause in the bloodiest ever Gaza war.
The army said its aircraft had struck another 230 targets in besieged Gaza over the past day, including a rocket launch site, while ground forces had found weapons inside a school in Jabalia near Gaza City.
Incoming rocket fire set off air raid sirens in southern Israel and Tel Aviv, where police reported falling shrapnel but no casualties so far after the projectiles were intercepted by air defences.
Hamas's military wing announced it had launched the Tel Aviv-bound ""missile barrage in response to the Israeli massacres against civilians"".
The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.The Hamas government's media office said Wednesday at least 20,000 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory, with 8,000 children and 6,200 women among the dead.
In the far-southern city of Rafah, a centre for many internally displaced Palestinians, fireballs and smoke rose after explosions on Wednesday.
""I wish for a complete ceasefire, and to put an end to the series of deaths and suffering,"" said one resident, Kassem Shurrab, 25. ""It's been more than 75 days.""
 
- Truce talks -
 
Hopes that Israel and Hamas could be inching towards another truce and hostage release deal have risen this week as the head of the Palestinian militant group visited Egypt and talks were held in Europe. Mossad director David Barnea held a ""positive meeting"" in Warsaw with CIA chief Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, a source familiar with the talks told AFP.
Qatar-based Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh visited Egypt on Wednesday for talks with the country's intelligence chief Abbas Kamel.
However, the stated positions of Israel and Hamas remain far apart.
A Hamas official told AFP that ""a total ceasefire and a retreat of the Israeli occupation army from the Gaza Strip are a precondition for any serious negotiation"" on a hostage-prisoner swap.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there could be no ceasefire in Gaza before the ""elimination"" of Hamas, which Israel, the United States and some other countries consider a ""terrorist"" organisation.
And US President Joe Biden said of a fresh hostage release deal: ""There's no expectation at this point. But we are pushing it.""Qatar, backed by Egypt and the United States, last month helped broker a first week-long truce that saw 80 Israeli hostages freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
One former hostage, Ofir Engel, 18, returned to Kibbutz Beeri alongside families of other captives and gathered at the burnt remains of their former homes.
""They abused us mentally,"" he recounted of his captivity. ""One of the most difficult moments was when terrorists moved us in complete darkness with lots of booms. 
""I was there. Every moment hostages are there it's dangerous. They have no time. Why do I get to be here and they don't? They have to come back home. Now.""
 
- Tunnel network -
 The UN human rights office in Ramallah said it had received reports that Israeli troops had ""summarily killed"" at least 11 unarmed Palestinian men in a Gaza neighbourhood this week.
The incident ""raises alarm about the possible commission of a war crime"", it said, adding the men were killed in front of their family members in the Al-Rimal area of Gaza City.
An Israeli official rejected the claims as ""nothing but blood libel"" and ""yet another example of the partisan and prejudiced approach against Israel"" by the UN body.
Israel said its troops had uncovered a tunnel network used by Hamas leaders including Yahya Sinwar, the Gaza chief of the militant group.
The military released footage Wednesday it said showed the ""large network"" around Gaza City's Palestine Square linking hideouts and residences.
Israel's army said three soldiers were killed on Wednesday, bringing the death toll of its forces to 137 in the Gaza Strip since ground operations began in late October.
An AFPTV live camera on Wednesday filmed two bombs hitting Rafah, where many of the territory's estimated 1.9 million displaced have fled.
The Hamas health ministry said Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians when houses and a mosque in Rafah were hit. It said later at least 30 more people were killed in an Israeli strike that hit two houses east of Khan Yunis.Crowds swarmed the rubble, digging with shovels and a backhoe to try to free the victims. One blackened body lay under a blue blanket on the blood-soaked ground.
""Enough, enough of this,"" Samar Abu Luli, a woman in Rafah, said after Israeli strikes on the city's Al-Shabura neighbourhood. 
""We have lost everything and we can't take it anymore.""
 
- UN impasse -
 
The UN Security Council was due to try once again Thursday to pass a resolution calling for a halt in fighting after previous efforts to win Washington's backing fell short.The United Arab Emirates is sponsoring a proposed resolution which has already been watered down to secure compromise, according to a draft version seen by AFP.  
It calls for ""the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities"".
The war has sparked fears of regional escalation, with exchanges of fire over the Lebanon border, and missiles from Iran-backed Yemeni rebels disrupting Red Sea shipping.
Israel said Thursday one of its fighter jets and artillery had struck Iran-backed Hezbollah militants overnight in response to incoming fire.
An Israeli strike killed a woman in her eighties in a south Lebanon village early Thursday, Lebanese state media said, with rescuers confirming the death to AFP.

World waits on US as Security Council Gaza resolution stalled,"UNITED NATIONS - The UN Security Council on Thursday will try once again to pass a resolution calling for a halt in fighting between Israel and Hamas after previous efforts to win Washington's backing fell short.
Diplomatic wrangling at United Nations headquarters in Manhattan headquarters -- which caused the vote to be postponed again Wednesday -- has come against a backdrop of deteriorating conditions in Gaza and a mounting death toll.
The United Arab Emirates is sponsoring a draft resolution on the conflict which has already been watered down to secure compromise, according to a draft version seen by AFP.  
It calls for ""the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities.""
Countries ""are engaging at the highest level of diplomacy to reach a text that will have impact on the ground. Diplomacy takes time,"" said the UAE's ambassador Lana Zaki Nusseibeh.""If this fails, then we will continue to keep trying... There is too much suffering on the ground for the council to continue to fail on this.""
Members of the 15-member council have been grappling for days to find common ground on the resolution, a vote on which was pushed back several times since Monday. 
 
- 'Final decision' -
 
Israel, backed by its ally the United States, a veto-wielding permanent Security Council member, has opposed the term ""ceasefire,"" and Washington has used its veto twice to thwart resolutions opposed by Israel since the start of the war.
The latest delay was at the request of the United States, a diplomatic source said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday there would be no ceasefire in Gaza until the ""elimination"" of Hamas.
""Everyone in New York is still waiting on the White House. There is a strong sense that (US President Joe) Biden will make the final decision on this,"" said International Crisis Group analyst Richard Gowan.  
Washington's UN ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield ""has pitched hard within the US system for a deal,"" Gowan said.  
""But if the Israelis continue to oppose the resolution, Biden could still decide to block it.""He said Washington wanted ""to make sure that the resolution, in what it calls for and requires, actually advances (humanitarian) effort and doesn't do anything that could actually hurt the delivery of humanitarian assistance.""
The spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said it is ""not for us to interfere with those discussions, which I understand are fairly intense."" 
""The secretary-general's own position is unchanged -- he's been calling for a humanitarian ceasefire,"" said the spokesman, Stephane Dujarric.

The Israel-Hamas military balance,"GAZA - Israel has one of the best-resourced militaries in the world, hugely supported by Washington. In Hamas, it faces a highly-trained armed group with powerful regional allies.
With both sides poised for a ground offensive in the wake of the deadly attack by Hamas on October 7, here is an overview of their military resources. 
 
- Israel -
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) number 169,500, of which 126,000 are army, according to Britain's International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).
On top of that, it has 400,000 reservists, of which 360,000 have been mobilised since the Hamas attack.
Israel has some of the most technologically advanced defences in the world, including the ""Iron Dome"" anti-missile system. 
IISS says it has some 1,300 tanks and other armoured vehicles, 345 fighter jets and a vast arsenal of artillery, drones and state-of-the-art submarines. 
Though not a declared nuclear state, Israel's nuclear weapons cache is an open secret and the Arms Control Association puts its number of warheads at 90. 
 
- US ally -Washington currently provides $3.8 billion per year to Israel in military aid under a 10-year agreement running until 2028. 
It has delivered increased munitions to Israel and deployed two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean -- the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest warship, and the USS Eisenhower, aimed at deterring not just Hamas but also its allies in Iran and Hezbollah.
British defence analysis firm Janes said US aircraft carriers travel with smaller ships -- destroyers, cruisers, submarines and support vessels –- that offer a multitude of capabilities including ballistic missile protection, command-and-control, humanitarian assistance, evacuation and disaster relief.
""Another aircraft carrier adds another 95,000 tons of power projection to the point that the United States is making,"" said Janes expert Nick Brown. 
 
- Hamas -
Hamas has a diverse arsenal built up over many years. 
Its armed forces, under the name Al-Qassam Brigades, numbers 15,000 men according to IISS, though it notes Arabic media have put the figure at 40,000.
They have heavy weapons sourced from across the Middle East -- particularly Iran, Syria and Libya -- and has also sourced handguns and assault rifles from China and other regions. 
It also has a variety of locally-made, improvised explosives and Western sources say enough drones, mines, anti-tank guided missiles, grenade launchers and mortar shells to hold out for a long period, though precise figures are unavailable. 
The majority of its rockets are also locally manufactured and technologically rudimentary. 
 
- Hezbollah -
There have already been exchanges across the border between Israel and Lebanon, where the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah is based. ""Hezbollah can tie up IDF resources without having to fully commit to the fight, instead relying on occasional rocket or missile strikes to prevent the Israelis from growing complacent and forcing the IDF to commit manpower and materiel along the northern border,"" said the Soufan Center, a US think tank.
In 2021, the group claimed to have 100,000 fighters. The Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), an Israeli think tank, says the number is half that. 
Independent Middle East expert Eva Koulouriotis estimates Hezbollah has 20,000 highly trained fighters and a reserve of some 50,000 who have received three months of training in Lebanon and three months in Iran.
INSS says the group's arsenal counts between 150,000 and 200,000 rockets and missiles, including ""hundreds"" of precision rockets. 
Hezbollah simulated cross-border raids into Israel in May that involved weapons systems from Iran, Syria, Russia and China. 
 
- Iran -
Since its Islamic revolution in 1979, Iran has made support for Palestinians one of the pillars of its ideology. 
Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian warned in recent days: ""No one can guarantee the control of the situation and the non-expansion of the conflicts"" if Israel sends its soldiers into Gaza.
Raz Zimmt, of INSS, said Iran currently had ""no interest in Hezbollah engaging in an all-out war"" that might threaten such a key ""strategic asset"". 
But he added that Iran's hand could be forced by ""an Israeli ground invasion, and especially Israeli military success, which will threaten the very survival of Hamas and/or its ability to maintain effective control over the Gaza Strip.""

Gaza beekeeper tends hives by restive border,"JABALIA - In a field close to the Gaza Strip's restive frontier, apiarist Miassar Khoudair checks that her queen bee has survived five days of deadly cross-border fire between Palestinian militants and the Israeli army.
""The bees die from the gases, the rockets and dust as a result of the war,"" said the 29-year-old, dressed in a protective white bee suit.
Ahead of World Bee Day on Saturday -- which aims to raise the profile of these vital pollinators -- Khoudair has returned to her colony just a few hundred metres (yards) from the border.
In the latest escalation in hostilities between Israel and Gaza's militant groups, Khoudair was unable to access the hives amid outgoing Palestinian rocket fire and incoming Israeli airstrikes, with three or four of the apiaries destroyed.
The fighting, which began after Israeli strikes killed top militants from the Islamic Jihad group whom Israel says were responsible for attacks against its citizens, saw 33 people killed in Gaza and two in Israel, including a labourer from the Palestinian enclave, medics said.
Beyond the grass and trees surrounding Khoudair's hives, a flag of Islamic Jihad, whose fighters launched volleys of rockets toward Israel during the conflict, flies in an adjacent field.
Despite the dangers, the frontier's farmland offers some of the only areas in Gaza's densely-populated urban environment suitable for beekeeping.
""We always put them in border areas, because there are lots of trees and wild plants, and there aren't many buildings or overcrowding,"" she said.
The territory is home to some 2.3 million people, who have endured an Israeli-led blockade since the Islamist militant group Hamas took power in the territory in 2007.Cross-border trade was halted until a ceasefire on Saturday took hold and the fighting also damaged an estimated 600 dunams (0.6 square kilometres or 0.2 square miles) of crops.
The value of losses to beehives, poultry farms and livestock reached $225,000, according to the Hamas-run government's media office.

- 'I rely on myself' -

The conflict halted daily life and prevented Khoudair from selling honey at her store in a usually buzzing mall in downtown Gaza City.
Khoudair studied herbal medicine and as well as selling traditional eating honey, she also sells honey-based infusions to treat everything from problems of concentration to fertility issues.
""If the honey's of high quality, it's very treatable. There are some mixtures added to the honey, and here it treats childbearing,"" she said, without elaborating.
Khoudair started her business a few months ago after studying honey and herbal medicine in Saudi Arabia, she said.
""While I was in Saudi, I found they have the idea of honey, their love for honey, their interest in honey, as a remedy and a supplement on the table to my lunch,"" she said.With 45 percent unemployment in Gaza, according to the International Monetary Fund, Khoudair's bees provide her with a job.
""It's a very beneficial project, and I rely on myself as a woman,"" she said.
Standing beside her colony after inspecting her hives -- resulting in a few stings to her hands -- Khoudair urged people beyond Gaza's borders to ""care about the bees' produce"".
""Honey was mentioned in the Quran, we take it therapeutically, not just in a nutritional way, and it's healthy and strengthened with vitamins,"" she said, above the drone of her bees.

"Gaza death toll nears 30,000 as UN warns of 'imminent' famine","Fighting raged Wednesday in the Gaza Strip, where the reported death toll in the almost five-month Israel-Hamas war neared 30,000 as mediators insisted a truce could be just days away.
The Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry reported another 91 deaths in overnight Israeli bombardment, while UN agencies sounded the alarm on dire humanitarian conditions and looming famine in Gaza's north.
Mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been seeking a six-week pause in the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which in response vowed to eliminate the Palestinian Islamist group that rules in Gaza.
While Israel's plans for post-war Gaza exclude any mention of the Palestinian Authority, its top ally the United States and other powers have called for a revitalised PA to take charge of the territory as well as occupied the West Bank.
On Wednesday, Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki said a ""technocratic"" Palestinian government without Gaza's rulers Hamas was needed to ""stop this insane war"" and facilitate relief operations and reconstruction.His government, based in the West Bank, resigned this week, with prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh citing the need for change after the war ends.
""The time now is not for a national coalition government"" that may include Hamas and president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party, which controls the PA, he said.
A government that includes Hamas would ""be boycotted by a number of countries, as happened before,"" Maliki told a news conference in Geneva.
""Hamas should understand this, and I do believe that they are in support of the idea to establish, today, a technocratic government"" for a period of ""transition"", he said.After a flurry of diplomacy, mediators said a truce deal could finally be within reach -- reportedly including the release of some Israeli hostages held in Gaza since Hamas's October 7 attack in exchange for several hundred Palestinian detainees held by Israel.
The Israeli military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 29,954 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest health ministry figures.
It was launched in response to Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of around 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
 
- Soaring prices -
Qatar was ""hopeful, not necessarily optimistic, that we can announce something"" before Thursday, foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said.
His remarks came after US President Joe Biden expressed hopes that ""by next Monday we'll have a ceasefire"", but, he added, ""we're not done yet"".Doha has suggested the pause in fighting would come before the beginning of Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month which starts on March 10 or 11, depending on the lunar calendar.
Short of the complete withdrawal Hamas has called for, a source from the group said the deal might see Israeli forces leave ""cities and populated areas"", allowing the return of some displaced Palestinians and humanitarian relief.
In a sign of growing desperation among Gazans over living conditions, a rare protest was held Wednesday in the far-southern city of Rafah, packed with nearly 1.5 million Palestinians -- many of them displaced by the fighting.
""The situation is very difficult in Gaza. We can't afford things,"" said Rafah resident Abdulrahman Abu Khuder at the rally over soaring prices of basic commodities.The Hamas government should ""interfere"" to ensure ordinary Palestinians have basic supplies, he said, but ""they don't care"".
While hundreds of thousands of Gazans have fled south since the start of the war, those who remain in the territory's north have faced an increasingly desperate situation, aid groups have warned.
 
- 'Almost inevitable' starvation - 
""If nothing changes, a famine is imminent in northern Gaza,"" the World Food Programme's deputy executive director Carl Skau told the UN Security Council Tuesday.His colleague from the UN humanitarian office OCHA, Ramesh Rajasingham, warned of ""almost inevitable"" widespread starvation.
The WFP said no humanitarian group had been able to deliver aid to the north for more than a month, accusing Israel of blocking access.
Most aid trucks have been halted, but foreign militaries have air dropped supplies over southern Gaza.
What aid does enter Gaza passes through the Rafah, where Israel has warned it plans to launch a ground offensive, potentially only after a truce.
Israel has insisted it would move civilians to safety before sending troops into the area on Gaza's border with Egypt, which has warned an assault on Rafah would have ""catastrophic repercussions"".
An AFP correspondent reported that overnight several air strikes hit the Rafah area as well as southern Gaza's main city Khan Yunis and Zeitun further north.In Israel, Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure to bring the hostages home.
Gaza militants on October 7 took about 250 captives, 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 31 presumed dead, according to Israel.

Israeli strikes destroy 'hundreds' of Gaza buildings: rescuers,"GAZA - Israel's army relentlessly hammered Gaza on Saturday after fierce overnight bombardment that rescuers said destroyed hundreds of buildings three weeks into a war sparked by the deadliest attack in the country's history.
READ: Hamas says Israeli strikes killed hostages
The United Nations warned thousands more civilians could die as Israel escalated ground operations, while the families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas said the government snubbed them when asking about the captives' fate.
Israel unleashed its bombing campaign after Hamas gunmen stormed across the Gaza border on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and seizing more than 220 hostages, according to Israeli officials.The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Israeli strikes had killed 7,703 people, mainly civilians, with more than 3,500 of them children.
The conflict is the fifth and deadliest in Gaza since Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Palestinian territory in 2005.
UN human rights chief Volker Turk warned of ""the possibly catastrophic consequences of large-scale ground operations in Gaza,"" saying ""thousands more civilians"" could die.
""When these hostilities end, those who have survived will face the rubble of their homes and the graves of their family members,"" Turk said.
The intense Israeli strikes against Hamas, the Islamist group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, coincided with ground operations and came as tens of thousands of troops massed along the Gaza border ahead of an expected full-blown invasion.
Israeli forces had also made limited ground incursions on Wednesday and Thursday.""Hundreds of buildings and houses were completely destroyed and thousands of other homes were damaged,"" said Gaza Civil Defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal.
The intense bombardment had ""changed the landscape"" of northern Gaza, he told AFP.
Witnesses said most of the bombing was concentrated in the Jabaliya district of northern Gaza.
The strikes left wide craters in the streets and flattened many buildings in the area.
 
- 'Death is everywhere' -
 
Hundreds of Hamas fighters crossed the Israeli border in vehicles, by air and sea on October 7, indiscriminately killing civilians in the streets, in their homes and at an outdoor rave party.The unprecedented attack caught Israel off guard and exposed serious intelligence failings.
""The army entered the Gaza Strip and extended its operations"" with tanks and artillery, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Saturday.
Israeli fighter jets hit 150 ""terror tunnels, underground combat spaces and additional underground infrastructure"" and ""several Hamas terrorists were killed"", the army said.
Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it targeted Israeli forces in an area of northern Gaza near the border on Saturday.
Israeli warplanes flew overhead and successive booms could be heard coming from Gaza, AFP journalists reported.A thick haze of smoke covered Gaza and southern Israel after the night of heavy bombardment.
""There are a large number of martyrs and a large number of survivors under the rubble, and we cannot reach them,"" a Gaza civil defence official said.
""The stench of death is everywhere, in every neighbourhood, every street and every house,"" respiratory physician Raed al-Astal told AFP from Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.
 
- 'Profound fear' -
 
The families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas demanded on Saturday an immediate government explanation about their fate after the army's intensified strikes.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents some 229 people believed abducted by Hamas, said the war cabinet had failed to explain to relatives whether the ground operation endangered the captives' well-being.On Thursday, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades said ""almost 50"" hostages had been killed in Israeli bombing since October 7. AFP could not immediately verify the figure.
In Tel Aviv, Yael Leviel said reading about the Israeli operations offered ""support and strength"" as ""all of us continue to live in profound fear"".
""We cannot afford to lower our guard... our very existence is at stake,"" the 50-year-old social worker told AFP.
 
- Communications blackout -
 
Hamas said all internet connections and communications across Gaza had been cut.
AFP journalists in Gaza confirmed they were only able to communicate in limited areas where they could connect to Israeli networks across the border.Human Rights Watch warned the near-total telecommunications blackout in Gaza risked providing cover for ""mass atrocities"".
The Palestinian Red Crescent said the outage had disrupted ambulance services.
The UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Lynne Hastings, said on X, formerly Twitter, that ""hospitals & humanitarian operations can't continue without communications"".
Between the bombardments and the fuel shortages, 12 of Gaza's 35 hospitals have been forced to close.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said it has had to ""significantly reduce its operations"".
Israel's military accused Hamas of using hospitals in Gaza as operations centres for directing attacks, which Hamas denied.
 
- 'Stop this madness' -
 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said ""Israel must immediately stop this madness and end its attacks"" in a post on X on Saturday, after the UN General Assembly called for an ""immediate humanitarian truce"" in Gaza.The non-binding resolution on Friday received overwhelming support, but Israel and the United States criticised it for failing to mention Hamas.
Israel's bombardment has displaced more than 1.4 million people inside Gaza, according to the UN, while supplies of food, water and power to the crowded territory have been almost completely cut off.
Israel has blocked all deliveries of fuel, saying it would be exploited by Hamas to manufacture weapons and explosives.
A first tranche of aid was allowed on October 21, but only 84 have crossed in total, according to the UN, which says a daily average of 500 trucks had entered Gaza before the conflict.
UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said Gazans were ""not only dying from bombs and strikes, soon many more will die from the consequences of (the) siege"".Violence has also risen sharply in the occupied West Bank since the October 7 attacks, with more than 100 Palestinians killed and nearly 2,000 wounded, according to the UN.

Gaza medic says 50 killed rushing to aid trucks,"An emergency doctor in Gaza on Thursday said Israeli forces shot dead 50 people who rushed towards aid trucks, adding to a Palestinian toll that the health ministry said topped 30,000 in nearly five months of war.
The Israeli army said it was checking reports of the incident, which came as aid agencies intensified warnings over Gaza's humanitarian situation, with famine threatening.
Facing what humanitarians describe as an increasingly dire situation on the ground, mediators say a truce deal between Israel and Hamas militants could be just days away.
In a reflection of increased concern at the White House, US President Joe Biden's administration is considering air-dropping aid into Gaza, US news site Axios reported early Thursday.
Amjad Aliwa, director of the emergency department of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, said ""the number of martyrs rose to at least 50"".
He said they died as a result of ""the occupation's shooting"" at the crowd as aid trucks brought desperately needed food into the city.Earlier, the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said children have died ""due to malnutrition, dehydration and widespread famine"" at Al-Shifa hospital. 
US Agency for International Development head Samantha Power said Israel needed to open more crossings so that ""vitally needed humanitarian assistance can be dramatically surged"".
On social media platform X, she called it ""a matter of life and death"".
Before the Gaza City incident the health ministry had reported at least 79 people killed overnight Wednesday-Thursday, pushing the war's death toll in the territory above 30,000.
World Health Organization (WFP) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledged the 30,000 figure in a post on X and said: ""This horrific violence and suffering must end. Ceasefire.""
 
- Towards 'the finish line' -
The war was triggered by an unprecedented Hamas attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of around 1,160 people, mostly civilians, Israeli figures show.
After the attack, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas which has ruled Gaza since 2007. Israel's military says 242 soldiers have died in Gaza since ground operations began in late October.New Zealand on Thursday became one of the latest Western countries to designate all of Hamas as a ""terrorist"" entity. Wellington said the October 7 attack shattered the notion that the movement's political and military wings are separate.
Mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been seeking a six-week pause in the war.
Negotiators are hoping a truce can begin by around March 10 or 11 when the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins, depending on the lunar calendar. 
The proposals reportedly include the release of some Israeli hostages held in Gaza by militants in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
Short of the complete withdrawal Hamas has called for, a source from the group said the deal might see Israeli forces leave ""cities and populated areas"", allowing the return of some displaced Palestinians and humanitarian relief.
US President Joe Biden is ""pushing all of us to try to get this agreement over the finish line"", Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.
 
- Famine 'imminent' -
The United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA described the food security situation as ""extremely critical across Gaza, particularly in northern Gaza.""
According to WFP, no humanitarian group had been able to deliver aid to the north for more than a month. The agency accused Israel of blocking access. ""If nothing changes, a famine is imminent in northern Gaza,"" WFP's deputy executive director Carl Skau said.
Israeli officials have denied blocking supplies.
Neighbouring Jordan has already air-dropped food and other aid into Gaza, and Egypt's defence ministry released footage of a similar mission. Canada is also looking at partnering with ""like-minded countries"" such as Jordan to air-drop aid, Canadian media reported.
Nearly 1.5 million people trying to flee the fighting are now packed into Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, where Israel is threatening to send in troops against Hamas fighters there.
""They are 30,000 martyrs. I don't know what the Jews (Israel) want from us, and why they killed this number. It is a genocide,"" said Jihad Salha, one of the displaced in Rafah.
Intense fighting has taken place in Khan Yunis city a few kilometres (miles) from Rafah.On Thursday Israel's military said it had also killed militants in central Gaza as well as in Gaza City's Zeitun area.
""Three terrorists that used drones were identified entering a compound in the area, where they were eliminated"" by an air strike, the military said.
While fighting continued, Muhammad Yassin, 35, battled to find flour in Zeitun.
""I found thousands of people waiting for long hours just to get a kilo or two kilos of flour,"" he said. ""We have not eaten a loaf of bread for two months. Our children are starving.""
 
 
- Meeting in Moscow -
Talk about Gaza's post-war future has intensified even as combat continues.
Israel's plans exclude any mention of the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. But its top ally the United States and other powers have called for a revitalised PA to take charge of the territory when the war ends.
Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki, whose administration resigned this week, said a ""technocratic"" government without Hamas was needed.On Thursday, Palestinian factions -- including Hamas and rival Fatah -- were expected in Moscow for a meeting at Russia's invitation.
Israel says 130 hostages captured by militants remain in Gaza, including 31 presumed dead. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- who leads a coalition which includes religious and ultra-nationalist parties -- has come under increasing pressure to bring the captives home.
A group of 150 Israelis started a four-day march from Reim, near the Gaza border, to Jerusalem, calling for the government to reach a deal.
In another reflection of political tensions within Israel, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant called for members of the ultra-Orthodox community to be enrolled in military service.",Thursday 29 February 2024 - 13:40pm
Israel bombs south Gaza as Hamas officials due in Cairo for truce talks," 
JERUSALEM - Egypt is due to host Friday a high-level Hamas delegation for talks aimed at putting an end to the nearly 12-week war with Israel that has devastated the Gaza Strip.
The Cairo meeting comes as fighting -- triggered by Hamas's deadly October 7 attack on Israel -- rages in the besieged Palestinian territory's south and centre.
Israeli shelling near a southern Gaza hospital has killed 41 people over the past two days, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on Thursday.
The casualties in repeated Israeli strikes near the Al-Amal hospital in Khan Yunis include ""displaced persons seeking shelter"", the Red Crescent said in a statement.
The UN humanitarian office said an estimated 100,000 more displaced people had arrived in the already-teeming southern border city of Rafah in recent days following the intensification of fighting around Deir al-Balah and Khan Yunis.
The Israeli military on Friday said its forces ""are extending operation in Khan Yunis"" and had ""eliminated dozens of terrorists"" across Gaza over the past 24 hours.AFPTV footage showed smoke billowing over Rafah, near Egypt, following fresh strikes early Friday.
The health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said on Thursday Israeli shelling had killed 20 people, most of them women and children, at the Shaboura camp in Rafah.
The Gaza fighting left much of the territory's north in ruins, while the battlefront has shifted ever further to the south and raised tensions across the Middle East.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas -- dubbed a ""terrorist"" group by the United States and European Union --- in retaliation for the October attack which left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Around 250 hostages were also taken during the attack, more than half of whom remain captive.The Israeli army says 168 of its soldiers have been killed inside Gaza.
Sources close to Hamas say Egypt's three-stage plan provides for renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and ultimately an end to the war.
 
- Aid corridor -
 
The Israeli army has said it had deployed an additional brigade to Khan Yunis, hometown of Hamas's Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, and AFP correspondents reported sustained air and artillery strikes.""The missions that our forces are carrying out in Khan Yunis are unprecedented... taking over control rooms and eliminating terrorists,"" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told soldiers on Thursday.
Israel has repeatedly said that one of the chief goals of the war is the return of the 129 hostages it says remain in Gaza.
On Thursday, an Israeli kibbutz community said one of its residents, US-Israeli Judith Weinstein Haggai who was thought to be the oldest woman held captive had in fact died in the October 7 attack and her body held by militants.US President Joe Biden said he was ""devastated"" by the news of the 70-year-old woman's death, pledging that Washington would ""not stop working"" with its ally Israel to bring the remaining hostages home.
In Gaza, the UN says more than 80 percent of the narrow coastal territory's 2.4 million people have been driven from their homes. Many now live in cramped shelters or makeshift tents around Rafah.
Residents in Rafah combed through rubble for survivors on Thursday after an air strike that one witness said left ""several casualties"". 
Tayseer Abu al-Eish said he was at home when ""all of a sudden we heard a loud explosion and debris started falling on us. The apartment was completely destroyed and my daughters were screaming"".
An Israeli siege imposed after October 7, following years of crippling blockade, has deprived Gazans of food, water, fuel and medicine.The severe shortages have been only sporadically eased by humanitarian aid convoys entering primarily via Egypt. 
Israel said Thursday it had given preliminary approval to the Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus for a ""maritime lifeline"" to ship aid to Gaza.
 
- 'Complete withdrawal' -
 
A Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP the delegation in Cairo would ""give the response of the Palestinian factions, including several observations"" regarding the Egyptian proposal, recently put to officials from Hamas and another Gaza armed group, Islamic Jihad.
Hamas would also seek ""guarantees for a complete Israeli military withdrawal"" from Gaza, the official said.The proposal provides for a Palestinian government of technocrats after talks involving ""all Palestinian factions"", which would be responsible for governing and rebuilding in post-war Gaza.
Diaa Rashwan, who heads Egypt's State Information Services, said the plan was ""intended to bring together the views of all parties concerned, with the aim of ending the shedding of Palestinian blood"".
In Israel, a rally Thursday calling for a ceasefire drew hundreds of protesters to a central square in the coastal city of Tel Aviv.
""Israelis, Palestinians, Muslims, Jews, Christians -- this is everybody's home,"" said protester Itay Eyal, a 51-year-old teacher.
""The only solution is to recognise that both peoples are entitled to life, freedom, sovereignty and dignity.""Israel has traded heavy cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah since the Gaza war erupted, and on Friday said its military had struck ""Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon"" after reporting rocket fire from there.

Cyprus says second aid ship ready to leave for Gaza,"A second ship loaded with aid for Gaza could depart as early as Saturday, Cyprus said, as the first vessel returned from the war-ravaged territory after successfully delivering its cargo. 
The Jennifer was set ""to depart for Gaza today or tomorrow,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Theodoros Gotsis told state radio.
US charity World Central Kitchen said the Jennifer had been loaded with 240 tonnes of food but that rough weather made it hard to predict when it would set sail for Gaza or when the first vessel, the Open Arms, might make a return trip.
""Maritime weather reports show bad weather from Sunday until end of next week —- so exact timing of sailing for either boat to return to Gaza is not available at this time,"" the charity said in a statement.
The maritime aid corridor from Cyprus is meant to at least partly address stark shortages in Gaza after more than five months of war, as UN agencies warn of looming famine.
Earlier on Saturday, World Central Kitchen said its team had finished unloading food and other desperately needed supplies from the barge towed by Spanish aid vessel Open Arms, which left Cyprus on Tuesday in a trial run for the aid corridor.
""All cargo was offloaded and is being readied for distribution in Gaza,"" World Central Kitchen said in a statement, noting it included ""almost 200 tonnes of food"".
The cargo on the Jennifer includes ""pallets of canned goods and bulk product -- including beans, carrots, canned tuna, chickpeas, canned corn, parboiled rice, flour, oil and salt,"" the charity said.
It also includes a forklift and a crane to assist with deliveries, it said.
The United Arab Emirates has sent ""a special load of 120 (kilogrammes of) fresh dates,"" it added.
Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides told reporters that Open Arms ""has begun to return"" to Cyprus ""and we are ready to send the second ship with humanitarian aid to Gaza.""
The Spanish charity that owns the first vessel, also named Open Arms, said it would get back to Cyprus on Sunday and could participate in future aid deliveries.
- A first 'test' -
With the humanitarian situation in Gaza increasingly dire, donors have pursued alternatives including airdrops and maritime shipments.
World Central Kitchen built a makeshift jetty southwest of Gaza City to receive Friday's shipment but US troops are on their way to build a larger pier.
The Israeli military said troops had secured the area around the jetty while the Open Arms shipment was unloaded. It said it had inspected the cargo before delivery.
World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres said on X that the first shipment was ""a test"" and that ""we could bring thousands of tonnes each week.""
The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 31,553 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.",Saturday 16 March 2024 - 19:25pm
Entire Gaza population at 'severe levels of acute food insecurity': Blinken,"USA - The entire population of Gaza is experiencing ""severe levels of acute food insecurity"", US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday, underscoring the urgency for increasing the delivery of humanitarian aid into the Palestinian territory.
""According to the most respected measure of these things, 100 percent of the population in Gaza is at severe levels of acute food insecurity. That's the first time an entire population has been so classified,"" Blinken told a press conference in the Philippines where he is on an official visit.
Blinken's remarks came on the eve of his return to the Middle East, this time to Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to discuss efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and ramp up aid deliveries.
A United Nations-backed food security assessment warned Monday that half of Gazans are experiencing ""catastrophic"" hunger, with famine projected to hit the north of the territory by May unless there is urgent intervention.
Martin Griffiths, the UN's humanitarian chief, has called for Israel to allow unfettered aid into the besieged Palestinian territory, saying there was ""no time to lose"".
The bloodiest-ever Gaza war broke out after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7. 
Israel responded with a relentless bombing campaign and ground offensive in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.
With aid agencies reporting huge difficulties gaining access to Gaza, particularly the north, the UN has warned for weeks that a famine is looming.
Donors have turned to deliveries by air or sea, but these are not viable alternatives to land deliveries, UN agencies say.
The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification partnership said Monday that while the technical criteria for a famine had not yet been met, ""all evidence points towards a major acceleration of deaths and malnutrition"". 
Citing UN data, Blinken said 100 percent of the population in Gaza needed humanitarian assistance, compared with 80 percent in Sudan and 70 percent in Afghanistan. 
""This only underscores both the urgency, the imperative, of making this the priority,"" Blinken said of aid deliveries.
""We need more, we need it to be sustained, and we need it to be a priority if we're going to effectively address the needs of people.""
Blinken is in Manila as part of a brief Asia tour aimed at reinforcing US support for regional allies against China.
During a joint press conference with his Philippine counterpart, Blinken was asked about steps he was taking to address the lack of access to Gaza for foreign journalists.
""There are obviously profound security considerations in an active war zone and those have to be taken into account,"" Blinken said.
""But the basic principle of access for journalists is something we stand strongly behind.""",Tuesday 19 March 2024 - 11:00am
China prepares for summit under shadow of Israel-Gaza war," 
BEIJING - China prepared on Monday to host representatives of 130 countries for a forum that will be overshadowed by the Israel-Gaza war, as an increasingly assertive Beijing is asked to help de-escalate the violence.
At the top of the invite list to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) forum is Russia's President Vladimir Putin, on his first trip to a major global power since the Ukraine invasion threw his regime into international isolation.
Leaders have begun to trickle into the Chinese capital for a gala event marking a decade of the BRI -- a key project of President Xi Jinping to extend China's global reach.
While China hopes the forum will help boost its standing as a leading global power, Israel's war with Palestinian militant organisation Hamas will continue to dominate the headlines.
Israel declared war on the Islamist group after waves of its fighters broke through the heavily fortified border on October 7, shooting, stabbing and burning to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
Under heavy Israeli bombardment of the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, more than one million people have fled their homes in scenes of chaos and despair.
Israel's bombing has left at least 2,670 people dead in Gaza, mainly civilians, and flattened entire neighbourhoods.
China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has condemned Israel's actions for going ""beyond the scope of self-defence"" and called for it to ""cease its collective punishment of the people of Gaza"".
""(Israel) should listen earnestly to the calls of the international community and the UN secretary general, and cease its collective punishment of the people of Gaza,"" Wang said Sunday, in what is the strongest stance China has expressed so far on the conflict.
Beijing has been criticised by Western officials for not specifically naming Hamas in its statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict.
Wang had on Sunday spoken with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who called on China to use its ""influence"" in the Middle East to push for calm.
China has a warm relationship with Iran, whose clerical leadership supports both Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group that could open a second front against Israel.
Earlier this year, China brokered an entente between former regional foes Iran and Saudi Arabia. 
Beijing's special envoy Zhai Jun will visit the Middle East this week to push for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict and promote peace talks, China's state broadcaster CCTV said on Sunday, without specifying which countries he would visit.
Niva Yau, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told AFP the BRI summit would allow Beijing to frame attendance as a gesture of support for its position.
""Any head of state that attends the summit, it's almost as if they agree with Beijing's positions on these global issues,"" she said.
 
- Strategic dependence -
 
A number of leaders have already arrived in Beijing ahead of the two-day forum, which kicks off Tuesday.
Among them are Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Kenyan President William Ruto and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.
On Monday Russia's top diplomat Sergei Lavrov flew into Beijing and within hours held talks with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
Putin -- whose strategic dependence on China has only grown since his invasion of neighbouring Ukraine thrust his country into international isolation -- is expected to arrive overnight.
This year, trade between China and Russia has soared to levels not seen since the beginning of Moscow's war in Ukraine, with Chinese imports of Russian oil offering Moscow a critical lifeline as international sanctions bite.
China has refused to condemn the Ukraine war in an effort to position itself as a neutral party, while at the same time offering Moscow vital diplomatic and financial support.
At the heart of the deepening partnership is the relationship between Xi and Putin, who have described each other as ""dear friends"".
Their alliance is also forged by a symbiotic necessity, each seeing the other as a necessary bulwark in their shared struggle against Western dominance. 
In an interview with Chinese state broadcaster CGTN ahead of his visit this week, Putin hailed ties with Beijing and the ""mutual benefits"" of the BRI.
""President Putin pointed out that a multipolar world is taking shape, and the concepts and initiatives put forward by President Xi Jinping are highly relevant and significant,"" CGTN reported.
""He stated that President Xi Jinping is a well-recognised leader on the world stage and is a true world leader,"" it said.
Putin also reportedly ""shared pleasant memories between President Xi and him, and hoped tradition continues when they meet in China in the future.""

"As Gaza deaths top 25,000, Hamas defends attacks that sparked war","JERUSALEM - Palestinian militant group Hamas on Sunday defended its October 7 attacks against Israel but admitted to ""faults"" and called for an end to ""Israeli aggression"" in Gaza, where the health ministry said the death toll passed 25,000.
Southern Gaza is the latest focus of Israel's battle to destroy the Islamist group responsible for the deadliest attack in the country's history.
In its first public report on the attacks that began the war, Hamas said they were a ""necessary step"" against Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, and a way to secure release of Palestinian prisoners.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later vowed ""complete victory"" and said his government would not accept Hamas's conditions for releasing hostages still held in Gaza.Hamas's 16-page report admitted ""some faults happened... due to the rapid collapse of the Israeli security and military system, and the chaos caused along the border areas"".
The war began when gunmen broke through Gaza's militarised border to attack Israelis and foreigners in the streets, in their homes and at an outdoor rave party.
This resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Accounts of sexual violence emerged but the scarcity of survivor testimonies and a lack of forensic evidence made it difficult to assess their scale.
Militants seized about 250 hostages during the attacks, and Israel says around 132 remain in Gaza.
 
- Dead hostages -
 The army announced the death of another soldier in the October 7 attacks and said his body remains in Gaza.
This brings to 28 the number of dead captives still in the Palestinian territory, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli data.
Hamas -- considered a ""terrorist"" group by the United States and European Union -- said in the report that its fighters were committed to ""Islamic values"", and if civilians were targeted ""it happened accidently and in the course of the confrontation with the occupation forces.""
It called for Israel to be held ""legally accountable"" for Palestinian suffering and urged ""popular pressure around the world until ending the occupation"".
In response to the attacks, Israel launched a military offensive that has killed at least 25,105 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
Netanyahu is under intense pressure to return the hostages and account for security failings surrounding the October 7 attacks.Relatives and supporters of the hostages on Sunday again rallied for their return home, near Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem.
In a video statement released after the Hamas report, Netanyahu said that ""in exchange for the release of our hostages, Hamas demands an end to the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza"", the release of Palestinian prisoners and guarantees that Hamas would stay in power.
""If we accept this, our soldiers have fallen in vain,"" and security would not be guaranteed, Netanyahu said. 
United Nations agencies have warned of famine and disease as Gazans, 1.7 million of whom are displaced, struggle with shortages of water, medical care and other essentials during daily bombardment.
 
- Donkey carts -
 
With fuel scarce, they have increasingly turned to donkey carts for transport.""Anyone who used to own a car now uses a donkey. Even businessmen or officials try to collect money just to buy a donkey,"" said Badr al-Akhras, a trader of the beasts.
Diplomatic efforts have sought scaled-up aid deliveries for Gaza, and a truce, after a week-long cessation of hostilities in November saw Hamas release dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
On Sunday 260 humanitarian aid trucks were transferred to Gaza, according to COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs.
On Friday the UN reported 288 trucks had entered, but the figures are far below pre-war levels.
Hamas's Qatar-based chief Ismail Haniyeh met with Turkey's foreign minister to discuss the conflict and humanitarian aid, diplomatic sources said on Sunday.The United States, Arab countries and other governments are seeking a solution involving Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu has rejected it, saying ""Israel must retain security control over Gaza"".
The Hamas report rejected any international and Israeli efforts to decide Gaza's post-war future.
The war has spurred fears of a wider escalation, with Israel's northern border with Lebanon seeing near-daily exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.
An Israeli strike Sunday on south Lebanon killed a Hezbollah fighter, a source close to the group told AFP, with a security official describing the target as a high-level commander who survived.
Israel said its warplanes again bombed Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.Dozens of such attacks in Iraq and Syria have occurred since mid-October. Most have been claimed by Iran-linked militants opposing US support for Israel, but the use of ballistic missiles marked an escalation.

Israel and Gaza at war after Hamas launches surprise attack
On Saturday, Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a wave of rocket attacks and sent fighters into Israel in the biggest escalation in decades.
Israel responded with air strikes in Gaza.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the country that they are entering a ""long and difficult war.""
The Israeli government said it would cut off electricity, fuel and goods supplies to Gaza.
Hundreds are reported to be dead on both sides, with reports that a number of Israeli civilians and soldiers are being held hostage.
The Israeli army has asked residents of several areas of the Gaza Strip to flee their homes in preparation for revenge attacks against Hamas.

Israel bombs Gaza as UN weighs new ceasefire call,"GAZA - Israel carried out more deadly strikes on Gaza Tuesday ahead of an expected UN Security Council vote on another ceasefire appeal, as concern mounted over the war's impact on global shipping.  
One of Israel's enemies, Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels, have repeatedly attacked cargo ships in the Red Sea, leading major firms to divert their vessels and the United States to announce an international naval coalition to protect them. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin -- who on Monday pledged ""ironclad"" US support for Israel -- joined an online conference on the coalition set to include warships from Britain, France, Italy, Spain and other countries.
A top Huthi official later Tuesday said any country that acts against the rebels ""will have its ships targeted in the Red Sea"".
Israel maintained its bombardment and ground combat Tuesday in the third month of the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, which started with unprecedented attacks by Hamas against Israel on October 7.The militants burst through the militarised Gaza border fence, killed around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and abducted about 250, according to the latest Israeli figures.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says Israel's withering military response has killed more than 19,667 people, mostly women and children.
The UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million residents are displaced.
Homes have been destroyed, forcing many into overcrowded shelters as they struggle to find cooking fuel, food, water and medical care.
With power and communication cuts, Gazans are returning to time-worn traditions including battery-powered radio sets to get news of the war.
""Here in Gaza we're moving backwards,"" said Salah Zorob, 37, outside his tent. ""They're going to take us back to the Stone Age.""Tor Wennesland, the UN's special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, said delivery of humanitarian aid ""continues to face insurmountable challenges"".
He said Israel has taken positive ""limited steps"" but they fall far short of what is needed.
Explosions were heard Tuesday night in the northern Gaza area, over a live AFPTV feed.
Strikes on Rafah overnight Monday-Tuesday killed at least 20 more people, the Hamas health ministry said, bringing more suffering to the southern town that has become a vast camp for displaced Palestinians.
In Tel Aviv, air raid sirens wailed as rockets fired from Gaza sent Israelis running into shelters before the incoming fire was intercepted by an air defence system. 
 
- Rage -
 
Israel's military said its troops found explosives planted in a medical clinic in a Gaza City suburb, destroyed Hamas tunnels and killed Hamas operatives during recent operations.The army says 132 troops have been killed in Gaza since its ground invasion began in late October.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been detained in the military operations across Gaza, and on Tuesday the army said it is investigating ""the deaths of terrorists in military detention centres"". It gave no details.
US officials including Austin have urged Israel to protect civilians in Gaza. On Monday he vowed to also keep arming Israel, which receives billions of dollars in American military aid.
International alarm has spiralled over the suffering brought by the war for traumatised Palestinian families.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron on Tuesday urged Israel to take a ""much more surgical, clinical and targeted approach"" in dealing with Hamas.James Elder, spokesperson for the United Nations children's fund, UNICEF, expressed his rage after returning from Gaza.
He said he was ""furious that those with power shrug at the humanitarian nightmares unleashed on a million children"", including some who had undergone amputations and were then ""killed in these hospitals"", as bombardments continue.
One of the last remaining hospitals in northern Gaza, Al-Ahli, stopped operating after it was stormed and ""put out of action"" by Israeli forces, its director Fadel Naim told AFP.A draft of the resolution introduced by the United Arab Emirates called for an ""urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities"" to allow ""safe and unhindered humanitarian access"".
But according to diplomatic sources, a new, modified text calling for the ""suspension of hostilities"" is now on the table, in a bid to secure a compromise.
- Fears of escalation -
 
A top concern for many Israelis remains the fate of the 129 hostages still held in Gaza after 80 were freed last month in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
Hamas released footage it claimed showed three of those still held captive -- elderly and bearded men who asked to be released.
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari called it ""a criminal terror video that is evidence of Hamas's brutality toward innocent elderly civilians who need medical attention"".The Gaza war has sparked fears of regional escalation and seen Israel trade deadly cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon.
Israel's military said its air force ""attacked a squad of terrorists"" and a tank fired at a Hezbollah target while air defences took out ""a suspicious aerial target"" that flew in from Lebanon.
Huthi rebel attacks have also intensified on the Red Sea maritime zone crucial for an estimated 40 percent of Europe-Asia trade.Four of the world's biggest shipping companies -- CMA CGM Group, Hapag-Lloyd, Maersk and MSC -- have diverted their vessels, as has oil firm BP, in a move that sent up energy prices.
Voyages rerouted around Africa's Cape of Good Hope can take around 10 days longer, piling on fuel costs and threatening delays and supply shortages that can drive up consumer prices.
The US Navy already heads a maritime task force, created in April, focussed on ""maritime security and capacity building efforts in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandab and Gulf of Aden"", according to the website of the group known as CTF 153.

Israel bombs Gaza as UN warns civilians face 'grave peril',"Israeli forces on Thursday heavily bombed besieged Gaza as the centre of fierce combat against Hamas moves steadily south, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.
The war that started with the Hamas attack of October 7 has devastated much of northern Gaza, while air and artillery strikes and house-to-house fighting have been heaviest in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
The Israeli army has deployed an additional brigade to Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, said army spokesman Daniel Hagari.UN World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for ""urgent steps to alleviate the grave peril"" facing Gaza's people, including ""terrible injuries, acute hunger and... severe risk of disease"".
French President Emmanuel Macron in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced his ""deepest concern at the very heavy civilian toll"" and stressed ""the need to work towards a lasting ceasefire"", Macron's office said.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its bloody October 7 attack, which left about 1,140 people dead, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
The Hamas gunmen also took around 250 hostages, 129 of whom remain in captivity -- a source of intense grief and anxiety for their families who have held protests demanding urgent action to ""bring them home"".Israel's relentless aerial bombardment and ground invasion with troops and tanks have killed at least 21,110 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. 
The Israeli army says 167 of its soldiers have been killed in the war in Gaza.
 
- Quadruplets born in war -
 Amid the conflict, an Israeli siege has deprived Gazans of food, water, fuel and medicine -- the severe shortages only sporadically eased by convoys of humanitarian aid trucks.
One of the many people displaced, young mother Iman al-Masry, recently gave birth to quadruplets in a hospital in southern Gaza after fleeing her family's home in the devastated north.
The arduous journey ""affected my pregnancy"", the 28-year-old said, recounting that she gave birth by C-section on December 18 to two girls and two boys, one of whom was too fragile to leave hospital. 
""They are very slim,"" she said of the three other infants, speaking in a cramped schoolroom turned shelter in Deir al-Balah. ""It's cold and windy and there's no bathtub ... I just use wipes.""""There's no nutritious food I can eat to breastfeed the three babies.""
Violence has also flared across the Israel-occupied West Bank, with at least 314 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or settlers since October 7, according to the territory's health ministry.
Israeli forces made a deadly overnight raid into Ramallah, health officials said Thursday as troops raided money exchange shops which the military said had provided funds for armed groups.
An AFP journalist saw Palestinians hurl Molotov cocktails at Israeli forces, who killed one man according to the health ministry.Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and regularly carries out raids there, though they are far less common in the territory's institutional heart Ramallah.
A United Nations report Thursday said the human rights situation in the West Bank was rapidly deteriorating and urged Israel to ""end unlawful killings"" against the Palestinian population.
""The use of military tactics and weapons in law enforcement contexts, the use of unnecessary or disproportionate force, and the enforcement of broad, arbitrary and discriminatory movement restrictions that affect Palestinians are extremely troubling,"" UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.
 
- Mideast tensions flare -
 The bloodiest ever Gaza war has also sharply heightened tensions between Israel and its long-time arch foe Iran, which supports armed groups across the Middle East in what it dubs the ""Axis of Resistance"".
Iran blamed Israel for a missile strike in Syria on Monday that killed the senior Iranian military commander Razi Moussavi, who was laid to rest at a tearful mass funeral in Tehran on Thursday.
The crowd chanted ""Death to Israel"" and ""Death to America"" after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led a prayer over the body of Moussavi, a senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' foreign operations arms the Quds Force.
Guards spokesman Ramezan Sharif warned on Wednesday that ""our response to Moussavi's assassination will be a combination of direct action as well as (from) others led by the Axis of Resistance"".Israel has traded heavy cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon since the Gaza war broke out, and warned it will step up military action unless the group's militants withdraw further away from the border.
Army spokesman Hagari said Israeli forces had killed 129 Hezbollah militants since early October and that the Shiite movement ""is paying a heavy price"" for its attacks.
Another Iran ally, Yemen's Huthi rebels, has launched repeated drone and missile attacks at Israel, which have been intercepted in the air, and fired at passing cargo ships in the Red Sea, disrupting international trade.
A drone also crashed near a village in the Israel-annexed Golan Heights, Israel's army said Thursday, after an Iraqi armed group with links to Hamas claimed responsibility for an attack in the area.

US vice president calls for 'immediate ceasefire' in Gaza,"SELMA - US Vice President Kamala Harris called Sunday for a proposed six-week ceasefire deal in the Israel-Hamas war to be accepted, while criticizing Israel over insufficient aid deliveries into Gaza.
""Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table,"" Harris said during a speech in Selma, Alabama.
Her comments were the strongest to date by a US administration official on Israel since the war started, as President Joe Biden comes under acute pressure over his support for Israel and the civilian death toll in Gaza soars.
A senior US official said Saturday that Israel had broadly accepted the deal, which would see a six-week cessation of hostilities if Hamas agrees to release the most vulnerable hostages it holds.
The deal ""will get the hostages out and get a significant amount of aid in,"" Harris said, calling on Hamas to accept the deal.
""Hamas claims it wants a ceasefire. Well, there is a deal on the table. And as we have said, Hamas needs to agree to that deal.""
The Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the death of around 1,160 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures, with around 250 people believed to have been taken hostage.
The Israeli army says 130 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 31 are believed to be dead.
Israel's military response has claimed 30,410 deaths, most of them women and children, according to the Hamas government's Ministry of Health.
In unusually strong language, Harris called on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take steps to increase aid into Gaza.
""The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses,"" Harris said.
She added that Israel ""must open new border crossings"" and ""must not impose any unnecessary restrictions on the delivery of aid.""
 
- Gantz in Washington -
 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made similar remarks in a post on X, saying ""It is imperative that we expand the flow of aid into Gaza to alleviate the dire humanitarian situation.""
He added: ""People urgently need more food, water, and other assistance. That's why the US is working to get more aid in through every available channel, including air drops."" These started Saturday.
Harris is due to meet with Benny Gantz, a centrist member of Israel's war cabinet, in Washington on Monday.
""The vice president's meeting is part of our continued efforts to engage with a wide range of Israeli officials on the war in Gaza and planning for the day after,"" a White House official said Sunday.
The former Israeli military chief, a longtime rival of Netanyahu, will also meet White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan and Blinken, according to US officials.
""Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed,"" Harris said, highlighting the deaths on Thursday in chaotic scenes around a convoy of aid trucks.
People ""simply trying to secure food for their families after weeks of nearly no aid reaching northern Gaza... were met with gunfire and chaos,"" said Harris, adding: ""Our hearts break for the victims of that horrific tragedy.""
""The threat Hamas poses to the people of Israel must be eliminated.""
Harris delivered her remarks at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where a march by hundreds of peaceful activists was violently suppressed by police on March 7, 1965.
The event, known as ""Bloody Sunday,"" further catalyzed support for Black rights and helped lead a few months later to the passage of the Voting Rights Act, a federal law prohibiting racial discrimination in voting.

Discussion | Does the ICJ have the power to stop Israel's Gaza campaign?,"THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS - Yesterday  Israel's legal team shared its arguments at the  International Court of Justice.
They say Israel has no doubt it meets the legal test of ensuring the rights of Palestinians in Gaza exist.

During their presentation at the ICJ, Israel's legal team claimed Israel and its citizens will meet irreparable harm if the court rules in South Africa's favour. This follows remarks by South Africa that Israel has been showing no remorse in its military attack on Palestinians.
To discuss this further, the eNCA spoke to Janet Anderson, a freelance Observer of Hague Tribunals",Saturday 13 January 2024 - 18:19pm
World leaders urge Israel to avoid 'catastrophic' Rafah operation,"JERUSALEM - Israel's vow to push ahead with a ""powerful"" operation in Gaza's Rafah was met with a growing chorus of international condemnation Thursday, with leaders warning against catastrophic consequences for the 1.5 million Palestinians trapped there.
Australia, Canada and New Zealand warned Israel ""not to go down this path"", issuing a rare joint statement in the latest urgent appeal seeking to avert further mass civilian casualties. 
""An expanded military operation would be devastating,"" they said. ""There is simply nowhere else for civilians to go.""
Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been driven into Gaza's southernmost city by Israel's relentless military campaign, seeking shelter in a sprawling makeshift encampment near the Egypt border. 
Despite pressure from foreign governments and aid agencies not to invade, Israel insists it must push into Rafah and eliminate Hamas battalions. ""We will fight until complete victory and this includes a powerful action also in Rafah after we allow the civilian population to leave the battle zones,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement on Wednesday. 
His threats of an imminent incursion come as mediators race for a truce in the four-month-old war, which has flattened vast swathes of Gaza, displaced most of the territory's population and pushed people to the brink of starvation.
Should the Israeli assault on Rafah go ahead, the risk of atrocities is ""serious, real and high"", the United Nations' special adviser on the prevention of genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, said Wednesday.
 
- 'Delusional demands' -
 
In Cairo, mediators from the United States, Qatar and Egypt are seeking to broker a deal that would suspend fighting and see the release of the roughly 130 hostages still in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.""Israel did not receive in Cairo any new proposal of Hamas on the release of our hostages,"" Netanyahu's office said in a statement following Israeli media reports that the country's delegation was told not to rejoin negotiations until Hamas softens its stance.
While he did not comment directly on the reports, Netanyahu said: ""I insist that Hamas drop their delusional demands, and when they drop these demands we can move forward."" 
On Tuesday, CIA director William Burns joined the talks with David Barnea, head of Israel's Mossad intelligence service, while a Hamas delegation was in Cairo Wednesday. 
Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas, who governs the Israeli-occupied West Bank, called on Hamas to ""rapidly"" agree to a truce and stave off further tragedy for Palestinians.The US Federal Bureau of Investigation meanwhile revealed that its director, Christopher Wray, had made an unannounced trip to Israel to meet with the country's law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
Wray also met with FBI agents based in Tel Aviv, according to a statement from the bureau.
 
- Hospitals 'besieged' -
 
While truce negotiations enter their third day, Israel's military has kept up its bombardment of Gaza.
On Thursday, the Hamas-run ministry of health said 107 people, ""mostly women and children,"" were killed in overnight attacks.
One person was killed and several wounded in shelling on Nasser Hospital's orthopaedics department, it added. The medical facility, the largest in southern Gaza, has been the site of heavy fighting for weeks.
Doctors Without Borders has condemned the Israeli military's order to evacuate thousands of patients, staff and displaced people from the hospital.
The organisation said its staff are continuing to treat patients there ""amid near impossible conditions"".
Nurse Mohammed al-Astal told AFP the facility had been ""besieged"" for a month, with no food or drinking water left.
""At night, tanks opened heavy fire on the hospital and snipers on the roofs of buildings surrounding Nasser Hospital opened fire and killed three displaced people,"" he said.
The World Health Organization has said it was denied access to the hospital and lost contact with its staff there, while its Palestine representative said most of the organisation's mission requests have been denied since January.
Speaking from Rafah, Rik Peeperkorn said Gaza's hospitals were ""completely overwhelmed"".
Patients were frequently undergoing unnecessary amputations of limbs that could have been saved under ordinary circumstances, he said.The United Nations said a week ago there were no fully functioning hospitals left in Gaza, where more than 68,200 people have been wounded according to the latest Gaza health ministry toll.
The ministry says at least 28,576 people, mostly women and children, have been killed during Israel's assault on the Palestinian territory since October 7.
The Hamas attack that launched the war resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
 
- 'War in the north' -
 
With regional tensions high, the Israeli army said Wednesday that rocket fire from Lebanon killed an Israeli soldier, while Lebanese sources said Israeli strikes had killed nine people, seven of them civilians.
Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israeli troops, with tens of thousands displaced on both sides.After meeting commanders near the Lebanese border, Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi said Israel is ""now focused on being ready for war in the north"".

International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor has slammed the indiscriminate bombardment of the Gaza strip by the Israeli defence force.
READ: Sky above Gaza turns red in deadly night of strikes
While addressing the National Assembly, Pandor urged South Africans to call for a ceasefire and presented a number of steps to lead Israel and Palestine out of the conflict.
She said, ""as South Africans, we need to raise our voices and call for the following concrete action to end the suffering. One: an immediate comprehensive ceasefire.""
""Two, the opening of humanitarian corridors so that aid and all other basic services reach all in need. Three, all parties to exercise restraint and to desist in fueling this patently unjust war and human suffering, including by ceasing the supplying of weapons to the various parties.""
""Four, the release of all civilian hostages. Five, in light of statements on the use of nuclear power, the establishment of a Middle East nuclear weapons free-zone just as we have created in our continent, Africa.""
""Six, the resumption of a comprehensive led and owned by Palestinians and Israeli's themselves and facilitated by the United Nations.""
""Seven, the deployment of a UN Rapid Deployment Force in Palestine, mandated to monitor, the implementation of a ceasefire, cessation of hostilities and most importantly to protect civilians.""",Wednesday 08 November 2023 - 10:30am
Truce between Israel and Hamas extended for two days,"JERUSALEM - A truce between Israel and Hamas will be extended by two days, mediator Qatar said hours before the pause was due to end Tuesday, as more hostages were freed from Gaza in exchange for the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners.
""The Palestinian and Israeli sides have reached an agreement to extend the humanitarian pause in Gaza for two additional days under the same conditions,"" Qatar's foreign ministry said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.
Militant group Hamas also confirmed the extension, though there was no official word from Israel. 
The extension came as 11 more hostages were freed from Gaza, along with the release of another 33 Palestinian prisoners -- the last exchange under the existing deal.
The extension of the truce was welcomed internationally, with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres calling it ""a glimpse of hope and humanity in the middle of the darkness of war"".
The truce has paused fighting that began when Hamas militants poured over the border into Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping dozens, according to Israeli officials.
Israel's retaliatory ground and air operation in Gaza has killed almost 15,000 people, mostly civilians, according to the territory's Hamas government.
Late Monday, 11 hostages arrived in Israel, the country's military said.
""Our forces will accompany them until they are reunited with their families,"" it said in a statement, adding that the military ""salutes and embraces the released hostages upon their return home"".
Most of the group are dual nationals, with Argentinians, Germans and French among those released, and all 11 were from the Nir Oz kibbutz, the community said.The releases brought ""a sigh of relief to our community, however we remain deeply concerned about our loved ones that are still held hostage,"" kibbutz official Osnat Peri said.
Images released by the Israeli military showed French-Israeli child Eitan Yahalomi reunited with his mother, who gripped him tightly to her.
Shortly after the arrival of the hostages was confirmed, Israel's prison authority said 33 Palestinian inmates had been released.
In east Jerusalem, prisoner Muhammad Abu Al-Humus called his release ""an indescribable joy"" and kissed his mother's hand as he entered his home, while crowds in the West Bank town of Beitunia waved green Hamas flags to greet those arriving on a coach.
But nearby there were also clashes with Israeli troops by Ofer prison, with Palestinians burning tyres and throwing stones. The Palestinian health ministry said one person was killed.
 
- 'Unbearable suffering' -
 In all, 50 Israeli hostages have been released under the truce deal, in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners, with another 19 hostages freed under separate agreements, including Thai workers and a dual Russian-Israeli citizen.
Hamas said it was now drawing up lists of additional hostages to be released, though the process is reportedly complicated by the fact that some are held by other militant groups.
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that ""in order to extend the pause, Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children"".
Israel views the truce as temporary to secure hostage releases and plans to continue its war, with the government agreeing a 30.3 billion shekel ($8.2 billion) war budget that will now go to parliament.
But it faces increasing pressure for a more lasting ceasefire and the ramp-up of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where an estimated 1.7 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations.
This week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will pay his third wartime visit to the Middle East, meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in Ramallah. 
""The secretary will stress the need to sustain the increased flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza, secure the release of all hostages and improve protection to civilians in Gaza,"" a senior US official said.
He will discuss ""the principles he laid out for the future of Gaza and the need to establish an independent Palestinian state,"" the official added.
- 'Catastrophic' -
 Inside Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry said no fuel had arrived for generators at hospitals in the territory's north, despite the truce.
And UN official Tor Wennesland warned the humanitarian situation ""remains catastrophic.""
It ""requires the urgent entry of additional aid and supplies in a smooth, predictable, and continuous manner to alleviate the unbearable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza,"" the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process said.
The truce has allowed residents who fled fighting in northern Gaza to return to Gaza City, which has been ravaged by relentless Israeli bombardment.
People walked or bicycled along debris-lined streets, where the cars were flattened and buildings torn apart.
Gaza City Mayor Yahya al-Siraj said that without fuel, the territory could not pump clean water or clear waste accumulating in the streets, warning of a potential public health ""catastrophe"".The fighting has left many with devastating injuries, which doctors in Gaza have struggled to treat because of limited supplies.
Clean-up was under way at Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, which Israel targeted saying it was used as a command centre by Hamas.
""We hope it can soon resume its activities,"" said Gaza health ministry spokesman Mahmud Hammad.
A limited number of Palestinians have been airlifted to the United Arab Emirates for treatment after crossing from Gaza to Egypt, including seven-year-old Yussef, who gnawed on his nails next to his mother Nouzha Fawzi.
""He was not like that before,"" she said of Yussef, who suffers the blood disorder hemophilia.
""Since the war, he no longer speaks much. He is afraid of everything,"" she added. ""He asks me if he will die.""

EU eyes call for 'corridors and pauses' for Gaza aid,"EU leaders on Thursday debated calling for ""pauses"" in Israel's war with Hamas to get aid into Gaza, as the bloc weighed how to respond to the conflict as fighting rages in Ukraine.
The European Union has struggled for both unity and influence in the face of the crisis that has engulfed the Middle East since Hamas launched its attack on Israel on October 7.
The surge in bloodshed has stretched Europe's attention at a time of rising doubts about the West's ability to keep supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia.
The 27-nation bloc has long been split between more pro-Palestinian members such as Ireland and Spain, and staunch backers of Israel including Germany and Austria.
There has been strong condemnation of the Hamas attack, which Israel says killed at least 1,400 people and resulted in more than 220 people being taken hostage.
But there has been less consensus on urging any halt to Israel's retaliatory bombardment of Gaza, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 7,000 people.
After days of talks the latest draft statement for the summit calls for humanitarian ""corridors and pauses"" so aid can reach civilians in Gaza. 
That statement -- which could still change when leaders meet in Brussels -- falls short of demands from the United Nations for a ceasefire.
- Israel 'will follow the rules' -
Diplomats said Germany and other strong supporters of Israel sought to temper any wording that could be seen as tying Israel's hand. 
""Israel is a democratic state with very humanitarian principles that guide it, and that's why you can be sure that the Israeli army will follow the rules that come from international law,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. Irish premier Leo Varadkar said the EU ""might not use the exact same language as the United Nations"" but hoped the EU will call for ""a humanitarian ceasefire, humanitarian pause -- I'm not obsessed about what language we use"".
""What we want is the killing and the violence to stop so that humanitarian aid can get into Gaza, where innocent Palestinian people are suffering, and also to allow us to get EU citizens out.""
Diplomats from some EU nations warn that delays over finding the right words as the death toll mounts are hitting the bloc's global standing.
""We can feel that some in the world are using the circumstances to try to rally a part of the international community to attack the European Union,"" Michel said.  
- No to 'war fatigue' - 
The eruption of violence in the Middle East has sparked fears the West could get distracted from Russia's war on Ukraine, 20 months into the invasion.
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said the EU had ""no right for war fatigue"" over Kyiv's fight. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky was also due to call in to the summit.
But a fracture in EU unity appeared Thursday when Slovakia's new populist Prime Minister Robert Fico said his government was stopping its military aid to Ukraine.Chief among EU measures meant to reassure Kyiv is a plan -- earlier estimated at 20 billion euros ($21 billion) over four years -- for a defence fund for Ukraine as part of broader Western security commitments.
Leaders are set to task the bloc's foreign policy chief to report back on the issue in December.   
There will also be calls to impose new sanctions on Moscow that could include banning Russian diamond imports once the G7 agrees on a way of tracing them.
A plan for using the revenues from frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine will also be discussed.

29 Gaza babies evacuated to Egypt as another deadly hospital strike reported in Gaza,"GAZA - Twenty-nine premature babies were evacuated from war-torn Gaza to Egypt on Monday as the Hamas-run health ministry stated Israel of launching a deadly strike on the territory's Indonesian Hospital.
READ: ICC investigating possible war crimes in Gaza
Frantic diplomatic efforts were meanwhile underway to seal a deal for the release of some of the 240 hostages Hamas militants took during their 7 October attacks on Israel.
The Gaza health ministry charged that Israel's army killed at least 12 people in a strike on the Indonesian Hospital in the Palestinian territory's north, a war zone where entire city blocks have been reduced to rubble.Those killed included patients, said Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman of the ministry which has reported a death toll of more than 13,000 as the Gaza war rages on into its seventh week.
Dozens more were wounded and around 700 people remained trapped inside the ""besieged"" medical centre, Qudra said.
Israel did not immediately comment but pushed on with its withering air and ground campaign.
More than 2.4 million Palestinians are trapped in besieged Gaza and only a few hundred war-wounded and foreign passport holders have been allowed out.On Monday Egyptian media reported that 29 premature babies evacuated from Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, had been taken to safety in Egypt through the Rafah crossing.
A medical source told AFP the infants would be treated at El-Arish hospital 45 kilometres west of the Gaza Strip or be taken to Ismailia or Cairo.
The bloodiest ever Gaza war has seen Israeli troops raid, occupy and evacuate Al-Shifa hospital in recent days, spurring hundreds to flee the area on foot toward southern Gaza.Israel, backed by the United States, argues that Hamas has used vast tunnel networks below Al-Shifa for military purposes. It has shown recovered weapons but was yet to reveal evidence of a major military headquarters below ground.
After another Gaza building was hit, in Deir al-Balah south of Gaza City on Sunday, rescuers searched through the debris for survivors and bodies, using the lights of their mobile phones in the rain.
""There are only children and women in the house and no one else,"" exclaimed one resident. 
""How can that give them (the Israeli army) an excuse to hit it? ...  We don't have any equipment to pull people out from under the rubble.""
 
- 'Like the apocalypse' -
 
Alarm has surged over the dire humanitarian situation across Gaza.The Israeli offensive has killed more than 13,000 people, including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run government, fuelling mounting global pressure for a ceasefire. 
The UN humanitarian agency OCHA has described a ""collapse of services"" at hospitals amid shortages of electricity, fuel and medical supplies.
Palestinian officials said a field hospital sent by Jordan entered the Gaza Strip Monday.
""The hospital will be established in Khan Yunis, to receive the wounded and the sick, under catastrophic conditions which southern hospitals are experiencing, with the influx of hundreds of wounded each day and continued aggressive aerial and artillery strikes,"" said Mohammed Zaqout, director-general of Gaza hospitals.
On Sunday Israel presented what it said was evidence Hamas used Al-Shifa to hide foreign hostages and to mask tunnels, charges the group denies.
Released images showed what Israel said was a 55-metre-long tunnel along with CCTV footage from 7 October of two male hostages, from Nepal and Thailand, being brought there. ""We have not yet located both of these hostages,"" army spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters. 
AFP could not immediately verify the footage. 
Israel also accused the militant group of executing 19-year-old Israeli soldier Noa Marciano at Al-Shifa. 
As intense urban combat raged in northern Gaza, another 20,000 people fled south on Sunday, according to the UN humanitarian agency.""It's like the apocalypse, it's difficult, very difficult,"" said one tearful woman, Renad al-Helou. ""There are those who have lost sons and daughters, the wounded, pregnant women. 
""We are tired. There's no water, no food ... There's nothing left in Gaza. There's only destruction, suffering and torture.""
 
- 'Humanitarian disaster' -
 The Israeli army said on Sunday it was taking the Gaza fight against Hamas to ""additional neighbourhoods"".
Artillery and airstrikes destroyed several houses in central Gaza City, and doctors at the Al-Ahli hospital told AFP they had received dozens of dead and injured.
The Indonesian Hospital is located near the Jabalia refugee camp, where on Saturday a health official said more than 80 people were killed in twin strikes, including on a UN school sheltering displaced people. 
Israel's military has said Jabalia is among the areas of focus as they ""target terrorists and strike Hamas infrastructure"". 
Israeli forces were also reportedly pounding southern Gaza, where the Doctors Without Borders charity said 122 casualties had arrived at a facility in Khan Yunis, 70 of them dead on arrival.Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels on Sunday said they had seized in the Red Sea a cargo ship owned by an Israeli businessman and rerouted it to Yemen's coast.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the ship ""was hijacked with Iran guidance by the Yemenite Huthi militia"", an allegation Iran rejected on Monday. 
 
- 'Hole in our hearts' -
 Israel has refused to heed calls for a ceasefire before Hamas releases all hostages, among them infants, teens and pensioners. 
In London, the tearful father of missing nine-year-old Emily Hand begged for her to be freed. 
""There's just a big, big hole in all our hearts that won't be filled until she comes home again,"" he told AFP. 
Qatari mediators on Sunday touted progress on a deal that would free some hostages and pause the fighting, pointing to only ""very minor"" practical challenges.Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said: ""I'm now more confident that we are close enough to reach a deal."" 
But neither details nor a timeline were provided.
US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer also told US media that negotiators were ""closer than we have been in quite some time"" to a deal. 
But he cautioned: ""The mantra that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed really does apply.""

"Three US troops killed in Jordan, Biden vows reprisal","AMMAN - A drone attack on a base in Jordan killed three American troops on Sunday, with President Joe Biden blaming Iran-backed militants and vowing to hold the perpetrators to account.
It is the first time American military personnel have been killed by hostile fire in the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, and the incident will further raise tensions in the region and fuel fears of a broader conflict directly involving Iran.
Hamas said the death of the soldiers shows Washington's backing for Israel could put it at odds with the whole Muslim world if innocent lives continue to be lost in Gaza, and that the war there could lead to a ""regional explosion.""
""While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq,"" Biden said in a statement on the attack.
 
- Hold perpetrators 'to account' -
 
""We will carry on their commitment to fight terrorism. And have no doubt -- we will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing,"" the president added.US Central Command put the number of wounded from the attack near the Syrian border at 25, and said the identities of those killed will be withheld pending notification of their families.
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the killing of the soldiers ""is a message to the American administration that unless the killing of innocent people in Gaza stops, it may be faced with the entire (Muslim) nation.""
""The continuation of the American-Zionist aggression on Gaza risks a regional explosion,"" Abu Zuhri said in a statement.
US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria have been targeted in more than 150 attacks since mid-October, according to the Pentagon, and Washington has carried out retaliatory strikes in both countries.
Many of the attacks on US personnel have been claimed by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-linked armed groups that oppose US support for Israel in the Gaza conflict.
On Sunday, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it targeted US personnel with drones at three locations in Syria, including two bases near where the borders of Iraq, Syria and Jordan meet, but it was not immediately clear if the group was referring to the attack that killed the American troops.
Jordanian government spokesman Muhannad Mubaidin meanwhile said that the attack did not occur in Jordan and rather targeted a base in Syria.
The latest round of the Israel-Hamas conflict began when the Palestinian militant group carried out a shock attack on October 7 that resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
 
- Growing Middle East crisis -
 
Following the attack, the United States rushed military aid to Israel, which has carried out a relentless military offensive that has killed at least 26,422 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.Those deaths have sparked widespread anger across the region and stoked violence involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria as well as Yemen.
The Lebanon portion of the conflict has been limited to near daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel, but American forces are directly involved in Iraq and Syria, as well as in Yemen.
Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels have carried out more than two months of attacks on shipping, saying they were hitting Israeli-linked vessels in support of Palestinians in Gaza.
The United States and Britain have responded with two rounds of joint strikes against the Huthis, while American forces have also carried out unilateral air raids against the rebels, who have also declared US and UK interests to be legitimate targets.
The growing violence in multiple parts of the Middle East has raised fears of a broader regional conflict directly involving Iran -- a worst-case scenario that Washington is desperately seeking to avoid.

It's believed the strikes were the most intense since the war broke out.
Rescuers said most of the bombing was concentrated in the Jabaliya district of northern Gaza, flattening countless buildings.
Meanwhile aid agencies and international media say they have lost contact with staff amid a near total communication blackout.
The outage is also said to have disrupted ambulance services and humanitarian operations.",Saturday 28 October 2023 - 20:00pm
Israel hammers Gaza's south,"JERUSALEM - The Israeli army bombarded Khan Yunis, the latest epicentre of the war in Gaza, on Monday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected what he said were Hamas conditions for the release of hostages, even amid mounting pressure from their families.
Witnesses reported deadly strikes overnight in Khan Yunis, the largest city in southern Gaza, and fierce fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas militants.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza reported on Monday that more than 120 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours.
""Artillery shelling has not stopped since 5:00 am,"" said Yunis Abdel Razek, 52, who was sheltering with his family at the city's Al-Aqsa University.
""We can't leave the university... it's dangerous and I fear for the little ones,"" he said. ""They said the Al-Mawasi area was safe but they lied,"" he added, referring to a coastal strip west of Khan Yunis.
Mahdi Antar, 21, meanwhile said he feared forces would ""storm"" Al-Nasr Hospital where he was sheltering with his family.While fighting is concentrated in the south it has not ended in the north, where Hamas authorities reported shelling in the Gaza City area and witnesses heard explosions.
The strikes came after Hamas on Sunday issued a 16-page report in which they admitted to ""some faults"" but defended the October 7 attacks that sparked the war.
The attacks resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
In response, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, launching a relentless offensive that has killed at least 25,295 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll issued Monday by Gaza's health ministry.
 
- 'Necessary step' -
 
Hamas said in its first public report on the events that triggered the war that if civilians were targeted ""it happened accidentally,"" and called for an end to ""Israeli aggression"" in Gaza.
The October 7 attacks were a ""necessary step"" against Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners, said the report issued in English and Arabic.In a video statement issued after the Hamas report, Netanyahu said that ""in exchange for the release of our hostages, Hamas demands an end to the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza"", the release of Palestinian prisoners and guarantees that Hamas would stay in power.
""If we accept this, our soldiers have fallen in vain,"" and security would not be guaranteed, Netanyahu said.
The US coordinator for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, was due to meet top officials in Cairo on Monday, followed by a trip to Qatar, in a bid to secure a new hostage exchange deal, US media said.
 
- 'Unacceptable' -
 
Netanyahu is under intense pressure to secure the return of the captives and account for security failings surrounding the October 7 attacks.Hamas militants seized about 250 hostages and Israel says around 132 remain in besieged Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead hostages, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli data.
Relatives and supporters of the hostages again rallied, on Sunday night near Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence.
""We are asking our government to listen, to sit down at the negotiating table and decide whether to accept this agreement or any other that would suit Israel,"" said Gilad Korenbloom, whose son is a hostage in Gaza.
The 27 foreign ministers of the European Union are expected to hold separate talks with their Israeli and Palestinian counterparts in Brussels on Monday.
Ahead of the talks, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told Israel it couldn't build peace ""only by military means"", describing Netanyahu's rejection of a two-state solution involving Palestinian sovereignty as ""unacceptable"".
 
- Humanitarian crisis -
 
UN agencies have warned of famine and disease as Gazans, at least 1.7 million of whom are displaced, struggle with shortages of water, medical care and other essentials during daily bombardment.Abdelrahman Iyad, wounded in Gaza and now being treated aboard the French helicopter carrier Dixmude, docked in Egypt, said he did not have time to leave his house before it was hit.
""I was with my parents, my brother, my sister, my second sister and her husband and their daughter. They all died. I'm the only survivor,"" he said.
Rising tensions and violence across the Middle East -- involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen -- have stoked fears of a wider conflagration.
Sirens were heard overnight in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said, where there have been near daily exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.
Several areas of southern Lebanon were hit overnight, killing one Hezbollah fighter, according to a source in the Hamas-aligned group.

Middle East conflict | ICJ to begin two-day hearings,"JOHANNESBURG - The International Court of Justice will hear South Africa's genocide case against Israel today.
The country claims Israel has violated the UN Genocide Convention in its continuing assault in Gaza.
Both countries are signatories to the 1948 convention which gives the ICJ jurisdiction to rule on the dispute.
The South African delegation will be led by Justice Minister Ronald Lamola.
Over 23,000 Palestinians have been killed since October last year.
Israel is rejecting the claims and will present its case tomorrow.
Here the details of South Africa's International Court of Justice case today in the video below.

Hunger grips north of war-torn Gaza amid ongoing truce talks,"JERUSALEM - Dire food shortages sent hundreds of Palestinians fleeing northern Gaza on Sunday as Israel's war against Hamas raged on despite stuttering efforts towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal.
Desperate families in the north of the besieged war zone have been forced to scavenge for food as fighting and looting have stopped humanitarian aid trucks from reaching the devastated area.
Hundreds fled northern Gaza Sunday and headed south whichever way the could, walking down garbage-strewn roads between the blackened shells of bombed-out buildings, said an AFP correspondent.
""I came on foot from north Gaza,"" said one of them, Samir Abd Rabbo, 27, who arrived with his one-year-old daughter at the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip. 
""I can't describe the kind of starvation spreading there.""Without milk, he said, he had tried to feed his baby girl bread made from animal feed, which she was unable to digest. ""Our only hope is God, there is nobody else to help.""
Israeli forces meanwhile kept striking targets across the Palestinian territory and battling Hamas militants in heavy urban combat centred on the southern city of Khan Yunis.
The army said ""troops killed a number of terrorists and located weapons"" and ""apprehended terrorists who had attempted to escape by hiding amongst the civilians"". 
Close to the main battlefront, in the far-southern Rafah region, alarm has grown among 1.4 million Palestinians of a looming ground invasion feared to bring more mass civilian casualties.
The war started by the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel has ground on well into a fifth month and sent the death toll rapidly surging towards 30,000, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
 
- Ceasefire talks -
 
Talks have been held for weeks with the goal of reaching a temporary truce, to exchange Hamas's hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, and to step up aid deliveries.US, Arab and other mediators have voiced hope a deal can be reached before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on March 10 or 11, depending on the lunar calendar.
An Israeli delegation returned Saturday from the latest round of closed-door talks in Paris, also involving Egyptian and Qatari mediators hoping to bridge remaining differences.
Israel's national security advisor, Tzachi Hanegbi, said ""there is probably room to move towards an agreement"".
Media reports suggest both sides are weighing a six-week halt to fighting and the initial exchange of dozens of female, underage and ill hostages for several hundred Palestinian detainees.
Hamas has so far also insisted on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, a demand Netanyahu has dismissed as ""delusional"".An Israeli team will this week head to Qatar for further talks, media reports said, but Israel also ramped up the pressure by warning again that it will eradicate Hamas.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would convene the cabinet early in the week ""to approve the operational plans for action in Rafah, including the evacuation of the civilian population from there"".
""Only a combination of military pressure and firm negotiations will lead to the release of our hostages, the elimination of Hamas and the achievement of all the war's goals,"" he added.
 
- Scavenging for food -
 Israeli warnings of a Rafah ground invasion have sparked deep concern, and questions about where the Palestinians now living there would flee to in the devastated territory.
UN and other aid agencies have repeatedly warned that ""nowhere is safe"" in Gaza. 
Neighbouring Egypt has kept its border closed to a mass refugee flight, arguing it will not help facilitate any Israeli operation to push Palestinians out of Gaza.
But satellite images show it has also built a walled enclosure next to Gaza, in an apparent effort to brace for the arrival of large numbers of refugees.
Gaza's humanitarian crisis has meanwhile spiralled, with the UN World Food Programme reporting ""unprecedented levels of desperation"".
Some residents have resorted to eating scavenged scraps of rotten corn, animal fodder, the meat of slaughtered horses, and even leaves from trees. The health ministry said Saturday that a two-month-old baby named Mahmud Fatuh had died of ""malnutrition"" in Gaza City.
In northern Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, bedraggled children held out plastic containers and cooking pots for what little food was available. 
In AFP TV footage, protesters were seen holding signs that read ""our children are starving"".
One man said angrily that ""we, the grown-ups, can still make it, but these children who are four and five years old, what did they do wrong to sleep hungry and wake up hungry?""
 
- Protests in Tel Aviv -
 The war broke out after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures. 
Hamas militants also took about 250 hostages, 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 30 presumed dead, according to Israel. 
Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 29,606 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest tally issued Saturday by Gaza's health ministry.
The ministry said early Sunday that another 98 people had been killed overnight, with the Hamas media office reporting strikes along the length of the territory.
Inside Israel, public pressure has grown on Netanyahu -- both from the desperate families of hostages, and from a resurgent anti-government protest movement.
Thousands again rallied in Tel Aviv's ""Hostages Square"" Saturday night to demand swifter action.Nearby, protesters were blocking streets and calling for Netanyahu's government to step down as police deployed water cannon and mounted officers to disperse them.
""They are not choosing the right path for us, whether it's the economy, whether it's peace with our neighbours,"" charged one protester, software company CEO Moti Kushner, 54.
""It looks like they never want to end the war.""

"Arab, Western diplomats talk past each other on Gaza","CAIRO , Egypt- Cairo's ""Summit for Peace"" was meant to be a diplomatic breakthrough towards a ceasefire in Gaza, but its failure revealed what one analyst called the ""fault lines"" between Arab and Western states on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In their opening addresses Saturday, Arab leaders and Western delegates agreed on the need for aid to reach Palestinians in Gaza, besieged and under Israeli bombardment.
But after hours of discussion, they found common ground on little else, with the meeting ending without a concluding statement.
""The disagreement was over condemning Israel, which Western states refused to do,"" an Arab official told AFP, requesting anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media.
Instead, they sought a statement that placed ""responsibility for the escalation on Hamas"", which Arab states refused, according to a different Arab diplomat.
On October 7, Hamas militants launched a multi-pronged assault in Israel, killing at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 200 hostages, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has hit back with a relentless bombing campaign that has killed more than 4,600 people in Gaza, mainly civilians, according to Palestinian officials, and cut off supplies of water, electricity, fuel and food.
 
- 'Dialogue of the deaf' -
 
Though a number of Arab leaders condemned the loss of Israeli civilian life, they refused to place the onus on Hamas for the bloodshed.
Arab states -- some involved in the hostage negotiations with Hamas -- would have been ""in uncomfortable positions with their people"" if they had signed on to the condemnation, the Arab official said.Another point of contention, diplomats said, was Western diplomats wanting to call for the release of hostages abducted by Hamas.
Arab countries, with Qatar in the lead, have been negotiating their release in talks which could have been jeopardised if they signed alongside countries who have supported ""Israel's right to defend itself"", diplomats said.
With nothing left on the table, the meeting amounted to little more than a ""dialogue of the deaf"", according to regional expert Karim Bitar, and ended quietly.
The sole statement released was one from the Egyptian presidency -- drafted with the approval of Arab attendees, diplomats said -- that said decades of band-aid diplomacy had failed to find ""a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue"".
The summit, Bitar told AFP, ""perfectly illustrates the deepening fault lines between the West and the Arab world, and the Global South more broadly,"" as decades have not dulled ""the persistence of the Palestinian question"".
 
- 'No to normalisation' -
 
Though the list of Arab states with ties to Israel has grown in recent years, popular anti-Israel sentiment has remained strong.
Mass protests in support of the Palestinians have erupted in the region and beyond, with Egyptians taking to Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square on Friday for the first time in years after protests in the country were banned.
In Morocco -- which along with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed the 2020 US-brokered Abraham Accords, establishing diplomatic relations with Israel -- tens of thousands of protesters chanted ""No to normalisation"".
On what was dubbed the ""Friday of Rage"", crowds in Bahrain chanted ""Death to Israel!""
Across the Arab world, solidarity with Palestinians is still one of few causes capable of rallying consensus and mobilising political action.
""Many have pushed against this centrality,"" according to Bitar.
""For 20 years, we've been told to 'move along, there is nothing to see here, it has become a minor, low-intensity conflict',"" he said.
 
- 'Fall apart in our hands' -
 
But the idea of ""drowning out the Israeli-Palestinian question in an economic mega-deal between the Gulf and Israel"" turned out to be a ""pipe dream"", he continued.
Since hostilities began, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani -- whose government is supported by Iran-backed factions -- has condemned the ""genocide"" undertaken by ""the Zionist occupier"" on Palestinians.
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi meanwhile sounded the alarm, warning that the region's most fundamental peace deal -- the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel -- could ""fall apart in our hands"".
King Abdullah II of Jordan -- which became the second Arab state to recognise Israel in 1994 and hosts more than two million Palestinian refugees -- said on Saturday the war had revealed a culture of ""global silence"" on Palestinian death and suffering.
""The message the Arab world is hearing is loud and clear: Palestinian lives matter less than Israeli ones.""
After the abortive end to the Cairo summit, French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said world leaders ""must work to put the Palestinian question at the centre of concerns"".
Briefing reporters after the meeting, she said, ""see you in six months"" for the next ""Summit for Peace"".

Aid ship slowly heads for Gaza as calls for assistance grow,"JERUSALEM - A first boat loaded with 200 tonnes of food aid was making slow progress towards the Gaza Strip on Thursday as efforts grew to bring more humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian territory besieged by Israel.
The main UN aid agency in Gaza said an Israeli strike a day earlier hit one of its warehouses in the southern city of Rafah, killing an employee, although Israel later said a Hamas militant was killed in the rocket strike.
Donor nations, aid agencies and charities pushed on with efforts to rush food to the territory of 2.4 million people, where famine looms after more than five months of war.
Mediation efforts have so far failed to secure a new truce in the war triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed again that Israeli forces ""will reach every location"" in their mission to destroy the Islamist group.
""There is no safe haven for terrorists in Gaza,"" Gallant said on a tour of the Hamas-ruled territory, according to a video released by his office.
In response to the October 7 attack, Israeli forces have carried out a relentless campaign of air strikes and ground operations in Gaza, killing at least 31,272 people, most of them civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.
The Spanish charity vessel Open Arms was on its way to Gaza from Cyprus, towing a barge with 200 tonnes of aid in the first voyage along a planned maritime corridor to Gaza.
Once near Gaza, the aid will be delivered onto a pier built for the operation by US charity World Central Kitchen, which will then distribute it.
However, airdrops and efforts to open a maritime corridor were ""no alternative"" to land deliveries because they could only provide a fraction of the aid needed, 25 organisations, including Amnesty International and Oxfam, said in a statement Wednesday.In Gaza City, desperate Palestinians were awaiting the arrival of the Open Arms aid boat, which the charity operating it said could take days.
Standing on the shore, resident Eid Ayub told AFP that ""the aid coming by sea and dropped by air is not enough"".
""They send aid, but when this aid arrives, there's no entity to distribute it,"" he said, complaining of ""merchants"" who seize supplies and then resell them.
 
- Land routes needed -
 Cypriot Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos said on Wednesday a second aid ship ""with bigger capacity"" was being prepared in Larnaca.
Kombos also hosted a virtual meeting on Wednesday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and senior ministers and officials from Britain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the European Union and the United Nations to discuss the maritime corridor.
""The ministers agreed that there is no meaningful substitute to land routes via Egypt and Jordan and entry points from Israel into Gaza for aid delivery at scale,"" they said in a joint statement.They also agreed that opening the Israeli port of Ashdod, north of Gaza, to humanitarian assistance ""would be a welcome and significant complement"".
Senior officials will gather in Cyprus on Monday for ""in-depth"" briefings on the corridor, the statement said.
The Israeli military said the UN's World Food Programme had also sent an initial six aid trucks along an alternative land route from southern Israel through a gate in the security fence into northern Gaza on Tuesday.
 
- 'Supplies running out' -
 
The October 7 Hamas attack resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP count based on official figures.
The militants also took about 250 hostages, dozens of whom were released during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes about 130 captives remain in Gaza but that 32 of them are dead.
Israel's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive has reduced much of Gaza's urban infrastructure to rubble.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said in a statement at least one staff member was killed and 22 wounded ""when Israeli forces hit a food distribution centre in the eastern part of Rafah"".The agency's chief, Philippe Lazzarini, said the attack ""comes as food supplies are running out, hunger is widespread and, in some areas, turning into famine"".
Israel said later a Hamas militant was killed in a strike on Rafah and identified him as Muhammad Abu Hasna, one of four people the health ministry in Gaza said were killed in the strike on the UNRWA facility.
Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the United Nations secretary-general, told reporters that ""the Israeli army received the coordinates... of this facility"".
The Gaza health ministry also said later that four people were killed when Israeli troops opened fire on a group of people at Kuwait Junction, an aid distribution point just south of Gaza City.
 
- 'Not enough' -
 Rafah, on Gaza's southern border with Egypt, has so far been spared a ground invasion but the prospect of an Israeli operation there has sparked global alarm because it is crowded with almost 1.5 million Palestinians, most of them displaced.
Israeli officials have repeatedly threatened to send ground troops into the city, a warning reiterated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday.
The dire food shortages in Gaza have killed 27 people through malnutrition and dehydration, most of them children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
President Joe Biden has ordered the US military to build a temporary pier off Gaza to unload aid, a project Blinken described as ""a complement to, not a substitute for, other ways of getting humanitarian assistance into Gaza"".
Five Arab and European countries -- as well as the United States -- have also parachuted food into Gaza.Weeks of talks involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators failed to bring about a deal for a new truce and hostage release before the start of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan this week.
Fahd al-Ghoul, a resident of Jabalia Camp in the north, said: ""We have been fasting against our will for two months or more.""
""Now with Ramadan, nothing changes in our reality,"" he said.

UN Security Council for first time demands Gaza ceasefire as US abstains,"After more than five months of war, the UN Security Council for the first time Monday demanded an immediate ceasefire after the United States, Israel's ally which vetoed previous drafts, abstained.
Drawing unusual applause in the often staid Security Council, all 14 other members voted in favor of the resolution which ""demands an immediate ceasefire"" for the ongoing Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
The resolution calls for the truce to lead to a ""lasting, sustainable ceasefire"" and demands that Hamas and other militants free hostages seized on October 7.
Russia at the last minute objected to the removal of the word ""permanent"" ceasefire and called a vote, which failed to gain passage.
The successful resolution was drafted in part by Algeria, the Arab bloc's current member on the Security Council, with a diverse array of countries including Slovenia and Switzerland.
The United States has vetoed previous bids for a ceasefire but has shown growing frustration with Israel, including its stated plans to expand its military operation to the packed southern city of Rafah.
A change in tone toward its Middle Eastern ally was seen Friday, when the United States put forward a resolution to recognize ""the imperative"" of an ""immediate and sustained ceasefire.""
But that text was blocked by Russia and China, which along with Arab states criticized it for stopping short of explicitly demanding Israel halt its campaign in Gaza.
The United States had repeatedly blocked ceasefire resolutions as it attempts to walk a line between supporting Israel with military aid and voicing frustration with leader Benjamin Netanyahu as the civilian death toll in the Gaza Strip mounts.
Unlike Friday's text, the call for a ceasefire in the new resolution is not directly linked to ongoing talks, led by Qatar with support from the United States and Egypt, to halt fighting in return for Hamas releasing hostages.
Israel has criticized the Security Council for previous resolutions that have not specifically condemned Hamas.
The October 7 attack by the Palestinian militant group on Israel resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli figures. 
The militants also seized 250 hostages, of whom Israel believes around 130 remain in Gaza, including 33 presumed dead.
Israel's military campaign in response to eliminate Hamas has killed more than 32,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
The Security Council has been divided over the Israel-Hamas war since the October 7 attacks, only approving two of eight resolutions, which both mainly dealt with humanitarian aid.
And those resolutions seem to have had little effect on the ground, where UN personnel say Israel continues to block aid convoys as experts warn of looming famine.",Monday 25 March 2024 - 17:05pm
"Israel-Hamas truce begins, hostages to be released","GAZA CITY - A four-day truce in the Israel-Hamas war began on Friday, with hostages set to be released in exchange for prisoners in the first major reprieve in seven weeks of war that have claimed thousands of lives.
The two sides had agreed to silence guns and stop bombings from 7am in a conflict that erupted after Hamas's murderous raids into Israel on October 7.
As part of the agreement, 13 women and children held hostage in Gaza are due to be freed at 4pm, followed by a number of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, according to Qatari mediators.
Over the four days, at least 50 hostages are expected to be released, leaving an estimated 190 in the hands of Palestinian militants.
In exchange, 150 Palestinians prisoners are expected to be released.For Gaza's two million-plus residents, the deal brings a promise of respite from weeks of sustained Israeli bombardment.
The territory's Hamas government says the war has so far killed about 15,000 people and displaced countless more.
Around 15 minutes after the truce began, sirens warning of incoming rockets sounded in several communities along Israel's border with Gaza, the Israeli military said, without providing further details.  
The exact number of casualties in the war is impossible to independently confirm, but for many Palestinian and Israeli families, the truce came too late.
Qatari officials said the ""first batch"" of 13 hostages released would be women and children from the same families.

Diplomatic push for Israel-Hamas ceasefire intensifies,"JERUSALEM - International mediators and Hamas delegates were in Cairo Tuesday for talks to try to secure a pause in the war in Gaza ahead of the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 
Envoys from the Palestinian militant group and the United States were expected to meet with Qatari and Egyptian mediators for a third day of negotiations over a six-week truce, the exchange of dozens of remaining hostages for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and the flow of aid to Gaza.
Israeli delegates have so far stayed away from the negotiations, despite growing diplomatic pressure for a truce before Ramadan early next week.
Israeli media reported that the country's mediators boycotted the talks after Hamas failed to provide a list of living hostages.
Senior Hamas leader Bassem Naim told AFP however, that details on the prisoners ""were not mentioned in any documents or proposals circulated during the negotiation process"".Israel has said it believes 130 of the 250 captives taken by Hamas in the October attack that triggered the war remain in Gaza, but that 31 have been killed.
As conditions in the besieged Palestinian territory deteriorate and the spectre of famine looms, Israel is facing increasingly sharp rebuke from its top ally the United States. 
Vice President Kamala Harris expressed ""deep concern about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza"" during talks in Washington on Monday with Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz.
The same day, the World Health Organization said an aid mission to two hospitals in northern Gaza had found horrifying scenes of children dying of starvation, amid dire shortages of food, fuel and medicines.
""The lack of food resulted in the deaths of 10 children,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus after the agency visited the Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals over the weekend.In Gaza's main southern city Khan Yunis, which has seen heavy fighting, people described finding decomposing bodies lying in streets lined with destroyed homes and shops.
""We want to eat and live. Take a look at our homes. How am I to blame, a single, unarmed person without any income in this impoverished country?"" said Nader Abu Shanab, pointing to the rubble with blackened hands.
 
- UN tensions -
 
The Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 resulted in about 1,160 deaths, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed 30,534 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.
Tensions between Israel and the United Nations erupted Monday, with Israel recalling its ambassador over the handling of allegations of sexual assault by Hamas militants during the October attack.
Israel has accused the United Nations of taking too long to respond to the claims, as the body published a report on Monday that said there were ""reasonable grounds to believe"" rapes were committed in Hamas' attack, and that hostages taken to Gaza have also been raped.""In most of these incidents, victims first subjected to rape were then killed, and at least two incidents relate to the rape of women's corpses,"" the report said.
Shortly before the report's release, Israel said it was recalling its UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan over what it said was an attempt by the body to ""silence"" information of sexual violence by Hamas.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's spokesman denied trying to suppress the report.
Israel previously accused about a dozen employees of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) of involvement in the October 7 Hamas attack that began the war.UNRWA is at the centre of efforts to provide humanitarian relief in Gaza, where aid groups warn of looming famine after nearly five months of war between Israel and the Islamist group.
UNRWA on Monday said members of its staff had been tortured by Israel, with Israel's army accusing the agency of employing more than 450 ""terrorists"".
Phillipe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, has said that Israel provided no evidence against his former employees.
 
- Lebanon strikes -
 
The war has sparked violence across the region, including near-daily exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.""A diplomatic solution is the only way to end the current hostilities"" and achieve ""a lasting fair security arrangement between Lebanon and Israel"", US envoy Amos Hochstein told reporters in Beirut on Monday, adding that ""a temporary ceasefire is not enough"".
""A limited war is not containable,"" he said after meeting with parliament speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally.
On Monday, a foreign worker in northern Israel was killed and seven Indian workers were wounded in a missile strike near the Lebanese border, Israeli medics said.
Israel's army said late Monday it had carried out strikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon in response.
Hezbollah said three paramedics affiliated with the group had been killed in an Israeli strike.Their claim came after marine security firm Ambrey reported a Liberian-flagged vessel was targeted and reportedly struck off Yemen.

Israel battles Hamas militants inside south Gaza city,"JERUSALEM - Israeli troops battled Hamas fighters Thursday in the heart of southern Gaza's main city where a top militant leader is believed to be hiding, while pressing their offensive across the besieged territory.
Breaking through Hamas's defences of Gaza's second largest city, Israeli troops, tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers rolled into Khan Yunis, forcing already displaced civilians to flee again, witnesses said.
Hamas said late Wednesday on Telegram its fighters were engaged in fierce battles against Israeli troops ""on all axes of the incursion into the Gaza Strip"", as it claimed they destroyed two dozen military vehicles in Khan Yunis and Beit Lahia in the north of the territory.Earlier, the Israeli army said it had pierced defensive lines and carried out ""targeted raids in the heart of the city"", where they found and destroyed 30 tunnel shafts.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement that Israeli forces were closing in on the home of Hamas's chief in the Gaza Strip Yahya Sinwar, with a spokesman saying it is ""underground"" in the Khan Yunis area.
But humanitarian organisations have warned the spread of the war into the south of the Gaza Strip will leave civilians who fled the north, much of which is now devastated, with nowhere to go.
""We are devastated, mentally overwhelmed,"" said Khan Yunis resident Amal Mahdi. ""We need someone to find us a solution so we can get out of this situation.""
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group's October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities, and saw around 240 hostages taken.
The latest toll from the Hamas government said the war has killed more than 16,000 people in Gaza, most of them women and children.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and free 138 hostages still held after scores were released during a short-lived truce that broke down last week.
 
- 'Desperate conditions' -
 
Much of northern Gaza has already been reduced to rubble by fierce fighting and bombardment, displacing 1.9 million people according to UN figures.
Many civilians fled to Khan Yunis when Israel ordered them to evacuate the north of the territory earlier in the war.
They are now being pushed further south to Rafah on the border with Egypt.
""There was bombardment, destruction, leaflets dropping, threats, and phone calls to evacuate and leave Khan Yunis,"" said Khamis Al-Dalu, who told AFP he was first displaced from Gaza City, and then from Khan Yunis to Rafah.
""Where to go? Where do you want us to go for God's sake? We left Khan Yunis and now we are in tents in Rafah.""
And Israeli bombardments have followed them there.A strike on a residential district in Rafah left 17 dead and dozens injured late Wednesday, the Hamas health ministry said, and an AFP journalist saw the wounded, including children, being taken to a local Kuwaiti hospital.
Meanwhile, Al Jazeera television network said one of its journalists had lost 22 members of his family in a strike in the northern refugee camp of Jabalia.
The Israeli army said Wednesday it had struck about 250 targets in Gaza over the past 24 hours and that troops had found a major arms depot ""in the heart of a civilian population"" near a clinic and school in the north of the territory.
""The depot contained hundreds of RPG missiles and launchers of various types, dozens of anti-tank missiles,"" explosives and drones, it said in a statement.
AFP footage from Wednesday showed smoke trails after rocket fire from Rafah towards Israel.
 
- 'Minimal' fuel increase -
 
Mass civilian casualties in the war have sparked global concern, heightened by dire shortages caused by an Israeli siege that has seen only limited supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines enter.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he expects ""public order to completely break down soon due to the desperate conditions"" in Gaza, with ""potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as a whole.""
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen on Wednesday lashed out against Guterres, saying his tenure was ""a danger to world peace"" after he invoked a rare UN procedure over the Gaza war.
""His request to activate Article 99 and the call for a ceasefire in Gaza constitutes support of the Hamas terrorist organization,"" Cohen wrote on X.
""We, too, want this war to end,"" Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told reporters, ""But it can only end in a way that ensures that Hamas can never attack our people again.""On Wednesday, Israel approved a ""minimal"" increase in fuel supplies to Gaza, to prevent a ""humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics in the south of the Gaza Strip"", according to Netanyahu's office.
 
- New settlements approved -
 
The war has sparked fears of a wider regional conflict, with near-daily exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah across Israel's border with Lebanon and a surge of deadly violence in the occupied West Bank.
On Wednesday, Israel said a missile fired at the Red Sea town of Eilat ""was successfully intercepted"" after sirens blared in the resort.
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops raided two refugee camps and killed three Palestinians, one aged 16, according to the Palestinian health ministry and Wafa news agency.
Palestinian authorities say more than 250 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire or settler attacks since the war began.

Israel pounds Gaza on 99th day of war,"JERUSALEM - Israel pounded Gaza on Saturday as the Palestinian territory suffered under a dire humanitarian situation and grappled with a telecommunications blackout on the 99th day of the war.
Fears of the conflict widening have grown after US and British forces struck pro-Hamas Huthi rebels in Yemen following attacks on Red Sea shipping, with a fresh US air strike confirmed Saturday.
Witnesses reported Israeli bombardment of Gaza in the early morning, and an AFP journalist said Friday that strikes and shelling had hit areas between Gaza's southern cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah, crowded with people who have fled from the north.
All internet and telecommunications services in Gaza were cut Friday as a result of Israeli bombardment, the main operator Paltel said.""Gaza is blacked out again,"" it said in a post on social media platform X.
The Palestinian Red Crescent posted that the disruption was increasing the challenges in ""reaching the wounded and injured promptly"".
Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 23,708 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest health ministry figures.
The war began when Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on October 7, which resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. The militant group also seized about 250 hostages.
 
- 'Systematic' aid blocking -
 
UN aid agency OCHA's head for the occupied Palestinian territories told AFP on Friday that Israel was constantly blocking humanitarian aid convoys into northern Gaza.""They have been very systematic in not allowing us to support hospitals, which is something that is reaching a point of a level of inhumanity that for me is beyond comprehension,"" Andrea De Domenico said.
In central Gaza, a lack of fuel forced the shutdown of the main generator of Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah, the health ministry said.
""Does anyone care about us? Why is everyone silent?"" asked one mourner at a hospital where a group of Palestinians had gathered beside white body bags holding the latest casualties.
But the war didn't stop Afnan and Moustapha from getting married in Rafah, near the border with Egypt.""The house where the groom was supposed to live was destroyed, and as the war persisted, we thought it best for them to get married,"" Ayman Shamlakh, the groom's uncle, told AFP.
""We are all living through the same tragedy. However, we must continue to live, and life should go on.""
Mohamed Gebreel, father of the bride, said he had no doubts about going ahead with the ceremony.
""We are a people that love life despite death, murders and destruction,"" he said.
 
- Medicines deal -
 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Friday a deal had been negotiated with Qatar to get medicine to hostages still being held in Gaza.The deal ""will allow the entry of medicines for the hostages held by the Hamas terrorist organisation in Gaza"", Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
Israeli campaign group Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a report this week saying the captives were in poor health, some with complex illnesses, others with injuries.
A diplomat familiar with the negotiations told AFP that both sides had expressed a willingness to allow the delivery of medicines. 
""The mediators are now in the process of finalising the details"" of the type and quantities of medicines required, as well as the conditions for their delivery, the source said.
A source close to Hamas confirmed to AFP that talks had been held on allowing the entry of medicines, but that discussions were ongoing.
 
- 100 days -
 
Israel criticised the UN human rights office for not reiterating its calls for the release of the hostages in a statement marking the looming 100th day of the conflict.""A call for a ceasefire, without demanding the release of our hostages and the disarming of Hamas, is a call for terrorism to win,"" its office in Geneva said.
The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, has called repeatedly for the hostages to be freed.
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops killed three militants after they attacked a Jewish settlement, the army said.
It said there had been a ""terrorist infiltration"" in the Adora settlement, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) west of Hebron, and soldiers had come under fire.
The soldiers searched the area and ""three assailants were identified and neutralised by the security forces"".
When questioned by AFP, the Israeli army confirmed the death of the three assailants, while the Palestinian agency Wafa identified them as a 19-year-old and two 16-year-olds.

Gaza war rages on 100th day as Israel PM promises 'victory' over Hamas,"Israeli strikes pounded southern Gaza on Sunday, the 100th day of the war on Hamas which has claimed a surging civilian death toll and ravaged the besieged Palestinian territory.
The conflict, sparked by deadly attacks on Israel, has created a dire humanitarian crisis for the 2.4 million people in Hamas-ruled Gaza, the United Nations and aid groups warn, and reduced much of the coastal strip to rubble.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government has faced growing international pressure over civilian casualties in Gaza, vowed that ""no one will stop us"" from destroying Hamas.The Hamas government media office said Sunday that ""more than 100 people were martyred in the attacks last night until 6:00 am in all areas of the Gaza Strip"".
An AFP correspondent in Rafah, in southern Gaza near the border with Egypt, saw a thick column of smoke after strikes on the city where many displaced Palestinians have sought shelter in makeshift tents.
Fears that the conflict could spread across the wider region grew when new strikes hit Iran-backed Huthis in Yemen on Saturday, after the rebels warned of more attacks in solidarity with Gaza on what they deem Israeli-linked Red Sea shipping.
On the Israel-Lebanon border, which has seen regular exchanges of fire with Hamas ally Hezbollah, the Israeli army said it killed four gunmen who had crossed the frontier and ""fired at the forces"".Troops patrolling the Har Dov area -- Israel's term for the disputed Shebaa Farms district near the annexed Golan Heights -- ""engaged and responded with live fire"", a statement said, adding that ""four terrorists were killed"".
The war began when Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on October 7, which resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Hamas, considered a ""terrorist"" group by the United States and the European Union, also seized about 250 hostages, 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.Israel launched a relentless military campaign that has killed at least 23,968 people in the Palestinian territory, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
After the International Court of Justice in The Hague heard arguments that accused Israel of breaching the UN Genocide Convention, Netanyahu insisted that Israel will ""continue until victory"".
""No one will stop us -- not The Hague, not the Axis of Evil and no one else,"" he said at a televised news conference on Saturday, referring to the Iran-aligned ""axis of resistance"" groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
- 'Increased pressure' -Hamas's military wing the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades reported ""clashes with Zionist (Israeli) forces"" in Khan Yunis.
Further south, 80-year-old Palestinian Nimma al-Akhras said a strike had destroyed her house in Rafah.
""We started to scream and I couldn't move,"" she recounted, ""but someone pulled me out and put me on a cart.""
In Israel, Netanyahu's government has faced growing calls to rescue the hostages who have now been held in Gaza for 100 days, with thousands rallying in Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand action.""We will continue to come here week after week until everybody is released,"" Edan Begerano, 47, told AFP.
Bashir al-Zayadna, whose uncle Youssef and cousin Bilal were taken hostage on October 7, said their return ""is 100 days too late"".
""The war should end,"" he said. ""I wish to be able to hug them, to be able to tell them it's all over.""
Israel's largest labour union, the Histadrut, said hundreds of thousands of workers joined a 100-minute strike on Sunday.
""I hoped that a miracle would happen and we wouldn't need to stand here today,"" Histadrut chairman Arnon Bar-David told a Tel Aviv rally.
Israel, which after years of blockading Gaza imposed a siege as the fighting began, has said its ground forces have gained control over the territory's north.
- 'Traumatised' generation -
At Rafah's Al-Najjar hospital, mourners prayed near the bodies of slain relatives.One man, Bassem Araf, held up a photo of a child and said: ""She died hungry ... This is the resistance they are targeting in Gaza, just children.""
The Gaza Strip's people suffer acute shortages of food, water, medicine and fuel, and the health system is collapsing.
""The massive death, destruction, displacement, hunger, loss and grief of the last 100 days are staining our shared humanity,"" said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, during a visit to Gaza on Saturday.
He warned an entire generation of children in Gaza were being ""traumatised"", diseases were spreading and the clock was ""ticking fast towards famine"".
Winter rains have exacerbated the dire conditions for 1.9 million Palestinian displaced by the violence, according to UN estimates.Telecommunications have been partially restored in southern Gaza, an AFP reporter in Rafah said, after operator Paltel reported a complete outage on Friday.
In the occupied West Bank, where violence has surged since early October, the Israeli army said troops detained two sisters of Saleh al-Aruri, Hamas's deputy leader who was killed in a strike in Lebanon this month.
The brother-in-law of Aruri, Awar al-Aruri, said the two women had been put into ""administrative detention"", which allows for detainees to be held without charge or trial for renewable periods of up to six months.
The Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group said 5,875 Palestinians have been detained in the West Bank since the Gaza war began.
On a visit to Egypt, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged the establishment of a Palestinian state and a ceasefire in Gaza.
At a joint press conference in Cairo, Wang and his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry also called for ""an international summit for peace"" to find a ""lasting solution to the Palestinian cause"".

Israel-Palestine conflict | National Assembly mulls over shutting down Israeli embassy," 
JOHANNESBURG - Israel's war on the Gaza Strip continues to divide the world, with some countries deciding to sever ties.
South Africa has already demarched Israel's ambassador to South Africa.

On Thursday, the National Assembly debated the closure of Israel's embassy in South Africa.
This at the request of the Economic Freedom Fighters.

Israel bombs more Gaza targets as envoys seek truce,"The Israeli army said Thursday it bombed scores of targets in the Gaza Strip as diplomats pressed on with efforts to halt the fighting that Hamas says has killed 20,000 people in the Palestinian territory.
United Nations relief chief Martin Griffiths called the surging death toll a ""tragic and shameful milestone"" as the UN Security Council was to again discuss a draft resolution calling for a pause in the bloodiest ever Gaza war.
The army said its aircraft had struck another 230 targets in besieged Gaza over the past day, including a rocket launch site, while ground forces had found weapons inside a school in Jabalia near Gaza City.
Incoming rocket fire set off air raid sirens in southern Israel and Tel Aviv, where police reported falling shrapnel but no casualties so far after the projectiles were intercepted by air defences.
Hamas's military wing announced it had launched the Tel Aviv-bound ""missile barrage in response to the Israeli massacres against civilians"".
The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.The Hamas government's media office said Wednesday at least 20,000 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory, with 8,000 children and 6,200 women among the dead.
In the far-southern city of Rafah, a centre for many internally displaced Palestinians, fireballs and smoke rose after explosions on Wednesday.
""I wish for a complete ceasefire, and to put an end to the series of deaths and suffering,"" said one resident, Kassem Shurrab, 25. ""It's been more than 75 days.""
 
- Truce talks -
 
Hopes that Israel and Hamas could be inching towards another truce and hostage release deal have risen this week as the head of the Palestinian militant group visited Egypt and talks were held in Europe. Mossad director David Barnea held a ""positive meeting"" in Warsaw with CIA chief Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, a source familiar with the talks told AFP.
Qatar-based Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh visited Egypt on Wednesday for talks with the country's intelligence chief Abbas Kamel.
However, the stated positions of Israel and Hamas remain far apart.
A Hamas official told AFP that ""a total ceasefire and a retreat of the Israeli occupation army from the Gaza Strip are a precondition for any serious negotiation"" on a hostage-prisoner swap.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there could be no ceasefire in Gaza before the ""elimination"" of Hamas, which Israel, the United States and some other countries consider a ""terrorist"" organisation.
And US President Joe Biden said of a fresh hostage release deal: ""There's no expectation at this point. But we are pushing it.""Qatar, backed by Egypt and the United States, last month helped broker a first week-long truce that saw 80 Israeli hostages freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
One former hostage, Ofir Engel, 18, returned to Kibbutz Beeri alongside families of other captives and gathered at the burnt remains of their former homes.
""They abused us mentally,"" he recounted of his captivity. ""One of the most difficult moments was when terrorists moved us in complete darkness with lots of booms. 
""I was there. Every moment hostages are there it's dangerous. They have no time. Why do I get to be here and they don't? They have to come back home. Now.""
 
- Tunnel network -
 The UN human rights office in Ramallah said it had received reports that Israeli troops had ""summarily killed"" at least 11 unarmed Palestinian men in a Gaza neighbourhood this week.
The incident ""raises alarm about the possible commission of a war crime"", it said, adding the men were killed in front of their family members in the Al-Rimal area of Gaza City.
An Israeli official rejected the claims as ""nothing but blood libel"" and ""yet another example of the partisan and prejudiced approach against Israel"" by the UN body.
Israel said its troops had uncovered a tunnel network used by Hamas leaders including Yahya Sinwar, the Gaza chief of the militant group.
The military released footage Wednesday it said showed the ""large network"" around Gaza City's Palestine Square linking hideouts and residences.
Israel's army said three soldiers were killed on Wednesday, bringing the death toll of its forces to 137 in the Gaza Strip since ground operations began in late October.
An AFPTV live camera on Wednesday filmed two bombs hitting Rafah, where many of the territory's estimated 1.9 million displaced have fled.
The Hamas health ministry said Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians when houses and a mosque in Rafah were hit. It said later at least 30 more people were killed in an Israeli strike that hit two houses east of Khan Yunis.Crowds swarmed the rubble, digging with shovels and a backhoe to try to free the victims. One blackened body lay under a blue blanket on the blood-soaked ground.
""Enough, enough of this,"" Samar Abu Luli, a woman in Rafah, said after Israeli strikes on the city's Al-Shabura neighbourhood. 
""We have lost everything and we can't take it anymore.""
 
- UN impasse -
 
The UN Security Council was due to try once again Thursday to pass a resolution calling for a halt in fighting after previous efforts to win Washington's backing fell short.The United Arab Emirates is sponsoring a proposed resolution which has already been watered down to secure compromise, according to a draft version seen by AFP.  
It calls for ""the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities"".
The war has sparked fears of regional escalation, with exchanges of fire over the Lebanon border, and missiles from Iran-backed Yemeni rebels disrupting Red Sea shipping.
Israel said Thursday one of its fighter jets and artillery had struck Iran-backed Hezbollah militants overnight in response to incoming fire.

"Israel, Palestinian militants trade deadly fire over Gaza","GAZA - Israel's army and Gaza militants traded heavy cross-border fire Wednesday, with 22 Palestinians killed over two days amid the worst escalation of violence to hit the coastal territory in months.
Smoke billowed from the densely populated coastal enclave after Israel announced it was targeting rocket launch sites of the militant group Islamic Jihad.
Gaza's health ministry said seven people were killed, a day after Israeli strikes on the Palestinian territory left 15 dead.Sirens wailed in the Tel Aviv area warning of incoming rocket fire, an AFP journalist reported, and in communities close to the border, according to the army.
In a joint statement Palestinian militant factions said ""hundreds of rockets"" were fired, while the Israeli army reported 270 launches from Gaza.
Four of those killed Wednesday were fighters with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the group said in a statement.
The fatalities also included a 10-year-old girl, whose body was seen by an AFP journalist in Gaza City's Shifa hospital.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was ""ready for the possibility of an expanded campaign and harsh strikes against Gaza,"" in a meeting with local leaders near the coastal territory.Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service said it had received no immediate reports of casualties.
Israel's Iron Dome air defence system intercepted rockets above the coastal city of Ashkelon and elsewhere in the south, AFP photographers witnessed.
The latest violence comes a day after Israeli strikes on Gaza killed three top Islamic Jihad militants and 12 others, including four children, according to a health ministry toll.
- 'Tension and fear' -
Israel's military said Wednesday's strikes included firing on militants ""who were travelling to a rocket launch site in the city of Khan Yunis"" in southern Gaza.Islamic Jihad had vowed Tuesday to retaliate, with Israel warning its residents near the border to stay near bomb shelters.
Ahead of Wednesday's exchange of fire, Gaza's usually bustling shops were closed.
People in Gaza ""expect the worst"", said resident Monther Abdullah. 
""Everyone feels anxious and people aren't on the street much. I definitely feel like there's a war coming,"" the 50-year-old told AFP.
Speaking in Ashkelon before the rocket fire, resident Amos Gueta, 58, said there was a feeling of both ""anxiety and satisfaction that something is being done"" against Palestinian militants.The latest violence comes on the second anniversary of a devastating 11-day war fought between Gaza militants and Israel.
Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou said Wednesday ""the strikes of the unified resistance are part of the process of responding to the massacre committed by (Israel).""
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are considered terrorist organisations by Israel and the United States.
- West Bank deaths -
Among those killed Tuesday were four children and three senior Islamic Jihad operatives.The top militants were named as Jihad Ghannam, Khalil al-Bahtini and Tareq Ezzedine, a Gaza-based militant leader in the West Bank.
Earlier Wednesday, Israeli troops raided the West Bank town of Qabatiya, killing two people whom the army accused of firing at soldiers.
The Palestinian health ministry identified the two men as Ahmed Jamal Tawfiq Assaf, 19, and Rani Walid Ahmed Qatanat, 24.
The Israeli military said troops detained one person during the raid when soldiers were shot at from a vehicle.""The soldiers responded with live fire toward the two assailants and killed them,"" the army said.
Mourners including armed militants later carried the two men's bodies through the streets in a funeral procession.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since the Six-Day War of 1967 and its forces regularly operate in Palestinian cities.
- 'Barbaric' strikes -
The Arab League on Wednesday condemned the ""aggressive (and) barbaric Israeli raids on the Gaza Strip, which targeted civilians, children and women in residential neighbourhoods"".The Gaza violence this week is the worst since a three-day escalation in August killed 49 Palestinians, with no Israeli fatalities.
Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh spoke Wednesday to Qatar, Egypt and the United Nations, key mediators in Gaza, his spokesman Taher al-Nunu said.
While Hamas has fought multiple wars with Israel in recent years, the group stayed on the sidelines of last year's conflict fought between Israel and Islamic Jihad.Nineteen Israelis, one Ukrainian and one Italian have been killed over the same period, according to an AFP count based on official sources from the two sides.
These figures include combatants as well as civilians, and, on the Israeli side, three members of the country's Arab minority.",Wednesday 10 May 2023 - 09:48am
Gaza's starving children need a 'flood' of aid: UN,"GAZA - The United Nations on Tuesday called on the international community to ""flood"" Gaza with aid amid reports that children are dying of starvation in the war-torn Palestinian territory.
READ: Hunger grips north of war-torn Gaza 
""With children starting ... to die from starvation, that should be an alarm like no other,"" Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency, told reporters in Geneva.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported that 15 children have starved to death in a single hospital, and the UN has said famine is ""almost inevitable"" in the territory, under assault by Israel since the Hamas 7 October attacks into southern Israel.
The UN's World Health Organization reported ""grim"" findings and scenes of starving children after reaching two northern hospitals with aid last weekend for the first time since October.
Doctors at Kamal Adwan hospital, the only paediatrics hospital in northern Gaza, told the team that ""at least 10 children had died due to starvation"", Ahmed Dahir, who headed the mission, told a Geneva press briefing from the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.
The health ministry has since reported that the number of child deaths at the hospital due to malnutrition and dehydration had risen to 15, with another six acutely malnourished infants at dire risk.
- 'Flood Gaza with aid' -
""If not now, when is the time to pull the stops, break the glass and flood Gaza with the aid that it needs?"" Laerke asked.
""That is what we need to see happen.""
US cargo planes airdropped more than 36,000 meals in northern Gaza on Tuesday in a joint operation with Jordan, the US military said.
But US officials have also warned that the international operation is not enough.
A UN assessment in January indicated that more than 15 percent of children under the age of two in northern Gaza -- one in six -- were acutely malnourished, while three percent were suffering from life-threatening severe wasting.
In southern Gaza, five percent of children aged under two were acutely malnourished, according to that assessment, with the WHO warning the situation had likely gotten worse in recent weeks.
- 'Alarming' -
The strict criteria for declaring the situation in Gaza a full-blown famine have yet to be met, but the situation remains dire.
Starvation, or the absolute deficit of calories, can lead to things like organ failure, James Elder, spokesman for the UN children's agency UNICEF, told reporters.
Before reaching that point though, severe malnutrition can be a significant underlying cause of death, leaving children many times more likely of succumbing to common childhood diseases.
The fact that malnutrition itself is now also being listed as the direct cause of children's deaths is therefore ""alarming"", Elder said.
While the famine label might draw more media attention, he stressed that ""it doesn't make a lot of difference for the children on the ground"".

Israel opens Gaza aid crossing as pressure mounts for restraint,"Israel reopened an aid crossing into Gaza on Friday as key backer the United States urged more restraint in its all-out offensive against Hamas. 
The war began after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that Israeli officials say killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
Vowing to destroy Hamas and bring home an estimated 250 hostages taken by militants into Gaza, Israel launched a massive military offensive that has left much of the besieged territory in ruins.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip says the war has killed more than 18,700 people, mostly women and children.
Fierce fighting continued on Friday, with Hamas claiming they had blown up a house containing Israeli soldiers in the city of Khan Yunis.
Further south in Rafah near the Egyptian border, crowds of Palestinians used flashlights to search the rubble of buildings for survivors following Israeli strikes.""This is a residential neighbourhood, women and children live here, as you can see,"" said resident Abu Omar. ""Three missiles on a residential neighbourhood that has nothing to do with any militant activities.""
Multiple rockets were intercepted over Jerusalem by its powerful missile-defence system.
Under pressure to do more to spare civilians, Israel announced it would allow the ""temporary"" entry of aid into Gaza through a second crossing, at Kerem Shalom near Rafah, the only other point of entry for humanitarian supplies. 
 
- 'We will destroy them' -
 
The Israeli army said Friday that 119 troops had died in Gaza since the start of the ground offensive.""We are working together with security agencies, and with all intelligence and operational means in order to return all of the hostages home,"" the army said.
The United States, which provides billions of dollars in military aid to Israel, has strongly backed its response to Hamas's attacks, but has voiced increasing concern over civilian casualties and the long-term plan for Gaza.
""We do not believe that it makes sense for Israel, or is right for Israel, to... reoccupy Gaza over the long term,"" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv.
Gallant warned that Israel's fight with Hamas ""will last more than several months, but we will win and we will destroy them"".
In Washington, US President Joe Biden reiterated calls for greater care for Gazan civilians.
""I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives -- not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful,"" said Biden.
Sullivan also travelled to the West Bank to meet Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, who said Gaza must remain an ""integral part"" of the Palestinian state. Abbas's Palestinian Authority runs the Israeli-occupied West Bank, but is deeply unpopular with Palestinians and has been further weakened by the war.
More than 280 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since the war began. 
Multiple Western nations, including Australia, Britain, Canada, France and the European Union, demanded on Friday that Israel ""take concrete steps to halt unprecedented violence by Israeli settlers"". 
Meanwhile, a journalist for Turkish agency Anadolu was severely assaulted by Israeli police while trying to take photos of Palestinians praying in East Jerusalem. 
A police spokesperson said the officers were suspended. 
 
- 'Desperate, hungry, terrified' -
 This week, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly supported a non-binding resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza, with Washington voting against it.
The UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced.
Its humanitarian agency OCHA says more than a third of households have reported severe hunger, while more than 90 percent are ""going to bed hungry"".
Adding to the desperation, mobile and internet communications were cut Thursday and yet to return the following day, with operator Paltel blaming ""the cut off of main fibre routes from the Israeli side"".
Hamas's media office described it as a ""premeditated crime that deepens the humanitarian crisis"" by making it harder for rescuers to reach injured people.
Aid distribution has largely stopped in most of Gaza, except on a limited basis in the Rafah area, according to the UN.Fears of a wider regional conflagration persist.
Yemen's Huthi rebels struck a cargo ship in the Red Sea on Friday, causing a fire on deck, amid near-daily attacks in the commercially vital waterway.
The rebels later claimed they fired missiles at two other ships in the Red Sea.
The Iran-backed Huthis, who control much of Yemen but are not recognised internationally, say they're targeting shipping to pressure Israel during its war with Hamas.
""While the Huthis are pulling the trigger, so to speak, they're being handed the gun by Iran,"" said Sullivan.

Dozens killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza: health ministry,"Israeli strikes have killed dozens more people, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Thursday, including in the territory's south where Israel has intensified operations.
In the occupied West Bank, where violence has surged alongside the war in Gaza, an Israeli raid continued into a second day around Tulkarem, an official said. Palestinian sources reported a sixth person had been killed in the operation.
The latest violence came as medicine for hostages held by the militants and fresh aid for civilians entered the Palestinian territory under a newly brokered deal, mediator Qatar said.
The measure provided at least some relief in a region where tensions flared further following Pakistani strikes on an Iranian border region, and new US military action targeting Iran-backed rebels in Yemen.
Gaza's health ministry said 93 people had been killed, including 16 in one strike on a house in the southern city of Rafah, where many people have fled.""The strike left 16 killed, among them women and children, and 20 injured,"" the ministry said.
A man sat quietly among the rubble after one strike in Rafah, his head bowed, examining a child's glove.
Umm Walid al-Zamli said she lost her children, and her house.
""The eldest was a second-grade girl,"" she said in a choked voice. ""What did they do wrong? We can't rely on anyone, or the Arabs. We can only rely on ourselves.""
The Hamas government reported dozens of strikes, including on the southern city of Khan Yunis and Palestinian refugee camps in central Gaza.
An explosion sounded before a heavy grey cloud of smoke rolled over central-southern Gaza in the early afternoon, live AFPTV images showed.
Israel's military on Thursday said dozens of militants had been killed over the previous day in Khan Yunis, where it reported battles ongoing.
 
- 'Moment of relief' -
 
Fighting has ravaged Gaza since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel that resulted in the death of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel is conducting relentless bombardment and a ground offensive. These have killed at least 24,448 Palestinians, around 70 percent of them women, children and adolescents, according to health ministry figures.
Militants seized about 250 hostages during the October 7 attacks, around 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.
At least 27 hostages are believed to have been killed, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. The fate of those still in captivity has gripped Israeli society, leading to pressure on the government for their release.
UN agencies say greater aid access is urgently needed to Gaza, where famine and disease threatens.Qatar said late Wednesday that medicine for hostages and aid had entered Gaza under the agreement announced the day before, following French and Qatari mediation.
It said earlier two planes had arrived in the Egyptian city of El-Arish near Gaza with 61 tonnes of aid provided by Qatar and France.
The International Committee of the Red Cross welcomed the deal as ""a much-needed moment of relief"", under which 45 hostages are expected to receive medication.
 
- Baby Bibas -
 
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the army was hitting Khan Yunis particularly hard to dismantle the Hamas leadership, which the army says has already been done in northern Gaza.The Israeli military says 193 soldiers have been killed in Gaza since ground operations began in late October.
The war has displaced roughly 85 percent of Gazans, the UN says. Many have crowded into shelters where they struggle to get food, water, fuel and medical care.
At Israel's Nir Oz kibbutz, Yossi Schneider is clinging to hope for his relative Kfir Bibas, a baby, despite Hamas's announcing his death, along with that of his brother and mother.
The youngest hostage was less than nine months old when militants snatched him from his bed on October 7. He would be celebrating his first birthday on Thursday.
""We are thinking about them every day, every second, every minute,"" Schneider said.
 
- Iranian strikes -
 
In the West Bank, violence has escalated to a level not seen since the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, of 2000-05.
Army raids and attacks by settlers have killed about 360 people in the territory, according to its health ministry.
The losses are also economic. The World Bank has estimated the West Bank's gross domestic product could fall by six percent this year.The Palestinian Red Crescent on Thursday reported a man killed by ""an occupation bullet in the chest"" in Nur Shams camp near Tulkarem, where an Israeli raid continued about 30 hours after it began, said Rami Elyan, an official in Nur Shams.
""Like every time, bulldozers destroyed the roads and some homes,"" he said.
Israeli forces killed 10 people in the West Bank on Wednesday, the ministry and the army said.
Five were killed inside Tulkarem refugee camp, according to the ministry, while Israel's military confirmed an air strike that killed ""a number of terrorists"" during a raid there.
In the latest incident to unsettle the Middle East, Iranian state media said Pakistani strikes Thursday on an Iranian border region killed nine people. Pakistan said it had targeted militants.
This followed a rare Iranian air strike, late on Tuesday, which Iranian media said targeted a group which in December claimed the killing of at least 11 Iranian policemen.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards earlier said they had destroyed the ""Zionist regime's spy headquarters in the Kurdistan region of Iraq"". Tehran also launched attacks on targets in Syria.US forces late Wednesday said they conducted a fourth round of strikes on areas of Yemen controlled by Iran-backed Huthi rebels who have disrupted shipping in the Red Sea. The US military said it struck 14 Huthi missiles that were loaded to be fired.",Wednesday 17 January 2024 - 13:15pm
UN warns Gaza fuel shortage will stop aid work by end of day,"UN - The main UN aid agency in besieged Gaza warned it will have to stop operations by the end of Wednesday because it is running out of fuel, as Hamas said overnight Israeli strikes killed at least 80 people.
Alarm has grown about the spiralling humanitarian crisis in heavily bombarded Gaza where one doctor said he was forced to perform emergency surgery on the wounded without anaesthetic.
Israel has cut off impoverished Gaza's usual water, food and other supplies, and fewer than 70 relief trucks have entered since the war started -- ""a drop of aid in an ocean of need"", warned UN chief Antonio Guterres.
Israel launched withering strikes on Gaza in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas militants who, while launching a massive rocket barrage, killed more than 1,400 people and took 222 hostages on October 7, according to Israeli authorities.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to ""eliminate Hamas"" and Israeli bombing has now killed more than 5,800 people in Gaza, many of them children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Inside the battered Palestinian territory, Abu Ali Zaarab, whose family house in Rafah was bombed, charged angrily that ""they're not waging war on Hamas, they're waging war on children... It's a massacre.""
Tempers flared at the United Nations where Guterres decried the ""epic suffering"" in Gaza and the ""collective punishment"" of its 2.4 million residents, drawing a furious response from Israel.""Mr secretary-general, in what world do you live?"" replied an infuriated Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who recounted graphic accounts of civilians including young children killed in the deadliest single attack in Israeli history.
Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, called on Guterres to resign, writing on X, formerly Twitter, that the UN chief had ""expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder"".
US President Joe Biden -- who has strongly backed Israel's war after what he called the ""barbaric"" Hamas attacks, but also brokered the entry relief trucks via Egypt -- shared the concern that the aid lifeline is ""not fast enough"".
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""food, water, medicine and other essential humanitarian assistance must be able to flow into Gaza"" and that ""humanitarian pauses must be considered for these purposes"".
 
- 'This is a tragedy' -
 On the 19th day of Israeli air and artillery strikes and a near-total land, sea and air blockade of Gaza, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA warned operations are at breaking point.
""If we do not get fuel urgently, we will be forced to halt our operations in the Gaza Strip,"" said the agency which provides aid to 600,000 displaced in Gaza, where many families have slept in the open.
Israel has refused to allow fuel shipments into Gaza, fearing Hamas will use it for weapons and explosives and accusing the militant group of stockpiling supplies in large tanks.
Aid groups have warned that more people will die if medical equipment, water desalination plants and ambulances stop running in Gaza, where the only power plant went offline weeks ago.Patients are already being treated on the floors of hospitals overwhelmed with thousands wounded by bombing. The Red Cross has warned that hospitals, once the generators stop running, ""turn into morgues"".
""We performed a number of surgeries on the wounded without anaesthetic,"" said Ahmad Abdul Hadi, an orthopaedic surgeon working in the emergency room of Nasser hospital, Khan Yunis.
""It's tough and painful, but with the lack of resources, what can we do?""
Aid agencies report that shelters and emergency tent cities are heaving under the weight of an estimated 1.4 million displaced -- more than half the population of the 40-kilometre (25-mile) long coastal strip.Amine Abu Jazar, a displaced resident from Rafah, recounted how ""at midnight, while we were sleeping, we suddenly felt shrapnel and rocks falling on us.
""We already have injured and martyrs among us, this is a tragedy. There's not even any electricity to see each other, the dead or the injured.""
 
- Crisis diplomacy -
 
The Gaza war has sparked fears of a regional conflagration if it draws in more of Israels' enemies -- especially Iran-backed groups such as Lebanon's Hezbollah which has already traded deadly cross-border fire with Israel.
Israeli strikes also killed eight soldiers early Wednesday in the south of Syria, another Iran ally, state media reported, in what the Israeli army said was a response to earlier rocket fire.Blinken told the UN Security Council that Washington ""does not seek conflict with Iran"" but also warned that ""if Iran or its proxies attack US personnel anywhere, make no mistake, we will defend our people, we will defend our security -- swiftly and decisively"".
Hezbollah leader met with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad senior representatives in Beirut Wednesday to discuss how ""to achieve real victory... in Gaza and Palestine"" and stop Israel's ""brutal aggression"", a statement said.
French President Emmanuel Macron -- the latest Western leader headed to the region for crisis diplomacy -- was in Jordan after visits to both Israel and the Palestinian territories and was later headed to Egypt.Israel has meanwhile continued to mass tens of thousands of troops outside Gaza ahead of a ground offensive that has been anticipated for more than two weeks.
Military planners acknowledge it would mean difficult urban combat in a densely populated area latticed by tunnels and would imperil remaining civilians and the hostages.
""There are a lot of obstacles,"" an Israeli soldier serving with the military engineering corps told AFP on condition of anonymity.
""The enemy is spraying rockets and other things that I cannot detail to prevent us from progressing.""
So far Hamas has released four hostages after mediation involving Qatar and Egypt, including Israeli Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, who later spoke of the ""hell"" of her abduction.She recalled how gunmen raided her kibbutz home, threw her over the back of a motorbike and beat her as they raced back into Gaza, recounting that ""they hurt me very much"".
She and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper were released on ""compelling humanitarian"" grounds, according to Hamas, and Lifshitz also said the hostages were treated well once they were being held in captivity.
Both of their octogenarian husbands are still in Gaza along with more than 200 other Israeli and foreign hostages.

Qatar says Gaza truce proposal to be sent to Hamas as war rages on,"DOHA - A framework to halt the Gaza fighting and for hostage releases is to be relayed to Hamas, mediator Qatar said, as a bitter row flared around the UN aid agency for Palestinians.
While deadly fighting again rocked Gaza, fears mounted of a widening regional conflict after Israel's top ally Washington vowed to respond to an attack that killed three US troops in Jordan.
Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who attended the talks, said ""good progress"" had been made and the parties were ""hoping to relay this proposal to Hamas and to get them to a place where they engage positively and constructively in the process"".
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed hope for the deal.
""Very important, productive work has been done. And there is some real hope going forward,"" Blinken told reporters after the Paris talks.",Tuesday 30 January 2024 - 06:30am
Fighting rages across Gaza where death toll surges,"GAZA - Health officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip on Saturday reported a surging death toll in fighting with Israel, whose leader Benjamin Netanyahu rejected calls for ""Palestinian sovereignty"" after the war.
WATCH: Power to Truth | Israel-Palestine war | 16 January 2024
As fighting raged across the besieged territory, a strike in Syria blamed on Israel and missiles fired at US-led coalition forces in Iraq raised further fears of a wider conflagration.
Gaza's health ministry reported at least 165 people killed over the previous 24 hours -- more than double Friday's figure.
An AFP correspondent reported gunfire, air strikes and tank shelling, especially in southern Gaza's Khan Yunis city.
Israel is pressing its push southwards against Hamas, after the army in early January said the militants' command structure in northern Gaza had been dismantled, leaving only isolated fighters.But Hamas reported fierce combat in north Gaza as Israel's military said troops backed by air and naval support were striking militant infrastructure throughout the Palestinian territory, including the north.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the Palestinian group's unprecedented October attacks which resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Israel's relentless bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 24,927 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas government's health ministry.
 
- 'Retain control' -
 
The United States, which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, has urged it to take more care to protect civilians, and the two sides have disagreed over Gaza's future governance.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden Friday discussed the post-war future of Gaza amid a dire humanitarian situation.Biden said it was still possible Netanyahu could agree to some form of Palestinian state, after the two leaders spoke for the first time in nearly a month.
But Netanyahu's office in a statement Saturday said he ""reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty"".
The UN's UNRWA agency for Palestinian refugees says about 1.7 million people have been displaced in Gaza by the war.
About one million are crowded into the Rafah area in the far south, near Egypt.
UN agencies have warned better aid access -- including through Israel's Ashdod port -- is needed urgently as famine and disease loom.
After Friday's Biden-Netanyahu call, the White House said Israel would allow flour shipments for Palestinians through Ashdod.
 
- Spy chief -
 The war in Gaza has sent regional tensions soaring, with a surge in violence involving Iran-backed Hamas allies.
Iranian media said an Israeli strike on Damascus killed the Revolutionary Guards' spy chief for Syria and four other Guards members, with Tehran's foreign ministry threatening retaliation ""at the appropriate time and place"".
The Guards later confirmed five fatalities among its ranks.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the strike claimed 10 lives.
Israel, which has declined to comment on the Damascus strike, has intensified attacks on targets in Syria since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7.
In Gaza, the UN humanitarian agency OCHA reported only 15 bakeries were operating across the narrow territory.
Water availability for drinking and domestic use ""is shrinking every day"", OCHA added.
It also said that without immediate funding and an expanded response, 375,000 malnourished children and vulnerable mothers risk severe undernourishment.
 
- Torture fears -
 Israel's military said individuals suspected of involvement in ""terrorist activities"" were being treated in accordance with international law.
During the October attacks militants seized about 250 hostages, around 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza. At least 27 captives are believed to have been killed, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 360 people since October 7, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry.Deadly exchanges have occurred regularly between Israeli forces and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, whose deputy leader Naim Qassem has urged Israel not ""to expand its aggression"".
In western Iraq, a military base used by US-led coalition forces came under a barrage of missiles, a US defence source and an Iraqi police official told AFP.
Since mid-October, there have been dozens of attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria, the majority of them claimed by Tehran-aligned groups that oppose US support for Israel.

Blinken discusses sea route for Gaza aid with Cyprus president,"GAZA - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides on Sunday to discuss a maritime aid corridor from the island to the heavily bombarded and besieged Gaza Strip.
The talks came as the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said relentless Israeli bombing has killed more than 9,700 people in the Palestinian territory, mostly women and children.
Israel has said it will destroy Hamas after the Islamist group's October 7 attacks that Israeli officials say killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
Supplies of water, electricity, fuel and food were cut off to the impoverished and densely populated territory in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks.
Blinken and Christodoulides discussed the situation in the Middle East, government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
Their conversation at Larnaca airport included ""a dedicated, one-way maritime corridor of sustained flow of humanitarian aid from Cyprus to civilians in Gaza"", Letymbiotis said.
Earlier Sunday, Christodoulides said France, the European Commission and Israel backed Nicosia's initiative to open a humanitarian sea route.
""On that basis, we are talking with the United Nations because the UN will receive the aid and not Hamas so that it reaches the population,"" Christodoulides told reporters.
After raising the plan with European Union leaders last month, Christodoulides said he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Emmanuel Macron about the issue.He said Cyprus was taking the initiative as the nearest EU member state to the region -- the island is about 370 kilometres (230 miles) from Gaza -- and because of its good relations with Arab states and Israel.
""It is important that both the French president and the president of the (European) Commission have endorsed our initiative. We are working on the details so that it can be implemented,"" Christodoulides said.
He said ""we must be ready at any moment, and as soon as conditions allow it, to proceed with implementing this proposal"".
Asked whether there were discussions with Israel on a ceasefire to provide humanitarian aid, he said: ""Israel, the prime minister himself, is in favour of our initiative.""
""We are discussing the details... because the maritime area around Gaza does not allow for ships to approach.""
Last week, Cyprus Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos visited Jordan and the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
Christodoulides has also involved Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in the talks.
Cyprus already serves as a transit hub for foreign nationals evacuated from Israel because of the war.

Israel retakes Gaza border area as death toll mounts,"GAZA CITY - Israel said it recaptured Gaza border areas from Hamas on Tuesday, the fourth day of fierce fighting that has left thousands dead on both sides since the militants launched a surprise attack.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israel's military campaign following Saturday's onslaught is only the start of a sustained war to destroy Hamas and ""change the Middle East"".
Fears of a regional conflagration have surged ahead of an expected Israeli ground incursion into Gaza, the crowded, impoverished enclave from where Hamas launched its land, air and sea attack on the Jewish Sabbath.The death toll in Israel has surged above 1,000 following the worst attack in the country's 75-year history, while Gaza officials reported 900 people killed so far, and Israel's army said the bodies of roughly 1,500 militants had been found.
International NGOs issued a stark warning over the health and humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.
Hamas gunmen killed more than 100 people in the kibbutz of Beeri alone, said Moti Bukjin, a volunteer with the charity Zaka that recovers bodies in accordance with Jewish law.
United States President Joe Biden condemned the Hamas attacks as ""sheer evil"", and Netanyahu said the militants committed ""savagery never seen since the Holocaust"", including the beheading of soldiers.
Condemnation from Western leaders contrasted markedly with pro-Palestinian sentiment in the Arab world where people distributed sweets, danced and chanted prayers in support of ""resistance"" to Israel's long-standing occupation of Palestinian territories.
""My entire life, I have seen Israel kill us, confiscate our lands and arrest our children,"" said Farah al-Saadi, 52, a coffee vendor from Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank who praised the Hamas assault.The Israeli army has called up 300,000 reservists and massed tanks and other heavy armour both near Gaza and on the northern border with Lebanon, where exchanges of fire continued.
The military said its forces had largely reclaimed the embattled south and the border around Gaza, and dislodged holdout Hamas fighters from more than a dozen towns and kibbutzim.But late Tuesday in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, troops backed by helicopters and drones exchanged fire with several militants, leaving three fighters dead, the army said.
A new barrage of rockets was also fired from Gaza towards Ashkelon.
""Around 1,500 bodies of Hamas (fighters) have been found in Israel around the Gaza Strip,"" army spokesman Richard Hecht said earlier.
In Kfar Aza kibbutz, where Israeli forces say Hamas massacred more than 100 civilians, Israeli soldiers prepared to remove several of their compatriots in black body bags. 
 
- 'Blackmail' -
 
In a speech on Tuesday Biden confirmed at least 14 Americans were killed, and others were missing.
The US has sent an aircraft carrier and other warships to the eastern Mediterranean as part of efforts to deter an expansion of the conflict, and is also providing other assistance, including sharing intelligence with Israel.
Relatives of Americans believed held in Gaza called on the Biden administration to bring them home safely.Western powers and many other nations have reported citizens killed, abducted or missing. These include: Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Nepal, Panama, Paraguay, Russia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Ukraine.
Hamas has held around 150 captives since its ground incursion, among them children, elderly and young people captured at a music festival where around 270 died.
On Monday, Hamas warned it would start killing hostages every time Israel launches a strike on a civilian target in Gaza without warning. French President Emmanuel Macron called the threat ""unacceptable blackmail.""Hamas said the strikes killed two of its senior figures: Zakaria Muammar led its economics section, and Jawad Abu Shamala coordinated ties with other Palestinian factions.
Israel's army also announced their deaths.
Four Palestinian journalists were also killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza City, media unions and officials said.
Explosions again shook Gaza City on Tuesday night.
Earlier, for the third time in 24 hours, an Israeli air strike hit Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt, an AFP photographer and an NGO said.White smoke billowed from among fishing boats after an air strike on Gaza's port, and in Jerusalem the deserted streets were targeted by Hamas rocket fire.
""Israeli people they are scared of the Arabs and the Arabs are scared of the Jews... everybody is scared of each other,"" said Ahmed Karkash, a shop owner in the Old City.
In Gaza City, streets are clogged with rubble and littered with shards of glass.
Mazen Mohammad and his family slept on the ground floor of their apartment block, huddling together as explosions rang out around them.
What they woke up to the next day was unrecognisable.
""We felt like we were in a ghost town, as if we were the only survivors,"" Mohammad, 38, told AFP.Israel on Monday imposed a total siege on Gaza, which it has already blockaded for years, cutting off the water supply, food, electricity and other essential supplies.
European Union foreign ministers urged Israel not to cut such essentials, and called for humanitarian corridors for those trying to flee.
UN human rights chief Volker Turk said such sieges are prohibited under international humanitarian law.
Medical supplies, including oxygen, were running low at Gaza's overwhelmed Al-Shifa hospital, said Mohammed Ghonim, a doctor in the emergency room.
 
- Taken 'by surprise' -
 
The United Nations said more than 187,500 people had been displaced inside Gaza, most taking shelter in UN schools.Israel has been left reeling by Hamas's unprecedented ground, air and sea assault that began with thousands of rockets, likening it to the 9/11 attacks on the US.
In the aftermath, soldiers who were on guard duty along the hi-tech security barrier around Gaza recounted how the attack began with an effort to cripple observation cameras and communications.
""They took us by surprise and we weren't ready for it,"" a lookout soldier said in testimony posted on Instagram.
Israel faced the threat of a multi-front war after three days of clashes with militants on the northern border with Lebanon.
For the first time since the Hamas attack, there was an exchange of fire between Israel and forces in Syria, after Israel's military said munitions were fired towards the Golan Heights it has occupied since 1967. Mourners in the southern Lebanese village of Khirbet Selm carried two caskets, draped in yellow Hezbollah flags, with the bodies of two fighters it said were killed in Israeli strikes a day earlier. A third fighter was also killed, the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement said.
On Tuesday, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades claimed a fresh salvo of rocket fire from south Lebanon towards Israel, the Israeli army said, adding it retaliated with artillery fire.
""It's like a state of war,"" said Yaakov Regev, sipping coffee at a petrol station in northern Israel, a few kilometres from the Lebanon border.
Unrest has also surged in the West Bank, where 15 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday.
Netanyahu, the veteran leader at the helm of Israel's hard-right coalition, has called for an ""emergency government of national unity"" after his administration's proposal for judicial reforms split the nation and even its military this year, before the war brought the nation closer together.

Hundreds killed in Gaza hospital blast,"GAZA - A blast ripped through a Gaza hospital killing hundreds of people late Tuesday, sparking global condemnation and violent protests in several Muslim nations. 
Israel and Palestinians traded blame for the incident, which an ""outraged and deeply saddened"" US President Joe Biden denounced while en route to the Middle East.
Health authorities in Gaza said the explosion at the Ahli Arab Hospital killed between 200 and 300 people and was caused by the latest in a wave of Israeli airstrikes. Hamas said in a statement 500 had died. 
Israeli Defense Forces blamed Palestinian militants, saying an outgoing Islamic Jihad rocket misfired.
Neither account could be independently corroborated. 
With thousands of people killed in conflict and the situation worsening, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Wednesday for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"". 
On the ground in Gaza, there were scenes of chaos as the injured and dead were taken to nearby medical centres.
There, scores of bodies cloaked in blood-stained sheets and white plastic wrap lined the floors. Stunned relatives tried to identify loved ones.
""We were operating in the hospital. There was a strong explosion and the ceiling fell on the operating room,"" said Ghassan Abu Sittah, a doctor with the medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
""Hospitals are not a target,"" he said. ""This bloodshed must stop. Enough is enough.""
For 11 days, Israel has launched withering strikes on Hamas-controlled Gaza -- retaliation for the killing of 1,400 Israelis who were shot, mutilated and burned in October 7 cross-border raids.
Even amid the uncertainty over what caused the incident at the Christian-run hospital, there was rapid and widespread international condemnation.

Ramaphosa calls for protection of civilians and immediate ceasefire in Gaza,"JOHANNESBURG - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa accused Israel of war crimes and ""genocide"" in Gaza, as he chaired an extraordinary summit of the BRICS group of nations on Tuesday.
READ: Parliament to vote on cutting ties with Israel
Pretoria is hosting a virtual meeting of BRICS -- a group of major emerging economies that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- aimed at drawing up a common response to the Israel-Hamas conflict.
""The collective punishment of Palestinian civilians through the unlawful use of force by Israel is a war crime. The deliberate denial of medicine, fuel, food and water to the residents of Gaza is tantamount to genocide,"" Ramaphosa said.
Fighting has raged in Gaza after Hamas gunmen killed around 1,200 people, during cross-border raids on 7 October.
In retaliation, Israel launched a relentless bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza.
According to Hamas, the war has killed more than 13,300 people, thousands of them children.
On Tuesday, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said a truce agreement with Israel was in sight, with mediator Qatar adding negotiations to free hostages seized by the Palestinian Islamist group were at their ""closest point"" to a deal.
Addressing the BRICS summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping, called for an ""international peace conference"" saying there could be ""no sustainable peace and security in the Middle East without a just solution to the question of Palestine"".
China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinians and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
And it has this year sought to play a greater role in the Middle East, facilitating a historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran and sending an envoy to the region to push for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict.
 
- 'Clarion call' - 
 
BRICS, an acronym for its member countries, sees itself as a counterweight to the US and Western-led global order.
Ramaphosa called for an ""immediate and comprehensive ceasefire"" and the deployment of a UN force ""to monitor the cessation of hostilities and protect civilians.""
He also urged all countries ""to desist from fueling"" the conflict and stop supplying weapons to the warring parties.
""As individual countries, we have demonstrated our grave concern at the death and destruction in Gaza,"" he told the summit.  
""Let this meeting stand as a clarion call for us to combine our efforts and strengthen our actions to end this historical injustice."" 
South Africa has long been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party often linking it to its own struggle against apartheid.
Earlier this month, Pretoria recalled all its diplomats from Israel and last week it joined four other nations in calling for an International Criminal Court investigation into the conflict.
On Monday, Israel's foreign ministry said it had also recalled its ambassador to Pretoria for consultations.
The summit came as a delegation of foreign ministers of the Palestinian Authority, Indonesia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan are in Beijing this week for talks aimed at a ""de-escalation"" of the conflict.
The BRICS group is expected to issue a joint statement after the talks, which are being attended also by Russia's Vladimir Putin, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.

Gaza truce and hostage release to start Friday,"GAZA - A pause in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza will start on Friday morning and an exchange of hostages and prisoners will follow hours later, mediator Qatar said, after nearly seven weeks of fighting.
The breakthrough four-day truce facilitated by Qatar with help from Egypt and the United States had been due to take effect on Thursday but was delayed after a last-minute hitch.
Qatar said the pause would begin Friday at 7:00 am (0500 GMT) with the ""first batch"" of 13 civilian hostages -- all women and children from the same families -- being handed over around nine hours later.
Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails would also be released on Friday, Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari said, adding a list of names had been approved, without saying how many.
The agreement entailed a ""complete ceasefire with no attacks from the air or the ground"" and the skies clear of drones to ""allow for the hostage release to happen in a safe environment"", Ansari said. The armed wing of Hamas confirmed the cessation of hostilities would start at 7:00 am under the deal that is also intended to provide aid to Gaza's 2.4 million residents struggling to survive with shortages of food, water and fuel.
It said a total of 50 hostages -- females, and males aged 18 or under -- would be freed, with three Palestinian prisoners to be released for each of them.
At least 13 mothers are being held hostage in Gaza along with their 22 children aged 18 or under, according to an AFP tally. 
At least 19 others aged 18 and under, who were either kidnapped alone, with their fathers or with other family members, are also being held. 
The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was in contact with the families of the hostages after receiving ""a first list of names"" of those due to be released. It did not specify who was on it.
""We've already been on an emotional roller coaster for 47 days and today is no different,"" said Eyal Kalderon, a cousin of Ofer Kalderon, who is among those held captive in Gaza.
Asked if he expected kidnapped American toddler Abigail Mor Idan to be in the first batch of hostages to be released, US President Joe Biden said: ""I’m keeping my fingers crossed."" 
 
- 'Marathon negotiations' -
 Palestinian prisoners will be released from three jails in Israel and the occupied West Bank and taken to the Ofer military camp on buses, an Israeli official told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that they were expected to be freed in the evening.
Most are from the West Bank but five are from the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.
The truce deal follows weeks of war in Gaza after Hamas militants broke through the militarised border with Israel on October 7 in an unprecedented attack.
Israeli officials say about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and around 240 taken hostage.
The attack prompted a relentless Israeli campaign of bombing and a ground offensive in Gaza, where the Hamas government says more than 14,800 people, also mostly civilians, have been killed.
Governments around the world have welcomed the agreement, with some expressing hope it will lead to a lasting end to the war.""This cannot be just a pause before the massacre starts all over again,"" Riyad Mansour, Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council.
Israeli officials, however, say the truce will be only temporary.
""We are not ending the war. We will continue until we are victorious,"" Israel's chief of staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, told troops he visited in Gaza, according to the army.
 
- Fighting rages -
 
Instead of the expected pause, fighting raged on Thursday. Explosions were heard on an AFPTV livecam and heavy grey clouds hovered over the territory's north, much of which has been reduced to rubble.Israel's aerial bombardment continued on targets in the southern city of Khan Yunis, sending red and yellow fireballs and immense columns of black smoke into the air.
""I think there are still about 20 people under the rubble,"" said one Palestinian looking for survivors under a destroyed building east of Khan Yunis.
In Gaza's largest refugee camp Jabalia, a Palestinian doctor said at least 27 people had been killed and 93 wounded in a UN-run school where thousands of displaced civilians were sheltering.
The doctor blamed an Israeli strike. There was no immediate word from the Israeli military.Under pressure to back up its claims that Hamas had a command centre under Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital, Israel's military on Wednesday escorted journalists to a tunnel shaft which soldiers said was part of a vast Hamas underground military network.
The army led reporters into underground facilities with air-conditioning, a toilet and what looked like a kitchenette.
Hamas and medical staff have denied a command centre is under Al-Shifa, Gaza's largest hospital.

On Israel's northern border, Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah said it had stepped up its attacks from south Lebanon, where Israeli bombardments killed seven of its fighters, including members of an elite unit.Since the Israel-Hamas war began, deadly exchanges of fire across the border have killed  109 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters, and nine people in Israel, most of them soldiers, raising fears of a broader conflagration.
Thursday's exchange of fire came as Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian met with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah to discuss ""the efforts made to end the Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip"".Fatima Achour, a Palestinian lawyer in her 40s, burst into tears when she reached Egypt through the Rafah border crossing, becoming one of the few Gazans allowed to leave because she has a foreign passport.
""There's no city to go back to... There are no houses. Our lives have ended,"" she said. ""This truce is not for us.""

Muslim nations announce start of Ramadan in shadow of Gaza war,"RIYADH - The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins on Monday, Middle Eastern nations have announced, with the king of Saudi Arabia using the occasion to call for an end to the ""heinous crimes"" taking place in war-torn Gaza.
Saudi Arabia said through its official SPA news agency on Sunday that the Supreme Court had announced ""Monday, March 11, 2024, the beginning of the blessed month of Ramadan for this year"".
Speaking as custodian of Islam's two holiest sites, King Salman gave thanks in his Ramadan message on Sunday evening for the ""blessings bestowed upon the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"", but noted the war in Gaza would cast a shadow over the month of fasting and prayer.
""As we witness the arrival of Ramadan this year, our hearts are heavy with sorrow for the ongoing suffering of our Palestinian brothers facing relentless aggression,"" he said.
""We call upon the international community to uphold its responsibilities to put an end to these heinous crimes and ensure the establishment of safe humanitarian and relief corridors.""
Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam.
After the sighting of the crescent moon, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar also announced a Monday start for Ramadan through their own official news outlets.
Egypt's Islamic advisory body the Dar al-Ifta likewise confirmed Ramadan was beginning on Monday, as it was in the Palestinian Territories including Gaza, and in Algeria and Tunisia.
Their neighbours Morocco and Libya said Ramadan would start on Tuesday.Iran had earlier set the beginning of Ramadan for Tuesday after its ""Estehlal"" moon observation office said it had not been possible to observe ""the crescent of Ramadan"".
In Saudi Arabia, the start of the holy month had been cast into doubt after some of the kingdom's observatories reported that the moon was obscured by ""cloudy weather and dust particles"".
But final confirmation of the sighting came through the Al Majmaah University Astronomical Observatory in Riyadh.
As he announced Tuesday as the start of Ramadan in Jordan, the kingdom's Grand Mufti Ahmed Hasnat asked God to ""relieve the anguish of our oppressed people in Gaza"" and ""lift affliction and aggression from them"".
Oman will also mark the first day of Ramadan on Tuesday.
- 'Completely different' -
During Ramadan, observant Muslims refrain from eating and drinking from dawn to dusk, and traditionally gather with family and friends to break their fast in the evening.It is also a time of prayer, when the faithful converge in large numbers at mosques, especially at night.
The war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has cast a long shadow over festivities in the region, with hopes dashed that a ceasefire agreement could be reached before Ramadan began.
At a market in Rafah, the southern Gaza city where nearly 1.5 million people have sought refuge, Palestinians on Sunday bemoaned food shortages and wartime uncertainty hanging over the holy month. 
""Of course, this Ramadan is completely different from all the Ramadans that have gone before it,"" said Bassel Yassin, an agricultural engineer. 
Hassuna Tabib Hassnan, a dentist displaced from Gaza City in the north, said he didn't know how the month would end -- ""in our homes, in a tent, by the sea in the north or in the south"".
Hassnan added that instead of spending Ramadan in their homes, ""it is clear that we will live in displacement, pain and oppression"".
The war was triggered by the October 7 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel that resulted in about 1,160 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza, aimed at destroying Hamas, has killed at least 31,045 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.
The United Nations has warned that famine in the Palestinian territory is ""almost inevitable"" unless something changes in the war, with aid trickling in at levels far below the pre-war norm.
US President Joe Biden, leader of Israel's most important ally, also spoke of the suffering in Gaza in a message marking the start of the holy month.
""The sacred month is a time for reflection and renewal. This year, it comes at a moment of immense pain,"" he said. 
""As Muslims gather around the world over the coming days and weeks to break their fast, the suffering of the Palestinian people will be front of mind for many. It is front of mind for me,"" Biden added, vowing to step up aid into the besieged territory.
Shopping at a Riyadh mall, Saudi government employee Faisal, who preferred to give only his first name because of the sensitivity of the matter, said it was ""the worst Ramadan I have ever experienced in my life"".
The man, in his fifties, added: ""I feel ashamed as I shop for meat and chicken for my family, while the people of Gaza are in famine.""  ",Monday 11 March 2024 - 09:00am
ICJ genocide decision | UN rocked by Gaza scandal,"NEW YORK - United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres says he hopes all parties will duly comply with the ICJ's decision.

"Israel, Palestinian militants trade deadly fire over Gaza","WEST BANK - Israel's army and Gaza militants traded heavy cross-border fire Wednesday, with 20 Palestinians killed over two days amid the worst escalation of violence to hit the coastal territory in months.
Smoke billowed from the densely-populated coastal enclave after Israel announced it was targeting rocket launch sites of the militant group Islamic Jihad.
Gaza's health ministry said five people were killed, a day after Israeli strikes on the Palestinian territory left 15 dead.Sirens wailed in the Tel Aviv area warning of incoming rocket fire, an AFP journalist reported, and in communities close to the border according to the army.
An AFP journalist in Gaza saw dozens of projectiles fired, while in a joint statement Palestinian militant factions said ""hundreds of rockets"" were launched.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is ""ready for the possibility of an expanded campaign and harsh strikes against Gaza,"" in a meeting with local leaders near the coastal territory.
Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service said it had received no immediate reports of casualties.Israel's Iron Dome air defence system intercepted rockets above the coastal city of Ashkelon and elsewhere in the south, AFP photographers witnessed.
The latest violence comes a day after Israeli strikes on Gaza killed three top Islamic Jihad militants and 12 others, including four children, according to a health ministry toll.

- 'Tension and fear' -
Israel's military said Wednesday's strikes included firing on militants ""who were travelling to a rocket launch site in the city of Khan Yunis"" in southern Gaza.
Islamic Jihad had vowed Tuesday to retaliate, with Israel warning its residents near the border to stay near bomb shelters.
Ahead of Wednesday's exchange of fire, Gaza's usually bustling shops were closed.
People in Gaza ""expect the worst"", said resident Monther Abdullah, 50. ""Everyone feels anxious and people aren't on the street much. 
""I definitely feel like there's a war coming, and there's tension and fear, whether here or there.""The latest violence comes on the second anniversary of a devastating 11-day war fought between Gaza militants and Israel.
Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif Al-Qanou said Wednesday ""the strikes of the unified resistance are part of the process of responding to the massacre committed by (Israel).""
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are considered terrorist organisations by Israel and the United States.

- West Bank deaths -
Among those killed Tuesday were four children and three senior Islamic Jihad operatives.
The top militants were named as Jihad Ghannam, Khalil al-Bahtini and Tareq Ezzedine, a Gaza-based militant leader in the West Bank.
Earlier Wednesday, Israeli troops raided the West Bank town of Qabatiya, killing two people whom the army accused of firing at soldiers.
The Palestinian health ministry identified the two men as Ahmed Jamal Tawfiq Assaf, 19, and Rani Walid Ahmed Qatanat, 24.
The Israeli military said troops detained one person during the raid when soldiers were shot at from a vehicle.""The soldiers responded with live fire toward the two assailants and killed them,"" the army said.
Mourners including armed militants later carried the two men's bodies through the streets in a funeral procession.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since the Six-Day War of 1967 and its forces regularly operate in Palestinian cities.

- 'Barbaric' strikes -
The Arab League on Wednesday condemned the ""aggressive (and) barbaric Israeli raids on the Gaza Strip, which targeted civilians, children and women in residential neighbourhoods"".
The Gaza violence this week is the worst since a three-day escalation in August killed 49 Palestinians, with no Israeli fatalities.
Washington called for ""all parties to de-escalate the situation"".
While Hamas has fought multiple wars with Israel in recent years, the group stayed on the sidelines of last year's conflict fought between Israel and Islamic Jihad.Nineteen Israelis, one Ukrainian and one Italian have been killed over the same period, according to an AFP count based on official sources from the two sides.
These figures include combatants as well as civilians, and, on the Israeli side, three members of the country's Arab minority.

"Hamas says Gaza deaths top 25,000 as Israel pushes offensive","GAZA CITY - Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry on Sunday said the death toll in the war-torn Palestinian territory breached 25,000 as Israel pushed its southward offensive and renewed bombardment in the north.
Israel is pressing its push against Hamas in southern Gaza as it seeks to destroy the Islamist militant group responsible for the deadliest attack in the country's history.
In early January, Israel's military said the Hamas command structure in northern Gaza had been dismantled, leaving only isolated fighters.
But witnesses told AFP Israeli boats were bombarding Gaza City and other areas in the north early Sunday. Hamas has also reported heavy combat in the north.
""Dozens are still under the rubble,"" the Hamas government's media office said, adding that the dead and injured ""could not be transferred to hospitals due to the continued artillery shelling on... Khan Yunis and the Tal al-Hawa area in Gaza City and the north"".
The Israeli army said it ""eliminated a number of terrorists"" in the main southern city of Khan Yunis and killed 15 militants in northern Gaza over the past day.
Thick plumes of smoke billowed above Khan Yunis on Sunday morning, AFP journalists saw.
The October 7 attacks by Hamas resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Israel's relentless bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 25,105 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",Sunday 21 January 2024 - 14:40pm

Israel and Gaza at war after Hamas launches surprise attack," 
SDEROT - More than 200 Israelis died in a surprise large-scale attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Saturday, the army said, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to reduce the group's Gaza hideouts to ""rubble"".
Intense air strikes on the coastal enclave brought the Palestinian death toll to at least 232, Gaza officials said, with nearly 1,700 injured, following Hamas's massive rocket barrage and ground, air and sea offensive, in the conflict's bloodiest escalation in decades.
Gun battles raged into the night between Israeli forces and hundreds of Hamas fighters in at least 22 Israel locations, including at least two where gunmen were holding hostages, the army said.""Terrorists rampaged and broke into homes, massacring civilians,"" the army said, adding that more than 1,000 people in Israel were wounded by gunshots or the more than 3,000 incoming rockets.
""We are at war,"" Netanyahu told the stunned nation on Saturday morning, after Hamas had launched its multi-pronged attack at dawn, half a century after the outbreak of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.
""I'm telling the people of Gaza: get out of there now, because we're about to act everywhere with all our force,"" the premier said later. ""We'll strike them to the bitter end and avenge with force this black day they brought on Israel and its people.""""What happened today is unprecedented in Israel and I will see to it that it does not happen again.""
As the UN Security Council called an emergency meeting for Sunday, President Joe Biden voiced ""rock solid and unwavering"" support for the US ally and warned ""against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation"".
 
- 'So many bodies' -
 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also spoke to Egypt, a key intermediary between Israel and Hamas about the ""urgency in achieving an immediate halt"" to the fighting, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.
As night fell, the Israeli army said its forces were still engaged in live gun battles in a string of Israel locations, in an operation labelled ""Swords of Iron"", as reservists were being called up.The Israeli army launched air strikes into Gaza later in the night while militants fired rockets, an AFP journalist reported.
Hamas earlier released images of several Israelis taken captive, and another army spokesman, Daniel Hagari, confirmed that soldiers and civilians had been kidnapped.
""I can't give figures about them at the moment,"" he said, adding that Hamas would ""pay the price"" for the attacks.
Hecht said there was also a ""severe hostage situation"" in the Negev desert communities of Beeri and Ofakim east of Gaza.The Islamist group started the multi-pronged attack around 6:30 am (0330 GMT) with thousands of rockets aimed as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, some bypassing the Iron Dome defence system and hitting buildings.
Hamas fighters -- travelling in ground vehicles, motorised paragliders and boats -- breached Gaza's security barrier and attacked nearby Israeli towns and military posts, opening fire on residents and passersby.
""Send help, please!"" one Israeli woman sheltering with her two-year-old child pleaded as militants outside opened fire and tried to break into their safe room, Israeli media reported.Bodies were strewn on the streets of the Israeli town of Sderot near Gaza and inside cars, the windscreens shattered by a hail of bullets.
""I saw many bodies, of terrorists and civilians,"" one man told AFP, standing beside covered corpses on a road near Gevim Kibbutz in southern Israel. 
""So many bodies, so many bodies.""
AFP journalists witnessed Palestinian armed men gather around a burning Israeli tank, and others driving a seized Israeli military Humvee vehicle back into Gaza, where they were met by cheering crowds.
 
- 'Gates of hell' -
 Israeli army Major General Ghasan Alyan warned Hamas had ""opened the gates of hell"".
An AFP journalist in Gaza saw clouds of dust from the remains of bombed residential towers which Gaza's interior ministry said contained 100 apartments. 
Israel's military said it had warned residents to evacuate before targeting the multi-storey buildings used by Hamas.Israel's state-run electricity company cut the power supply to Gaza as army flares lit up the night sky.
The escalation follows months of rising violence, mostly in the occupied West Bank, and tensions around Gaza's border and at contested holy sites in Jerusalem.
Before Saturday, at least 247 Palestinians, 32 Israelis and two foreigners had been killed this year, including combatants and civilians, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.
Hamas labelled its attack ""Operation Al-Aqsa Flood"" and called on ""resistance fighters in the West Bank"" as well as in ""Arab and Islamic nations"" to join the battle.Its armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, claimed to have fired more than 5,000 rockets, while Hecht said Israel had counted more than 3,000 incoming rockets.
Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group was on the ""verge of a great victory"".
""The cycle of intifadas (uprisings) and revolutions in the battle to liberate our land and our prisoners languishing in occupation prisons must be completed,"" he said.
 
- 'Dangerous precipice' -
 
Air raid sirens wailed across southern and central Israel, as well as in Jerusalem. In Tel Aviv, a gaping hole was ripped into a building, with residents boarding a bus to flee to safety.
The conflict sparked major disruption at Tel Aviv airport, where many carriers cancelled flights. Schools will remain closed on Sunday, the start of the week in Israel.Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, leading to Israel's crippling blockade of the impoverished enclave of 2.3 million people.
Israel and Hamas have since fought several wars. The last major military exchange, in May, killed 34 Palestinians and one Israeli.
In northern Gaza on Saturday, hundreds of people fled their homes, carrying food and blankets, an AFP correspondent said.
Violence also erupted across the West Bank, including annexed east Jerusalem, with five Palestinians killed and 120 wounded in clashes with Israeli forces and settlers, Palestinian medical services said.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the attack ""terrorism in its most despicable form"".
But Hamas drew support from other foes of Israel, with Iran's supreme leader declaring he was ""proud"" and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah praising the ""heroic operation"".
UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland warned of ""a dangerous precipice"" and called on all sides to ""pull back from the brink"".

Ramadan brings no relief as Israel-Hamas war rages in Gaza,"Gaza's deadliest war showed no signs of abating as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began Monday amid a gruelling humanitarian crisis that has pushed much of the territory to the brink of starvation.
UN and aid groups say only a fraction of the supplies needed for Gaza's 2.4 million people have been allowed in since Israel placed it under near-total siege after the October 7 attack. 
As the Muslim world welcomed Ramadan with the customary daytime fast, many Gazans awoke to bombardment that saw residents once more search through the rubble of destroyed homes for survivors and bodies.""The start of Ramadan has been sad and covered in darkness, with the taste and stench of blood everywhere,"" said one displaced Palestinian man, Awni al-Kayyal, 50.
""The (Israeli) occupation does not want us to have any joy during Ramadan. We do not have any food for our iftar table,"" he said, referring to the fast-breaking evening meal. 
A Cyprus government spokesman said a Spanish charity ship with food aid was set to sail from the island within hours to the coastal Gaza Strip, where the UN has repeatedly warned of famine.The non-governmental group Open Arms said its boat would tow a barge with 200 tonnes of food, which its partner the US charity World Central Kitchen would later unload on Gaza's shores.
Fighting meanwhile raged on across Gaza, with the Israeli military reporting that troops killed 15 militants ""in close encounters, sniper file and air strikes"".It added that ""several Hamas operatives were arrested"" during raids on homes in southern Gaza, while witnesses reported violent clashes in several areas through the night.
Gaza's health ministry said at least 67 people were killed over the past 24 hours. 
The Hamas government media office said separately that more than 40 air strikes targeted homes in Khan Yunis, Gaza City and other areas.
 
- 'Immense pain' -
 Multiple countries airdropped aid into northern Gaza on Sunday, but the United Nations' aid coordinator for the area has said boosting supply by land would be far more effective.
Some of the food packages smashed open on impact, leaving residents picking through the dirt to salvage what they could, AFPTV images showed.
The war started by the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel has killed 31,112 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza.
Weeks of talks involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators failed to bring about a truce and hostage exchange deal ahead of the intended target of the start of Ramadan. Both sides have blamed each other for failing to reach a deal, after Israel demanded a full list of surviving hostages and Hamas called for Israel to pull out all its troops from Gaza.
A source with knowledge of the ceasefire talks told AFP ""there will be a diplomatic push especially in the next 10 days"" with a view to securing a deal within the first half of Ramadan.
The Islamic holy month this year is ""all pain"", said Ahmed Kamis, 40, in Gaza's far-southern city of Rafah, where around 1.5 million people have tried to find refuge but are still at risk from Israeli bombing.But even as many Palestinians did not know where to find their next meal, others still found ways to celebrate the start of the holy month, fashioning meagre decorations and distributing traditional fanous lanterns between their tents.
In Washington, President Joe Biden, who faces growing criticism for his steadfast support of Israel as the civilian death toll in Gaza soars, issued a statement marking the start of Ramadan.
""This year, it comes at a moment of immense pain,"" Biden said.
""As Muslims gather around the world over the coming days and weeks to break their fast, the suffering of the Palestinian people will be front of mind for many. It is front of mind for me.""
 
- 'Heinous crimes' -
 In Saudi Arabia, King Salman called in his Ramadan message for the international community to ""uphold its responsibilities to put an end to these heinous crimes"" in Gaza.
UN chief Antonio Guterres expressed his ""solidarity and support to all those suffering from the horrors in Gaza. In these trying times, the spirit of Ramadan is a beacon of hope, a reminder of our shared humanity.""
Responding to growing US and domestic pressure, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said most Israelis back ""the action that we're taking to destroy the remaining terrorist battalions of Hamas"".He said Israel's military had killed ""at least 13,000 terrorist fighters"", without detailing how the figure was derived.
Hamas's attack that started the war resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP count based on Israeli official figures.
The militants also took around 250 hostages, dozens of whom were released during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes that 99 hostages still in Gaza remain alive and 31 have died.What is available in the south is sold at exorbitant prices, residents say, making this Ramadan harder than any before.

Israel bombs Gaza as pressure mounts to protect civilians,"GAZA - Israel struck Gaza targets Sunday in its war on Hamas sparked by the October 7 attacks as international concern mounted over the spiralling civilian death toll on the third day of fighting after a truce ended.
More than 15,200 people have been killed in the besieged Palestinian territory, according to Hamas, in more than eight weeks of combat and heavy bombardment.
Israeli air and artillery strikes hit Gaza's northern frontier with Israel, throwing thick clouds of smoke and dust into the sky.
At least one rocket salvo fired from the territory at Israel was intercepted by air defence systems, said AFP reporters in Sderot near Gaza.The UN humanitarian agency OCHA said at least 160 Palestinian deaths were reported in two incidents in northern Gaza Saturday: the bombing of a six-storey building in Jabalia refugee camp, and of an entire block in a Gaza City neighbourhood.
Repeated bursts of heavy automatic weapons fire were heard over an AFPTV livecam.
Gaza's Hamas government on Saturday said 240 people had been killed since the week-long truce expired early Friday.
The war broke out when Hamas militants burst through Gaza's militarised border into Israel on October 7 and killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, while also taking around 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.
 
- 'No safe place' -
 
After the unprecedented attacks, Israel unleashed a relentless air and ground campaign that has killed mostly women and children in Gaza, authorities there say.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas, while the militant group has ruled out more hostage releases until a permanent ceasefire is agreed.
""We have said it from day one: the price to pay for the release of Zionist prisoners will be the release of all our prisoners -– after a ceasefire,"" Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas's politburo, said on Saturday evening.
Israel's army, after focusing on northern Gaza in recent weeks, has struck more targets in the territory's south and issued warnings to Palestinians trapped there to seek what it said would be safe zones, ""if required"".
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk warned that ""as a result of Israel's conduct of hostilities and its orders for people to leave the north and parts of the south, hundreds of thousands are being confined into ever smaller areas in southern Gaza"".""I repeat, there is no safe place in Gaza,"" he said.
Hamas and another militant group, Islamic Jihad, announced ""rocket barrages"" against multiple Israeli cities and towns including Tel Aviv, and Israel said two of its soldiers had died in combat, the first since the truce ended.
In a summary issued on Sunday, the military said a drone strike had ""eliminated"" five Hamas militants. 
Fighter jets and helicopters had also struck ""tunnel shafts, command centres and weapons storage facilities"" while naval forces hit Hamas vessels and weapons, it said.
At least seven people were killed in an Israeli bombing early Sunday near Gaza's southern border with Egypt, the Hamas government said.
 
- 'Too many' innocents killed -
 
Israel's ally the United States, which provides it with billions of dollars in military aid annually, has intensified calls for the protection of Gaza's civilians.""Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed,"" Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters at UN climate talks in Dubai.
In a new estimate, OCHA said around 1.8 million people in Gaza, roughly 75 percent of the population, had been displaced, many to overcrowded and unsanitary shelters.
Nasser hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis overflowed with both the wounded and the dead.
Jumana Murad said her son Mohammad, 19, was killed as he tried to help women and children out of a tent inside a school.""A piece of shrapnel hit him in the head,"" she told AFP before bursting into tears.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Sunday on X, formerly Twitter, that a WHO team visited Nasser hospital and found it with 1,000 patients, three times its capacity. 
Some were being treated on the floor, in conditions ""unimaginable for the provision of health care"", he said.
Gazans are short of food, water and other essentials, and many homes have been destroyed but the aid reaching them is ""a drop in the ocean of needs,"" said Adnan Abu Hasna, a spokesman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
 
- Surveillance -
 
The seven-day truce, brokered by Qatar with support from Egypt and the United States, led to the release of 80 Israeli hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
On Saturday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israeli negotiators were being withdrawn from Qatar ""following the impasse in the negotiations"".There are still 137 hostages held in Gaza, Israel's army said.
Britain's defence ministry confirmed at the weekend that it will conduct surveillance flights over Israel and Gaza ""in support of the ongoing hostage rescue activity"".
Israeli hostages released from Gaza talked publicly on Saturday for the first time, urging their government to secure the release of the remaining captives.
Pope Francis on Sunday deplored ""so much suffering in Gaza"", and urged those involved to reach a new ceasefire deal.
 
- 'Total victory' -
 
But Netanyahu said the war would continue ""until we achieve all its aims"" -- among them freeing the hostages -- and that soldiers had prepared during the truce ""for total victory against Hamas"".
""There is no way to win except by continuing the ground campaign,"" Netanyahu said, vowing that Israel would be ""observing international law"".
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday drew on his experience fighting the Islamic State group in urging Israel to protect non-combatants.
""The lesson is that you can only win in urban warfare by protecting civilians,"" he told a forum in California.At almost exactly the same time Israeli negotiators pulled out of the Qatar talks, bombs pounded the modern-looking yellow apartment blocks one by one.
Most Gazans are trapped, but an Egyptian border crossing, after a closure on Friday, reopened to enable 880 foreign and dual nationals to cross along with 13 injured people, the UN said.

Israel bombs south Gaza after Hamas hostage threat,"JERUSALEM - Israel bombed southern Gaza's main city on Monday after Hamas warned no Israeli hostages would leave the territory alive unless its demands for prisoner releases were met.
Hamas triggered the conflict when the group carried out the deadliest-ever attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza.
Israel has responded with a military offensive that has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed at least 17,997 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Israeli strikes on Monday hit the city of Khan Yunis, an AFP correspondent reported, while Palestinian militants Islamic Jihad said they had blown up a house where Israeli soldiers were searching for a tunnel shaft.The army reported rocket fire from Gaza into Israel on Monday, and said fierce fighting had taken place on Sunday around Gaza City and Khan Yunis.
Hamas on Sunday warned that Israel would not receive ""their prisoners alive without an exchange and negotiation and meeting the demands of the resistance"".
Israel says there are still 137 hostages in Gaza, while activists say around 7,000 Palestinians are in Israeli jails.
Months of intense bombardment and clashes have left Gaza's health system on the brink of collapse, with most hospitals no longer functioning and nearly two million people displaced.AFP visited the bombed-out ruins of the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City and found at least 30,000 people taking refuge amid the rubble after Israeli forces raided the medical facility last month.
""Our life has become a living hell, there's no electricity, no water, no flour, no bread, no medicine for the children who are all sick,"" said Mohammed Daloul, 38, who fled there with his wife and three children.
 
- 'Collapsing' health system -
 
The UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced from their homes -- roughly half of them children.
Israel had urged people to seek refuge in the south, but after expanding the war to include southern targets, there are few safe places for civilians to go.Humanitarian organisations continued to press Israel for greater protection of civilians in the conflict.
Mapping software deployed by Israel's army to try to reduce non-combatant deaths was condemned as inadequate Sunday by Lynn Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories.
""A unilateral declaration by an occupying power that patches of land where there is no infrastructure, food, water, health care, or hygiene are 'safe zones' does not mean they are safe,"" she said.
Only 14 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are functioning at any capacity, according to the United Nations' humanitarian agency OCHA.
""Gaza's health system is on its knees and collapsing,"" said World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, as the agency called for immediate, unimpeded aid deliveries.
Israel's army chief Herzi Halevi said Sunday his troops were using ""significant force"" in Gaza, hailing ""significant achievements"" in the war.The military said Sunday it had struck more than 250 targets in 24 hours, including ""a Hamas military communications site"", ""underground tunnel shafts"" in southern Gaza, and a Hamas military command centre in Shejaiya in Gaza City.
It says 98 soldiers have died and around 600 wounded in the Gaza war.
Some 7,000 ""terrorists"" have been killed, according to National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi.
""Hamas should not exist, because they are not human beings, after what I saw they did,"" Menahem, a 22-year-old soldier wounded on October 7, told AFP during a military-organised tour that did not allow him to give his surname.
 
- UN credibility 'undermined' -
 
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Sunday the Security Council's ""authority and credibility were severely undermined"" after the United States blocked a ceasefire resolution on Friday.""I can promise, I will not give up,"" Guterres told a leaders' gathering in Qatar.
Qatar, where Hamas's top leadership is based, said it was still working on a new truce like the week-long ceasefire it helped mediate last month that saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinian prisoners and humanitarian aid.
But Israel's relentless bombardment was ""narrowing the window"" for success, said Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday again rejected a ceasefire.
""With Hamas still alive, still intact and... with the stated intent of repeating October 7 again and again and again, that would simply perpetuate the problem,"" he told CNN.
But Blinken also said the United States was ""deeply, deeply aware of the terrible human toll that this conflict is taking on innocent men, women and children"".There are fears of regional escalation with frequent cross-border exchanges between Israel and Lebanese militants, and attacks by pro-Iran groups against US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria.
Syria's state news agency said Israel had carried out strikes near Damascus late Sunday, but air defence systems had prevented any significant damage.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the strikes had targeted Hezbollah sites in the Sayeda Zeinab district and near Damascus airport.
Meanwhile, Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels threatened to attack any vessels heading to Israel unless more aid was allowed into Gaza.
France said Sunday one of its frigates in the Red Sea had shot down two drones launched from Yemen.

"Battles, bombardment in Gaza as Israel reschedules talks with US","JERUSALEM - Battles and bombardment pounded the Gaza Strip on Thursday, after Washington said Israel agreed to reschedule cancelled talks with tensions worsening between the allies. 
United States criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has mounted over Gaza's civilian death toll, dire food shortages, and Israeli plans to push its ground offensive against Hamas militants into the far-southern city of Rafah, which is packed with displaced civilians.
World leaders have warned against a Rafah offensive which they fear would worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian situation for the Palestinian territory's 2.4 million residents. 
The United Nations reported late Wednesday that famine ""is ever closer to becoming a reality in northern Gaza,"" and said the territory's health system is collapsing ""due to ongoing hostilities and access constraints.""
Bombardment and fighting have continued despite a binding United Nations Security Council resolution passed on Monday demanding an ""immediate ceasefire"" in Gaza and the release of hostages held by militants.
Netanyahu scrapped an Israeli visit to Washington to discuss the Rafah plan, in protest of the UN ceasefire resolution from which the United States abstained, allowing it to pass. Netanyahu's government has since backtracked and agreed ""to reschedule the meeting dedicated to Rafah"", according to White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre.
She added that they were working to find a ""convenient date"".
US officials say they plan to present Israel with an alternative for Rafah, focused on striking Hamas targets while limiting the civilian toll.
 
- Air strike on hospital -
 
The war began when Hamas launched an unprecedented October 7 attack that resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
The militants also took about 250 hostages. Israel says that, after an earlier truce and hostage release deal, about 130 captives remain in Gaza, including 34 presumed dead.
Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 32,490 people, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.The health ministry, in a preliminary toll issued early on Thursday, said 66 people were killed overnight.
Fighting continued around three of the Strip's hospitals, raising fears for patients, medical staff and displaced people inside them.
The Al-Amal hospital in Khan Yunis, near Rafah, ""has ceased to function completely"", the Palestine Red Crescent said earlier this week, following the evacuation of civilians from the medical centre.
Israel's military accuses Hamas fighters of hiding in medical facilities and using civilians as shields.
Early on Thursday, the army said militants had been firing on troops ""from within and outside the emergency ward at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.
Troops began raiding Al-Shifa early last week, and on Wednesday night carried out an air strike on the emergency ward ""while avoiding harm to civilians, patients, and medical teams,"" the army said.
The UN has reported ""intensive exchanges of fire between the Israeli military and armed Palestinians"". It cited the health ministry as saying the army has confined medical staff and patients to one building, not allowing them to leave.
Israel's army said troops had evacuated civilians, patients and staff ""to alternative medical facilities"" it set up.
Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles have also massed around the Nasser Hospital, the health ministry said, adding that shots were fired but no raid had yet been launched.
The Red Crescent warned that thousands were trapped inside.
 
- Almost six months of war -
 
Gaza has endured almost six months of war and a siege that has cut off most food, water, fuel and other supplies.
Israel denies it is blocking food trucks but aid entering the Gaza Strip by land is far below pre-war levels -- around 150 vehicles a day compared with at least 500 before the war, according to UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
With limited ground access, several nations have begun aid airdrops, and a sea corridor from Cyprus delivered its first cargo of food.But UN agencies said these are no substitute for land deliveries.
Desperate crowds have rushed towards aid packages drifting down on parachutes, and Hamas on Tuesday said 18 people drowned or died in stampedes trying to recover airdropped aid.
Israel charges that Palestinian militants sexually assaulted October 7 victims and hostages.
The New York Times published the account of the first Israeli woman to speak publicly about having been sexually abused, 40-year-old lawyer Amit Soussana.
Soussana, who was abducted from her home and released in November, said she was repeatedly beaten and sexually assaulted at gunpoint by her guard inside Gaza.
Talks in Qatar towards a truce and hostage release deal, involving US and Egyptian mediators, have brought no result so far, halfway through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
 
- Death toll 'far too high' -
 
Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, before meeting visiting Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, stressed that ""the number of civilian casualties is far too high, and the amount of humanitarian aid is far too low"" in Gaza.
US criticism has mounted but President Joe Biden has made clear he will not use his key point of leverage -- cutting US military assistance to Israel, which amounts to billions of dollars.
Netanyahu, who leads a coalition including religious and ultra-nationalist parties, faces ongoing protests at home over his failure to bring home all of the hostages.
Alongside the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, violence has surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where medics and the army said three people were wounded in a gun attack Thursday that targeted a school bus.Lebanon's Hezbollah movement on Wednesday announced the deaths of eight of its members after a day of cross-border fire with Israel that left at least 16 people dead.
Israeli first responders said they pronounced a man dead in an Israeli border town, after Hezbollah rocket fire followed an Israeli strike on what its military called a ""military compound"" in southern Lebanon.

Mediator says Gaza truce 'not promising' as Israel rejects calls to spare Rafah,"DOHA - Mediator Qatar acknowledged that prospects for a new pause in Israel's war with Hamas were ""not really promising"" as Israel rejected appeals to hold off on a threatened assault on the Gaza city of Rafah.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that foreign countries calling on Israel to spare the city, where 1.4 million Palestinians have sought refuge, were effectively telling the country to ""lose the war"".
Truce efforts intensified this week as Qatar and fellow mediators Egypt and the United States scrambled to secure a ceasefire before Israeli troops enter Rafah, the last major population centre in Gaza untouched by Israeli ground troops.
Despite a direct appeal from US President Joe Biden earlier this week, Netanyahu insisted the operation would go ahead regardless of whether a hostage release deal was agreed with Hamas.
Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, who met with negotiators from both Israel and Hamas this week, said efforts for a ceasefire had been complicated by the insistence of ""a lot of countries"" that any new truce involve further releases of hostages.
""The pattern in the last few days is not really very promising,"" he said at the Munich Security Conference.
His assessment came as Hamas threatened to suspend its involvement in talks unless relief supplies are brought into the north, where aid agencies have warned of looming famine.""Negotiations cannot be held while hunger is ravaging the Palestinian people,"" a senior source in the Palestinian militant group told AFP, asking not to be identified as he is not authorised to speak on the issue.
Earlier, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh reiterated the group's demands, which Netanyahu called ""ludicrous"".
They include a complete pause in fighting, the release of Hamas prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.
Netanyahu also rejected pressure from some Western governments for unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state.
Israel said on Saturday it detained 100 people at one of Gaza's main hospitals after troops raided the complex, with fears mounting for patients and staff trapped inside.
At least 120 patients and five medical teams are stuck without water, food and electricity in Nasser Hospital in Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Israel has for weeks concentrated its military operations in Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas's Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, the alleged architect of the October 7 attack that triggered the war. ",Sunday 18 February 2024 - 05:55am
Gaza families return to homes in ruins,"GAZA - Tea and cheese sandwiches are on the breakfast menu for Taghrid al-Najjar's children. It should be an everyday moment, but their home in the Gaza Strip is now mostly rubble.

The walls have collapsed, with furniture and appliances buried under concrete.
Until the war, the 46-year-old mother had never left her farming village along the border with Israel in the southeast of the Strip.
Since Friday a truce has paused the fighting between Israel and Hamas, allowing them to return to a neighbourhood in ruins.
""It is only here that I feel good,"" she said.
Najjar fled when Israeli bombardments started as it went to war with Hamas in retaliation for the 7 October attacks that left 1,200 dead, according to the Israeli authorities.
For weeks she lived with nine members of her family in a Khan Yunis school converted into a makeshift camp for displaced people.The Hamas-led government says nearly 15,000 people have been killed in the Gaza war and Najjar said dozens of people in her wider extended family have died.
As soon as the truce went into effect on Friday -- it has now been extended for an additional two days -- she began making her way home to Abasan on foot.
""I discovered that my house had been completely destroyed -- 27 years of my life to build it and everything is gone!"" she said.
""For two days I couldn't eat, then I told myself that I had to continue living,"" she added, looking at her children.
""My house is destroyed but my children are alive, so we will rebuild. We have already done it once, we can do it again,"" she told AFP.
Each night the family squeezes through a window to sleep in the only room where the walls have not entirely crumpled.
 
- Children 'traumatised' -
 
Once there is a permanent ceasefire, Najjar said, they will pitch a tent, but only for ""long enough to rebuild the house"".Her 64-year-old neighbour Jamil Abu Azra's main concern was his four young grandchildren.
""They can sleep anywhere, the problem is that they are afraid and they are traumatised,"" he said.
""Even us adults are afraid, but we pretend in front of the little ones.""
Across the street, Bassem Abu Taaima contemplated the destroyed building where his family and his four brothers' families had lived.
""We are all farmers or taxi drivers. We really have nothing to do with the resistance,"" he said of Palestinian armed groups, ""so we don't understand why all this is happening to us.""
Wearing a jacket given to him by a neighbour, and shorts despite the biting cold, he said he will wait for the war to end before setting up a tent and starting to clear and rebuild.
He has scoured the debris for warm clothes, although everything he has found has been burned or torn.
 
- School destroyed -
 
Nearby, Naim Taaimat, 46, was building a shelter for his family from wood, some fabric and a few nails.
""This is where I will live with my wife, our seven children and my mother after the war,"" he said.
More tents will be needed as his brothers -- each has seven children -- ""have also lost their homes"", he added.
The brothers ""shed blood"" to build the houses where the families' possession are now buried under rubble.Taaimat's first priority was to find his daughter Nivine's trousseau, as she had been due to get married next week. He used a hammer to try to break up the concrete blocks before rummaging around with his bare hands.
""Now she's lost her house and her fiance also lost his house. So I have to find something so that she can still be a little happy.""
Twelve-year-old Abdessamad interrupted, running in shouting: ""We found an electric lamp and we have logs for the fire!""
Sitting with his friends on a dirt floor near the United Nations school where used to study, now partly wrecked by Israeli bombing, he laughed, sang and joked.
""The war really scared us and it was horrible, but there is good news,"" said his friend Nabil, eight.
Laughing, and hoping his parents couldn't overhear him, he explained: ""The school's destroyed and we won't be able to go back for a while.""

Israel says 'dozens' of militants killed in Gaza raids," 
JERUSALEM - The Israeli army said Monday that its forces killed dozens of militants in clashes through the night in Gaza as it presses on with its military response to the October 7 Hamas attacks.
The army said ""troops killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels and attempted to attack the troops"", and that a fighter jet had targeted a building ""with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside"".
Hamas earlier said it was engaged in ""heavy fighting"" with Israeli troops inside northern Gaza, where besieged residents were again told to flee.
After weeks of ferocious air strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared a new ""stage"" in what he warned will be a ""long and difficult"" war.
Israel's military released a series of images late Sunday purporting to show tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and equipment-laden infantrymen operating inside Palestinian territory.
Hamas said its Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades were already ""engaged in heavy fighting... with the invading occupation forces"".
The Israel Defence Forces claimed to have struck more than ""450 terror targets, including operational command centres, observation posts, and anti-tank missile launch posts"".The military also said 31-year-old sergeant Yinon Fleishman, a reservist, was killed in northern Israel when his tank overturned.
With a fierce urban war now feared in Gaza, Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari told Palestinian civilians to go south ""to a safer area"".
""We are gradually expanding the ground activity and the scope of our forces in the Gaza Strip,"" he said.
It is now more than three weeks since Hamas gunmen launched a wave of bloody cross-border raids against homes, communities, farms and security posts inside Israel.
An estimated 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 239 people were taken hostage, according to the latest Israeli tallies.
Grieving and enraged, Israel has vowed to free the hostages, track down those responsible and ""eradicate"" Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist movement that has governed Gaza since 2007.
But there is growing international concern about the toll of Israel's campaign on Gaza's 2.4 million residents.
The territory is under siege, with people unable to leave and only a trickle of humanitarian aid allowed in.
Meanwhile, Israel has carried out one of the most intense bombing campaigns in recent memory.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people, mainly civilians, have been killed, many of them children.
 
- Food, water, medicine -
 
Inside Gaza's maze of streets, rubble and hulled-out buildings, there is a growing sense of panic, fear and desperation.
Ibrahim Shandoughli, a 53-year-old from Jabaliya in northern Gaza, asked why he would head south when that area is also being bombed.
""Where do you want us to evacuate to? All the areas are dangerous,"" he said.
Etidal al-Masri was among those who did move south.
But even in the border town of Rafah, she still struggles to find even the basics amid shortages of food, water and medicine.
Gazans ""must now queue for bread, toilets and even for sleep"", she said.
On Sunday, the desperation appeared to boil over. The United Nations reported that ""thousands of people"" had ransacked its warehouses looking for tinned food, flour, oil and hygiene supplies.
The UN also reported that 33 trucks carrying water, food and medical supplies had entered Gaza from Egypt on October 29.
It is one of the largest deliveries to date, but still far short of the 100 trucks a day that aid groups say is needed.
International Criminal Court lead prosecutor Karim Khan warned Israel on Sunday that preventing access to humanitarian aid could be a ""crime"".
 
- 'Axis of resistance' -
 
In a phone call with Netanyahu on Sunday, US President Joe Biden also underscored the need to ""immediately and significantly"" increase the flow of aid.
And while the White House has welcomed the gradual return of cell phone and internet services that had been cut for days, it had a sharp warning for Israel's leaders.
The ""burden"" lies with Israel to distinguish between militants and innocent civilians in Gaza, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN.
According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders -- despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 of the displaced.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society has said evacuation is impossible and reported repeated strikes around Al-Quds hospital in central Gaza.
The head of the World Health Organization said calls to evacuate Al-Quds hospital were ""deeply concerning"".
""We reiterate -- it's impossible to evacuate hospitals full of patients without endangering their lives,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X.
Mohamed al-Talmas, who has taken shelter in Gaza's biggest hospital Al-Shifa, said ""the ground shook"" there with intense Israeli raids.
Israel describes Al-Shifa hospital as a de facto Hamas ""command centre"" and headquarters.Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi has warned Israel's ""crimes have crossed the red lines, which may force everyone to take action"".
Since Hamas's attack on October 7, Iran-backed groups have launched attacks from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria.
Skirmishes have intensified on the Israeli-Lebanese border with Iran-backed Hamas ally Hezbollah.
On Sunday militants in south Lebanon fired rockets towards Israel, which has responded with strikes.
The Israel Defense Forces also said they had ""struck military infrastructure in Syrian territory"" in response to launches ""toward Israeli territory."" 
 
- 'Psychological games' -Inside Israel, where shocked residents still face daily rocket attacks, much of the focus is on the hostages abducted by Hamas.
Hamas has released four prisoners and offered to release more as part of a swap for Palestinians detained in Israel.
It has also claimed ""almost 50"" hostages were killed by Israeli strikes -- a claim that was impossible to verify but has caused anguish to those praying for their loved ones to return. 
""We demanded that no action be taken that endangers the fate of our family members,"" said Meirav Leshem Gonen, the mother of hostage Romi Gonen.
Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant accused Hamas of playing ""psychological games"".
""Hamas is cynically using those who are dear to us -- they understand the pain and the pressure,"" he said.

Israeli military proposes 'plan for evacuating' Gaza civilians,"GAZA CITY - Israel's military proposed a plan for evacuating civilians from ""areas of fighting"" in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced Monday, after he said a ground invasion of the Palestinian territory's southern city Rafah was necessary.
Foreign governments and aid organisations have repeatedly expressed fears that an invasion of Rafah would inflict mass civilian casualties.
More than 1.4 million Palestinians -- most of them displaced from elsewhere -- have converged on the last Gazan city untouched by Israel's ground troops.
It is also the entry point for desperately needed aid, brought in via neighbouring Egypt. 
Israel's military ""presented the War Cabinet with a plan for evacuating the population from areas of fighting in the Gaza Strip, and with the upcoming operational plan"", a statement in Hebrew from Netayahu's office said Monday. 
The statement did not give any details about how or where the civilians would be moved. ",Monday 26 February 2024 - 09:30am
Hamas weighs Gaza truce as deadly fighting nears fifth month," 
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES - Battles raged in Gaza's south Sunday ahead of another visit to the region by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a bid to secure a new truce as the Israel-Hamas war approaches its fifth month.
Blinken set off Sunday on what is his fifth Mideast trip since the October 7 attack by Hamas that set off the crisis.
He is expected to begin his trip on Monday in Saudi Arabia before visits to Israel, Egypt and Qatar.
The health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said at least 127 people were killed in Israeli strikes in the previous 24 hours in the territory.
The Hamas government media office said a kindergarten where families were sheltering was hit in the southern border city of Rafah, which is teeming with Palestinians displaced by the war.
""There is no safe place in the Gaza Strip, from north to south,"" displaced man Mohammed Kloub told AFP in Rafah, which according to UN figures now hosts more than half of Gaza's population.Israel has warned its ground forces could advance on Rafah as part of its campaign to eliminate Hamas.
An AFP journalist reported strikes and tank fire on Khan Yunis, southern Gaza's main city, with some air raids also hitting nearby Rafah.
Israel's army said its forces had raided a Hamas training facility in Khan Yunis where militants prepared for the October 7 attack. 
The Al-Qadisiya compound contained models of Israeli military bases, armoured vehicles, as well as entry points to kibbutzim, the army said in a statement.
During the raid, the army ""neutralised"" several militants, it said.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said that at the nearby Al-Amal hospital there were ""alarming signs (of) a humanitarian disaster... after 14 days of continuous siege"".
 
- 'Hitting them hard' -
 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the army had ""destroyed 17 of 24 (Hamas) battalions. Most of the remaining battalions are in the southern Strip and in Rafah, and we will deal with them.""
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant meanwhile said: ""The pressure on Hamas is working, they are in a very difficult situation and we are hitting them hard."" 
With the war set to enter a fifth month on Wednesday, international mediators were pressing to seal a proposed truce deal thrashed out in a Paris meeting of top US, Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials.
French foreign minister Stephane Sejourne, on his first Middle East tour, met his counterparts in Egypt and Jordan, with Amman's foreign minister Ayman Safadi saying ""immediate international action"" was needed ""to stop the war in Gaza"".A top Hamas official in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan, said Saturday the group needed more time to ""announce our position"" on the truce deal.
Hamdan added that Hamas wanted ""to put an end as quickly as possible to the aggression that our people suffer"".
A Hamas source has said the proposal involves an initial six-week pause that would see more aid delivered into Gaza and the phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
 
 
- Gaza rendered 'unlivable' -
 
The war was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also seized around 250 hostages, and Israel says 132 remain in Gaza including at least 27 believed to have been killed.Vowing to eliminate Hamas, Israel launched a massive military offensive that has killed at least 27,365 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry.
Gazans have faced dire humanitarian conditions, and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on social media platform X that ""there is very limited access to clean water and sanitation amid relentless bombardment"".
Experts and rights groups told AFP that Israeli forces have destroyed buildings near the border in an attempt to create a buffer zone inside the Palestinian territory.
Israel has not publicly confirmed the plan, which Nadia Hardman, an expert on refugees at Human Rights Watch, said ""may amount to a war crime"".
""We are seeing mounting evidence that Israel appears to be rendering large parts of Gaza unlivable,"" she said.
Sejourne told his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry that he understood Cairo's concerns over ""forced displacement"" of Palestinians into Egypt from the Gaza Strip.
 
- 'Turmoil' across region -
 
Concern for hostages still in Gaza and security failures surrounding the October 7 attack -- the deadliest in Israel's 75-year history -- have led to criticism of Netanyahu and rallies against the government.Michal Hadas, protesting in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, told AFP she feared Israel's leaders were dragging out the conflict for political reasons, ""because as long as the war continues there will be no election"".
The war has also sent regional tensions soaring, with a surge in attacks by Iran-backed groups in solidarity with Gaza triggering counterattacks by key Israel ally the United States.
The United States and its partner Britain said they struck dozens of targets in Yemen late Saturday in response to repeated attacks on shipping by Iran-backed Huthi rebels.
A Huthi spokesman said the latest wave of air strikes ""will not pass without response and punishment"".
Iran said the attacks ""contradicted"" US and UK statements on preventing regional escalation, and Hamas warned the strikes would bring ""further turmoil"" to the Middle East.

Israel battles Hamas in war it says will last 'months',"JERUSALEM - Israel pressed its offensive in the Gaza Strip on Friday after telling key backer the United States that the war to crush Hamas will last ""more than several months"".
The war began after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
Vowing to destroy Hamas and bring home an estimated 240 hostages taken by militants into Gaza, Israel launched a massive military offensive that has left swathes of the besieged territory in ruins.
According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, the war has killed more than 18,700 people, mostly women and children.
Late Thursday in the southern city of Rafah near the Egyptian border, crowds of Palestinians used flashlights to search under the rubble of buildings for survivors following an Israeli strike.
""This is a residential neighbourhood, women and children live here, as you can see. This residential neighbourhood has been reduced to rubble,"" said Abu Omar, who is living in Rafah.
""Three missiles on a residential neighbourhood that has nothing to do with any militant activities.""Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops were engaged in fighting with militants in two districts of Gaza City late Thursday.
""There will be more tough battles in the days to come,"" he said.
 
- 'We will destroy them' -
 
While the United States has strongly backed Israel's response to the October 7 attacks, it has pressed its ally to do more to minimise civilian casualties.
On Thursday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met in Tel Aviv with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.
During their meeting, Gallant warned that Israel's fight with Hamas ""will require a period of time -- it will last more than several months, but we will win and we will destroy them"".
Speaking in Washington, US President Joe Biden urged Israel to take more care to protect civilians in Gaza.
""I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives -- not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful,"" said Biden, whose government has provided Israel with billions of dollars in military aid.
White House spokesman John Kirby, meanwhile, said Washington was ""not dictating terms"" to Israel and that the timeline given by Gallant was ""consistent"" with what Israeli officials had previously said.
Netanyahu on Thursday vowed to carry on ""until victory"", and Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said the war would continue ""with or without international support"".
Sullivan on Friday will head to the Israeli-occupied West Bank city of Ramallah for talks with Palestinian Authority leaders, a US official said on condition of anonymity.
The West Bank, which is ruled by the Palestinian Authority (PA), has seen a surge in violence since October 7. 
There, the Palestinian health ministry said 11 people had been killed since the Israeli military launched a raid in the city of Jenin and its refugee camp earlier this week.
The war in Gaza has led to increased popular support for Hamas in the West Bank, further weakening the internationally recognised PA.
 
- 'Desperate, hungry, terrified' -
 This week, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly supported a non-binding resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza, with Washington voting against.
The United Nations estimates 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, warned Gaza risked a ""breakdown of civil order"" as hunger and desperation drove people to seize humanitarian aid being delivered to the enclave. 
""Everywhere you go, people are desperate, hungry and are terrified,"" said Lazzarini, who recently returned from Gaza.
According to UN humanitarian agency OCHA's latest update on the situation in Gaza, more than a third of households in the territory are reporting experiencing severe hunger, while more than 90 percent are ""going to bed hungry"".
Adding to Gaza residents' desperation, mobile and internet communications were cut Thursday, according to Palestinian telecommunications company PalTel.
""We regret to announce that all telecom services in Gaza Strip have been lost due to the cut off of main fibre routes from the Israeli side,"" it said in a message on social media.
""Gaza is... blacked out again,"" PalTel said, with global network monitor Netblocks confirming the blackout.Hamas's media office described the blackout as a ""premeditated crime that deepens the humanitarian crisis"" by making it harder for rescuers to reach injured people.
 
- Huthi attack -
 
Even as the need for humanitarian assistance grows, aid distribution has largely stopped in most of Gaza, except on a limited basis in the Rafah area, according to the UN.
COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, said the military ""is enabling tactical pauses for humanitarian purposes"". 
One was taking place Thursday for four hours in a Rafah neighbourhood to allow civilians to restock supplies such as food and water, it said.
Fears of a wider regional conflagration persist, and Yemen's Huthi rebels on Thursday claimed responsibility for an attack on a cargo ship through a Red Sea strait that is key to world shipping.According to a US official, the missile missed, though the Iran-backed rebels said the Maersk Gibraltar container ship was ""targeted with a drone and the hit was direct"".
Huthi spokesman Yahya Saree said the attack was intended as retaliation for the ""oppression of the Palestinian people"".

Militants took around 250 hostages during the bloody October 7 attacks that touched off the war, and around 132 are still in Gaza, including at least 27 believed to have been killed.
The fate of those remaining in captivity has gripped Israeli society, while a broader humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory marked by the threat of famine and disease has fuelled international calls for a ceasefire.
In a statement to the official Qatar News Agency (QNA), Doha on Tuesday announced a deal ""between Israel and (Hamas), where medicine along with other humanitarian aid is to be delivered to civilians in Gaza... in exchange for delivering medication needed for Israeli captives in Gaza"".
Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majid Al-Ansari told QNA the medicine and aid would leave Doha on Wednesday for the Egyptian city of El-Arish before being transported to the Gaza Strip.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed the deal.
Forty-five hostages are expected to receive medication under the agreement, according to the French presidency. After the drugs arrive at a hospital in the southern Gaza border town of Rafah on Wednesday, it said, they will be received by the International Committee of the Red Cross, divided into batches and immediately transferred to the hostages. 
Hamas released dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel during a November ceasefire mediated by Qatar, which hosts the group's political office.
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday he was ""hopeful"" that Qatar-brokered talks could lead to another such deal ""soon"".
 
- 'Nothing but remains' -
 
The war in Gaza began with Hamas's unprecedented October attack that resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
At least 24,285 Palestinians, about 70 percent of them women and children, have been killed in Gaza in Israeli bombardments and ground operations since, according to the territory's health ministry.The ministry reported early Wednesday that another 81 people were killed in overnight strikes, including in the main southern city of Khan Yunis.
The United Nations says the war has displaced roughly 85 percent of Gaza's 2.4 million people, many of whom have been forced to crowd into shelters and struggle to get food, water, fuel and medical care.
Just before midnight on Tuesday, witnesses reported strikes on the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis, sparking panic among the hundreds of displaced people seeking shelter there.
Earlier in the day, residents of the city sifted through the rubble from strikes as trucks and carts stacked high with displaced families' possessions rolled down the street.
""You can see the destruction. This room was inhabited by people, this one was inhabited by 20 children, women and men, and the same thing goes for the neighbouring houses in the whole camp,"" resident Mohamad Ramadan told AFP, gesturing at a destroyed home where he said several people had been killed.
""These men can still find some of their body parts, nothing but remains torn apart,"" he added. 
In Tel Aviv, anti-war protesters scuffled with police on Tuesday night, as some held up signs reading ""End the siege"" and ""Stop the genocide"".
""The occupation leads to bloodshed, and it continues incessantly. The children growing up now in Gaza are the ones who will confront us in a few years,"" protester Chava Lerman told AFP.""Civilians are getting killed by the Israeli bombings,"" said fellow protester Michal Sapri. ""It leads to nothing. Our hostages are still there. We're not going to release them (through) more military power.""
The Israeli public has kept up intense pressure on Netanyahu's government to secure the return of the hostages, with officials repeatedly insisting military pressure is necessary to bring about any kind of deal.
On Tuesday, an Israeli kibbutz confirmed that two hostages whose deaths were announced by Hamas in a video had been killed in Gaza.
 
- Strikes around region -
 
Meanwhile, fears of an all-out war across the Middle East have continued to mount, with violence involving regional allies of Iran-backed Hamas -- considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union -- surging since the war began.
The US military said it carried out fresh strikes in Yemen on Tuesday after the country's Huthi rebels claimed another missile attack on a cargo ship in the Red Sea.
It came just days after the United States and Britain bombed scores of targets inside Huthi-controlled Yemen in response to attacks by the rebels, who say they are targeting Israeli-linked shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity with Gaza.
US media reported that Washington would on Wednesday re-designate the Huthis a terrorist group, after previously dropping the classification in 2021.
Also on Tuesday, Israel's army hit Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon, with a security source saying the strikes were ""the most intense"" on a single area since the Hamas-aligned militants first began exchanging cross-border fire with Israel after the start of the war in Gaza.
Meanwhile, Iran -- which backs both the Huthis and Hezbollah -- carried out a missile attack in Iraq's Kurdistan region against what its Revolutionary Guards alleged was an Israeli spy headquarters and a ""gathering of anti-Iranian terrorist groups"".""We are already in a regional war... even though it's still at a low simmer,"" said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group.

'Intensive battles' continue in Gaza as UN chief calls on donors to maintain aid,"Heavy fighting raged in Gaza Sunday amid a fierce row over the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees that has called its future into question.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called on donor states to guarantee the flow of vital aid to Gaza after several halted funding to the agency, UNRWA, over Israeli claims that some of its staff participated in the October 7 attacks.
The Israeli army on Sunday said special forces were continuing to engage in ""intensive battles"" in Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis, where it said troops eliminated ""terrorists and located large quantities of weapons"".
Strikes were also carried out in central and northern Gaza, it added.
As heavy fighting sent more people fleeing south towards the Egyptian border, the row over the UNRWA aid agency for Palestinian refugees deepened. 
UNRWA said on Friday it had fired several employees over Israel's unspecified accusations about the involvement of some of its staff in Hamas's October 7 attack.
Donors including Germany, Britain, Italy, Australia and Finland on Saturday followed the lead of the United States, which said it had suspended additional funding to the agency over the accusations.
""While I understand their concerns -- I was myself horrified by these accusations -- I strongly appeal to the governments that have suspended their contributions to, at least, guarantee the continuity of UNRWA's operations,"" Guterres said late Saturday.
He said the ""abhorrent alleged acts"" of some UNRWA staff should not mean that its thousands of other humanitarian workers should be penalised.
""The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met,"" he said.
Israel's envoy to the UN slammed Guterres, saying the UN chief had repeatedly ignored ""evidence"" presented to him regarding UNRWA's involvement in ""incitement and terrorism"".
""Any country that continues to fund UNRWA before a comprehensive investigation of the organisation should know that its money will be used for terrorism,"" Gilad Erdan said Sunday.
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called on UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini to quit after saying earlier the body ""must be replaced with agencies dedicated to genuine peace and development"".
""Mr Lazzarini please resign,"" Katz said on X, formerly Twitter, late on Saturday, in response to a post by the UNRWA chief warning that the funding cuts meant the agency's operation in Gaza was close to collapse.
 
- UN shelter hit -
 
Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages and Israel says around 132 of them remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead captives.
Israel's ensuing military offensive has killed at least 26,422 people, most of them women and children, in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
Long-strained relations between Israel and UNRWA deteriorated rapidly after the UN body condemned tank shelling it said had hit a shelter for displaced people in Khan Yunis on Wednesday.
It said the tank shelling killed 13 people at the shelter where tens of thousands of displaced people had been registered.The Israeli military has promised a thorough review but has also said it was examining the possibility it was a ""result of Hamas fire"".
The Israeli army is the only force known to operate tanks in the Gaza Strip.
There were heavy clashes in Khan Yunis overnight, including mortar rounds fired by militants at Israeli tanks, the armed wings of militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said.
Rockets were also fired into southern Israel, they said, and there was fighting in several neighbourhoods of Gaza City and further north.
The Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel, where aid is inspected and sent into Gaza, was blocked Sunday by protesters including the families of hostages, said COGAT, the Israeli agency in charge of civilian affairs in the Palestinian territory.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing growing domestic pressure over his handling of the conflict, doubled down on his vow to eliminate Hamas from besieged Gaza.
""If we don't eliminate Hamas terrorists... the next massacre is only a matter of time,"" he said in a televised statement on Saturday.
Experts have told AFP Netanyahu's target of eliminating Hamas is increasingly seen within his war cabinet as incompatible with returning the hostages held in Gaza.
 
- Ceasefire sought -
 
The UNRWA row follows the UN's International Court of Justice ruling on Friday that Israel must prevent possible acts of genocide in the conflict, and allow in more aid, although it stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.Diplomatic efforts to find a solution have also gathered pace.
CIA chief William Burns is to meet his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts, as well as Qatar's prime minister, in Paris soon to seek a ceasefire, a security source told AFP.
A week-long cessation of hostilities in November saw Hamas release dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
The New York Times said on Saturday US-led negotiators were getting closer to an agreement under which Israel would suspend its war in Gaza for about two months in return for the release of more than 100 hostages.
Quoting unidentified US officials, it said negotiators had developed a draft agreement that would be discussed in Paris on Sunday.
Palestinians are meanwhile fleeing further south from Khan Yunis towards Rafah, close to the Egyptian border, where the United Nations says most of Gaza's estimated 1.7 million displaced people have gathered.AFP images showed people wading through ankle-deep water around plastic shelters in Rafah, where bombardment still threatens.
The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) aid group has said surgical capacity at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis was ""virtually non-existent"".
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said the Al-Amal hospital was also ""under siege with heavy gunfire"".",Sunday 28 January 2024 - 14:00pm
Palestinians feel 'no joy' as Israel bombs Gaza on Christmas,"Palestinians said they felt ""no joy"" this Christmas as Israel bombed Gaza on Monday, with no end in sight to the war that Hamas says has claimed more than 20,000 lives.
Festivities were effectively scrapped in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, revered as the birthplace of Jesus Christ, with few worshippers or tourists on the usually packed streets.
In the besieged Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run ministry of health said early Monday Israeli strikes had killed at least 18 people in the southern city of Khan Yunis, the centre of recent fighting.
At a hospital in the city, Fadi Sayegh -- whose family has previously received permits to travel to Bethlehem for celebrations -- said he would not be celebrating Christmas this year.
""There is no joy. No Christmas tree, no decorations, no family dinner, no celebrations,"" he said while undergoing dialysis. ""I pray for this war to be over soon.""Sister Nabila Salah from the Catholic Holy Church in Gaza -- where two Christian women were killed by an Israeli sniper earlier this month according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem -- struck a sombre tone.
""All Christmas celebrations have been cancelled,"" she told AFP. ""How do we celebrate when we are... hearing the sound of tanks and bombardment instead of the ringing of bells?""
The war broke out when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel on October 7 and killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, and seized 250 hostages, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas in response and its military campaign, which has included massive aerial bombardment. The campaign has killed 20,424 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.Pope Francis kicked off global Christmas celebrations on Sunday with a call for peace.
""Our heart goes to Gaza, to all people in Gaza but a special attention to our Christian community in Gaza who is suffering,"" the Catholic leader said.
 
- Christmas eve strike -
 
Just ahead of Christmas, the Hamas-run health ministry said at least 70 people were killed in an Israeli air strike on Sunday at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza.Health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said the ""toll is likely to rise"" as many families were thought to be in the area at the time of the strike.
In a separate incident, the ministry said 10 members of one family were killed in an Israeli strike on their house in the Jabalia camp in northern Gaza.
AFP was unable to independently verify either toll.
Vast areas of Gaza lie in ruins and its 2.4 million people have endured dire shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine due to an Israeli siege, alleviated only by the limited arrival of aid trucks.
Eighty percent of Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN, many fleeing south and now shielding against the winter cold in makeshift tents.
The head of the UN refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, called for an end to the suffering.""A humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is the only way forward,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""War defies logic and humanity, and prepares a future of more hatred and less peace.""
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also renewed calls for a ceasefire, saying: ""The decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy.""
 
- 'No choice' -
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday the war was exacting a ""very heavy price"", as the death toll of soldiers killed in the conflict continued to mount.
""But we have no choice but to keep fighting,"" he said, adding: ""This will be a long war.""
The army said Monday two more soldiers had been killed, taking to 17 the number of troops killed since Friday and 156 since Israel’s ground assault began on October 27.
Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus indicated that forces were close to gaining control in northern Gaza and that now ""we focus our efforts against Hamas in southern Gaza"".The two men were among hundreds detained by Israeli forces over alleged links with Hamas during Israel's ground offensive.
About 20 men released from Israeli custody ""have bruises and marks of blows on their bodies"", Marwan al-Hams, hospital director in the southern city of Rafah, told AFP.",Monday 25 December 2023 - 07:10am
Cyprus says second aid ship ready to leave for Gaza,"A second ship loaded with aid for Gaza could depart as early as Saturday, Cyprus said, as the first vessel returned from the war-ravaged territory after successfully delivering its cargo. 
The Jennifer was set ""to depart for Gaza today or tomorrow,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Theodoros Gotsis told state radio.
US charity World Central Kitchen said the Jennifer had been loaded with 240 tonnes of food but that rough weather made it hard to predict when it would set sail for Gaza or when the first vessel, the Open Arms, might make a return trip.
""Maritime weather reports show bad weather from Sunday until end of next week —- so exact timing of sailing for either boat to return to Gaza is not available at this time,"" the charity said in a statement.
The maritime aid corridor from Cyprus is meant to at least partly address stark shortages in Gaza after more than five months of war, as UN agencies warn of looming famine.
Earlier on Saturday, World Central Kitchen said its team had finished unloading food and other desperately needed supplies from the barge towed by Spanish aid vessel Open Arms, which left Cyprus on Tuesday in a trial run for the aid corridor.
""All cargo was offloaded and is being readied for distribution in Gaza,"" World Central Kitchen said in a statement, noting it included ""almost 200 tonnes of food"".
The cargo on the Jennifer includes ""pallets of canned goods and bulk product -- including beans, carrots, canned tuna, chickpeas, canned corn, parboiled rice, flour, oil and salt,"" the charity said.
It also includes a forklift and a crane to assist with deliveries, it said.
The United Arab Emirates has sent ""a special load of 120 (kilogrammes of) fresh dates,"" it added.
Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides told reporters that Open Arms ""has begun to return"" to Cyprus ""and we are ready to send the second ship with humanitarian aid to Gaza.""
The Spanish charity that owns the first vessel, also named Open Arms, said it would get back to Cyprus on Sunday and could participate in future aid deliveries.
 
- A first 'test' -
With the humanitarian situation in Gaza increasingly dire, donors have pursued alternatives including airdrops and maritime shipments.
World Central Kitchen built a makeshift jetty southwest of Gaza City to receive Friday's shipment but US troops are on their way to build a larger pier.
The Israeli military said troops had secured the area around the jetty while the Open Arms shipment was unloaded. It said it had inspected the cargo before delivery.
World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres said on X that the first shipment was ""a test"" and that ""we could bring thousands of tonnes each week.""
The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 31,553 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.",Saturday 16 March 2024 - 19:50pm
Hundreds more foreign nationals flee Gaza as bombing toll mounts,"RAFAH - Hundreds more foreigners and dual nationals fled war-torn Gaza for Egypt on Thursday as Israeli forces kept bombing the besieged Palestinian territory where thousands have died.
READ: Hundreds of wounded, foreigners hope to flee war-torn Gaza
Wael Abu Mohsen, spokesman for the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing, said about 100 foreign nationals had been able to leave.
A total of 400 foreign passport holders as well as 60 severely wounded Palestinians in ambulances were due to cross by the end of the day, he said, and Egyptian officials later reported the first arrivals.AFP reporters in Rafah saw cars inside the crossing point and trucks being inspected.
The evacuation marks a tiny proportion of the 2.4 million people trapped in Gaza under weeks bombardment since Hamas launched a bloody cross-border attack into Israel on October 7.Egyptian officials have said they hope to help evacuate 7,000 foreigners from more than 60 countries from the densely crowded territory, as international calls for a ceasefire mount.
Ground battles flared again overnight in northern Gaza as Israeli troops seek to destroy Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the territory. 
Hamas' assault on October 7, which Israel says claimed 1,400 lives, was the bloodiest in the country's 75-year-history.
 
- 'Whole families killed' -
 The Israeli army is also seeking to free around 240 hostages, both civilians and troops, captured by Hamas during the attacks.
On Thursday, the military said it had killed dozens of enemy fighters.
""IDF fighters continue to advance in the Gaza City area and conduct face-to-face battles with Hamas terrorists and deepen the fighting,"" military spokesman Daniel Hagari told journalists. 
Some 332 soldiers have already died in the October 7 attacks and in the Israeli offensive they triggered.Global concern has risen sharply over Israel's response, in which the army says it has struck more than 12,000 targets so far. 
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 9,000 people have died, mostly women and children.
The United States and several Western countries back Israel in ruling out a ceasefire for now, arguing that it must have the right to defend itself against Hamas.
But President Joe Biden said he would support a humanitarian ""pause"" to help get the hostages out of Gaza.The long-blockaded coastal strip has been under a total Israeli siege that has cut off water, food, electricity, fuel and medical supplies.
A total of 227 aid trucks have so far entered under a US-brokered deal, according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, an amount aid groups say falls far short of meeting basic needs.
Special concern has focused on repeated heavy strikes on Gaza's largest refugee camp -- densely populated Jabalia, north of Gaza City -- where explosions brought down residential buildings.
Gaza's Hamas-ruled government said 195 were killed in two days of Israeli strikes on Jabalia, a figure AFP could not independently verify.
Hamas said seven of the estimated 242 hostages it is holding, died in Tuesday's bombings, a claim that was also impossible to verify.
 
- 'Death every day' -
 Israel has sought to justify the first Jabalia attack by saying it had targeted a senior Hamas commander in a tunnel complex below the camp.
AFP has witnessed rescuers desperately clawing through the rubble and twisted metal in frantic attempts to bring out survivors and bodies.
Emergency responders say ""whole families"" have died.
The wounded were rushed away by cart, motorcycle and ambulance as anguished wails and blaring sirens filled the dusty air.
But Gaza's hospitals have been overwhelmed and run short of medical supplies and even electricity. 
More than 20,000 people in Gaza are wounded, according to aid group Doctors Without Borders.
Israel has argued it is trying to avoid civilian casualties and has told residents to evacuate northern Gaza. It also says Hamas has blocked many civilians from leaving.While the United States and other Western powers have largely backed Israel, anger has flared across the Arab and Muslim world.
Jordan has recalled its ambassador to Israel ""to condemn the Israeli war that is killing innocent people in Gaza"".
Israel has also drawn fire from Iran-backed enemy forces, including Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon and Huthi rebels in distant Yemen. 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will embark on another Middle East tour from Friday.

Hamas weighs Gaza truce as deadly fighting nears fifth month,"Israeli strikes across Gaza killed scores overnight as battles raged Sunday in the besieged territory's south and Hamas was reviewing a proposal for a halt in the nearly four-month-long war.
France's top diplomat Stephane Sejourne began his first Middle East trip as foreign minister, aimed at pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release, a ministry spokesman said, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also expected in the region in the coming days.
The health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory said overnight Israeli strikes had killed at least 92 people.
An AFP journalist reported strikes and tank fire on Khan Yunis, southern Gaza's main city, with some air raids also hitting further south in Rafah, a border city teeming with Palestinians displaced by the fighting since early October.
Israel has warned its ground forces could advance on Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of people seeking refuge from the fighting shelter in makeshift encampments.The army said Sunday its troops raided ""a compound used by the commander of Hamas's Khan Yunis brigade"" and seized weapons, also confirming air and naval strikes on the city.
It reported several militants had been killed after attempting to attack Israeli troops.
With the war set to enter a fifth month on Wednesday, international mediators were pressing to seal a proposed truce deal thrashed out in a Paris meeting of top US, Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials.
- Gaza rendered 'unlivable' -
But a top Hamas official in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan, said on Saturday that the proposed framework was missing some details.
The group needed more time to ""announce our position"", Hamdan said, ""based on... our desire to put an end as quickly as possible to the aggression that our people suffer"".A Hamas source had said the proposal involves an initial six-week pause that would see more aid delivered into the Gaza Strip and exchanges of some Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.
The war was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also seized around 250 hostages, and Israel says 132 remain in Gaza, including at least 27 believed to have been killed.
Vowing to eliminate Hamas, Israel launched a massive military offensive that has killed at least 27,365 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry.
Rafah, once home to 200,000 people, now hosts more than half of Gaza's population, the United Nations said.
""We are exhausted,"" said displaced Gazan Mahmud Abu al-Shaar, urging ""a ceasefire so that we can return to our homes"".Experts and rights groups told AFP that Israeli forces have systematically destroyed buildings near the border in an attempt to create a buffer zone inside the Palestinian territory.
Israel has not publicly confirmed the plan, which Nadia Hardman, a refugee rights expert at Human Rights Watch, said ""may amount to a war crime"".
""We are seeing mounting evidence that Israel appears to be rendering large parts of Gaza unlivable,"" she said.
Adi Ben Nun, a professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University who has carried out an analysis of satellite imagery, said more than 30 percent of structures inside Gaza with a kilometre of the Israeli border have been damaged or destroyed during the war.
- 'Price goes up' -
Concern for hostages still in Gaza and security failures surrounding the October 7 attack -- the deadliest in Israel's 75-year history -- have led to criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and rallies against the government.
Michal Hadas, protesting in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, told AFP she feared Israel's leaders were dragging out the conflict for political reasons, ""because as long as the war continues there will be no election"".At a rally for hostages' families, Carmit Palty Katzir, sister of captive Elad Katzir, called for swifter action.
""Every second a deal is not closed, the price goes up. The number of hostages who won't return alive goes up. The number of soldiers risking their lives without a clear plan for the day after goes up,"" she said.
The war has sent regional tensions soaring, with a surge in attacks by Iran-backed groups in solidarity with Gaza triggering counterattacks by key Israel ally the United States.
The United States and its partner Britain said they struck dozens of targets in Yemen late Saturday in response to repeated attacks on shipping by Iran-backed Huthi rebels.
A Huthi spokesman said the latest wave of air strikes ""will not deter us"", while Tehran said the attacks contradicted ""the repeated claims of Washington and London that they do not want the expansion of war and conflict in the region"".

Pope calls for end to Gaza war as world celebrates Christmas,"ROME - People donned Santa caps on beaches, ski slopes and streets around the globe on Monday to celebrate Christmas, as Pope Francis called for an end to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine that this year have cast a shadow over one of the world's favourite holidays.
READ: 'Tonight our hearts are in Bethlehem,' pope says in Christmas mass
Red and white Santa outfits appeared on surfers from Australia to Florida, on bicyclists in the smog-filled streets of New Delhi and intrepid souls braving chilly Channel waters for a holiday dip near Britain's Dover.
In his annual Christmas Day ""Urbi and Orbi"" mass at the Vatican, Pope Francis called for an end ""to war, to every war, to the very mindset of war, an aimless voyage, a defeat without victors, an inexcusable folly"".May peace ""come in Israel and Palestine, where war is devastating the lives of those peoples"", he said.
""I reiterate my urgent appeal for the liberation of those still being held hostage. I plead for an end to the military operations with their appalling harvest of innocent civilian victims, and call for a solution to the desperate humanitarian situation by an opening to the provision of humanitarian aid"", he said.
""I implore peace for Ukraine. Let us renew our spiritual and human closeness to its embattled people"", he said, also calling for the resolution of conflicts simmering in the Middle East, Africa and the Caucasus.The Gaza war made for a sombre Christmas in Bethlehem, the biblical city in the occupied West Bank where Christians believe Jesus Christ was laid in a manger after being born more than 2,000 years ago.
The town did away with its giant Christmas tree, marching bands and flamboyant nativity scene that normally draw tourists, settling for just a few festive lights.
In the centre of town, a huge Palestinian flag had been unfolded with a banner declaring that ""The bells of Bethlehem ring for a ceasefire in Gaza"".
""A lot of people are dying for this land,"" said Nicole Najjar, an 18-year-old student.
""It's really hard to celebrate while our people are dying.""Inside Gaza, the horrid conditions were driving ""rising desperation due to acute hunger,""  World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday.
The Gaza war started after a Hamas attack on October 7 left around 1,140 people dead in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest official Israeli figures.
The Palestinian militants also abducted around 250 people, 129 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.
Israel retaliated with a sustained bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, that has killed more than 20,400 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.
 
- New Christmas Day -
 
Ukraine, invaded by Russia nearly two years ago, this year is celebrating Christmas on December 25 for the first time, jettisoning the traditional Orthodox date of January 7, which is feted in Russia.""We believe that we really should celebrate Christmas with the whole world, far away, far away from Moscow. For me that's the new message now,"" said one smiling parishioner in Odesa, Olena, whose son is a medic on the front line.
The date change -- moving away from the Julian calendar favoured by the Orthodox Church -- is part of numerous moves since the invasion to remove traces of the Russian and Soviet empires.
The Ukrainian military said that it had shot down 28 of the 31 drones that Russia launched on Christmas day at its neighbour, with no casualties reported.
 
- Surfing Santas -
 
In countries not afflicted by war, festive revellers opened presents and donned the red and white Santa hats for a shot of holiday cheer.In Sydney, Australia, residents and tourists headed to the beach to enjoy the heat of the Southern Hemisphere's summer.
In Florida, thousands descended on Cocoa Beach for the annual ""Surfing Santas"" celebration that raises funds for a charity helping cancer patients travel for treatment and the local surf museum.
In Sri Lanka, the president granted an amnesty to more than 1,000 convicts across the country to mark Christmas, prison officials said.
 
- Prayers in Turkey -

""I hope that their souls are here, I am certain that our prayers rise to them,"" he said in front of the ruins of a church at Antakya.
Twenty kilometres (12 miles) down the coast in Samandag, a generator powered the lights on a tree in front of the Saint-Ilyas church, which survived.""They say that with the birth of the child Jesus, a new life begins, a new beginning. For us too, here, it will be a new beginning,"" he said.

Race to rush aid to Gaza as EU warns hunger 'a weapon of war',"RAFAH - Donor nations, aid agencies and charities pushed on with efforts Wednesday to rush food to war-torn Gaza by land, air and sea after the EU top diplomat said starvation had become ""a weapon of war"".
READ: Aid ship sails to Gaza as Israel-Hamas war grinds on
The Israel's bombardment of Gaza has been raging since 7 October has caused mass civilian deaths, reduced vast areas to a rubble-strewn wasteland and sparked warnings of looming famine in the Palestinian territory of 2.4 million people.
A Spanish charity vessel, the Open Arms, was on its way to Gaza from Cyprus, where it had set sail early Tuesday towing a barge with 200 tonnes of aid, in a first voyage meant to open a maritime corridor.The flow of aid trucks from Egypt into Gaza has slowed recently -- a trend variously blamed on Israel and its security checks of cargo, and on civil unrest in Gaza where desperate crowds have looted aid shipments.
About half a dozen Arab and western nations have airdropped food parcels on parachutes into Gaza, and Morocco has sent a planeload of relief supplies via Israel's Ben Gurion airport.
The UN World Food Programme, trying an alternative land route from southern Israel, sent an initial six aid trucks Tuesday into worst-hit northern Gaza, through a gate in the security fence, the Israeli army said.The WFP said it had ""delivered enough food for 25,000 people"" and demanded that, ""with people in northern Gaza on the brink of famine, we need deliveries every day. We need entry points directly into the north.""
The European Union's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that the humanitarian crisis ""is man-made"".
""If we look at alternative ways to provide support, it's because the land crossings have been artificially closed,"" he said, charging that ""starvation is being used as a weapon of war"".
- 'War on children' -
The Gaza war was sparked by the October 7 Hamas attack that resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP count based on official Israeli figures.The militants also took about 250 hostages, dozens of whom were released during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes about 130 captives remain in Gaza but that 32 of them are dead.
Israel's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive have killed 31,272 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.
At least 88 people were killed over the past 24 hours, it said, adding that ""dozens of missing persons are still under the rubble"".
The Israeli army said its troops were ""intensifying operations"" in the southern Gaza Strip, including the biggest city there, Khan Yunis.
""In the last 24 hours, there were exchanges of fire between IDF (Israeli army) troops and a terrorist cell consisting of seven terror operatives barricaded inside a compound in the Hamad area of Khan Yunis,"" it said.""In a coordinated strike, the troops killed several of the terrorists, and then directed an aircraft to strike and eliminate the rest of the cell. Weapons were also located in the area.""
Weeks of talks involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators had aimed to bring a truce and hostage release deal before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, but missed the Monday deadline.
Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said that, although talks continued, ""we are not near a deal"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has doubled down on his pledge to ""destroy Hamas"" -- including by sending troops into Gaza's last area so far spared ground operations, far-southern Rafah.In a speech delivered via video link to a pro-Israel lobby group in the United States, he pledged that ""we will finish the job in Rafah while enabling the civilian population to get out of harm's way"".
The prospect of a Rafah invasion has sparked global alarm because it is crowded with almost 1.5 million people displaced, many sheltering in camps of makeshift tents.
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, called for an immediate ceasefire and branded the conflict ""a war on children"".
- Maritime corridor -
Gaza's dire food shortages after more than five months of war and siege have killed 27 people through malnutrition and dehydration, most of them children, according to the Gaza health ministry.As aid agencies warn the truck deliveries and airdrops fall far short of meeting the desperate need, European nations and the United States have announced plans to send more relief goods by sea.
US President Joe Biden last week announced plans for the military to build a pier on Gaza's coast, and four US Army vessels left a base in Virginia on Tuesday carrying about 100 soldiers and equipment.
The offshore platform and pier are expected to be up and running ""at the 60-day mark"", US Army Brigadier General Brad Hinson told journalists.Cypriot Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos said Tuesday that ""if all goes according to plan... we have already put in place the mechanism for a second and much bigger cargo"".
""And then we'll be working towards making this a more systematic exercise with increased volumes.""

Israel-Hamas truce enters final day with talk of extension,"ISRAEL - The truce between Israel and Hamas entered its final 24 hours Monday, with the militant group saying it was willing to extend the pause after it freed more hostages, including a four-year-old orphaned by its attack.
The pause that began Friday has seen dozens of hostages freed, with over 100 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in return.
Attention now has turned to whether the truce will be extended before its scheduled end early on Tuesday morning.
""That's my goal, that's our goal, to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into those in need in Gaza,"" US President Joe Biden said Sunday.
He said he would like the fighting to be paused for ""as long as prisoners keep coming out.""
""I get a sense that all the players in the region are looking for a way to end this so the hostages are all released and... Hamas is completely no longer in control of Gaza.""
Hamas has signalled its willingness to extend the truce, with a source telling AFP the group told mediators they were open to prolonging it by ""two to four days"".
""The resistance believes it is possible to ensure the release of 20 to 40 Israeli prisoners"" in that time, the source close to the movement said.
Under the truce, 50 hostages held by the militants were to be freed over four days in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners. A built-in mechanism extends it if at least 10 Israeli captives are released each extra day.
One potential complicating factor is the fact that some hostages are believed to be held by groups other than Hamas. Israel faces enormous pressure from the families of hostages, as well as allies, to extend the truce to secure more releases.
""It would be good, helpful and necessary"" to extend the truce until all hostages, who include French nationals, are freed, French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna told BFMTV on Sunday.
Three successive days of hostage releases have buoyed spirits in Israel, with tearful reunions weeks after Hamas militants poured across the border on October 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials.
In response, Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas, killing nearly 15,000 people, mostly civilians and including thousands of children, according to Gaza's Hamas government.
The third group of hostages released Sunday included a four-year-old American citizen called Abigail whose parents were both murdered in the Hamas attacks.
""What a joy to see her with us. But on the other hand, what a pity that she returns to the reality of not having parents,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
""She has no parents, but she has a whole nation that embraces her,"" he added.
Also among those freed Sunday was an 84-year-old woman who was rushed to intensive care in critical condition ""after serious neglect,"" medical officials said.Thirteen hostages were freed under the terms of the truce on Sunday in exchange for 39 Palestinian prisoners, who have been received by rapturous crowds waving Palestinian and Hamas flags.
Hamas separately freed three Thai nationals and a Russian-Israeli citizen, Ron Krivoy, who the group said was released ""in response to the efforts of Russian President Vladimir Putin"" and his ""support of the Palestinian cause"".
 
- Mounting pressure -
 
Israel has faced mounting pressure to extend the pause mediated by Qatar, the United States and Egypt, though its leaders have been keen to dismiss any suggestions of a lasting halt to the offensive.
""We continue until the end -- until victory,"" Netanyahu said in Gaza on Sunday, on the first visit by an Israeli premier since 2005.
His office has proposed a war budget of 30 billion shekels ($8 billion) for 90 days.Wearing green military fatigues and surrounded by soldiers, Netanyahu vowed to free all the hostages and ""eliminate Hamas"", in footage posted online by his office.
""Nothing will stop us, and we are convinced that we have the power, the strength, the will and the determination to achieve all the war's goals,"" he said.
Elsewhere in Gaza, residents picked through heaps of rubble where homes once stood searching for belongings after weeks of bombardment.
""I came to see if there was anything left, if there was anything I could salvage. We fled with nothing,"" said Ous sama al Bass, inspecting the ruins of his home in Al-Zahra, south of Gaza City.
""Everything is lost,"" he said. ""We're tired. That's enough. We can't take it anymore.""
On the outskirts of Gaza City, families took to the road on foot to head south, pushing luggage and relatives in wheelchairs, and carrying children in their arms.Israel has told Palestinians in Gaza to leave the north for the relative safety of the south, but it has now sent text messages to those in the southern city of Khan Yunis warning it knows hostages are being held there.
""The army will neutralise anyone who has kidnapped hostages,"" the message said.
The UN estimates that 1.7 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced by the fighting.
The pause in fighting has allowed more aid to reach Palestinians struggling to survive with shortages of water and other essentials.
Bbut Adnan Abu Hansa, a spokesman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), warned of ""unprecedented"" humanitarian needs.
""We should send 200 lorries a day continuously for at least two months,"" he said.

US says Putin seeking to 'take advantage' of Israel-Hamas war,"WASHINGTON - The United States accused Russian President Vladimir Putin Tuesday of trying to use the Israel-Hamas war to reduce Western support for Ukraine, which it said requires continued backing from Washington to prevent Russian success.
Hamas militants carried out a shock cross-border attack from Gaza this month that Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people, prompting Washington to rush military aid to Israel and sparking fears in Kyiv that backing for its war against invading Russian forces could suffer.
""Putin is very much trying to take advantage of the Hamas attack on Israel in the hopes that it will distract us... and that it will result in the United States pulling back its resources"" from Ukraine, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a Senate hearing on supplemental national security funding.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned during the same hearing that Putin will succeed in his bid to seize Ukrainian territory if the United States halts support for Kyiv.
""I can guarantee you that without our support, Putin will be successful,"" Austin said. ""If we pull the rug out from under them now, Putin will only get stronger and he will be successful in doing what he wants to do in acquiring his neighbor's sovereign territory.""
Washington is by far the biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine, committing some $43.9 billion since Russian forces invaded in February 2022 -- assistance that has helped Kyiv regain ground seized by Moscow.
But opposition from hardline Republican lawmakers has put future assistance for Kyiv in doubt, and the US government has had to rely on previously approved aid in the absence of new funding from Congress.
- Protests during hearing -
Blinken said a halt to US aid for Ukraine could encourage other countries to follow suit.""This is an instance where we've seen very significant burden-sharing that would almost certainly go away if we go away,"" he said.
""The message it would send... to each and every one of these countries is that the United States is abandoning ship -- well, we may as well do, too.""
Blinken also told the hearing that the Palestinian Authority should retake control of the Gaza Strip from Hamas, with international players potentially filling a role in an interim.
""At some point, what would make the most sense would be for an effective and revitalized Palestinian Authority to have governance and ultimately security responsibility for Gaza,"" he said, referring to the narrow coastal strip that Hamas has ruled since 2007.
Israel's retaliatory bombardment following the October 7 Hamas attack has killed more than 8,500 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, sparking widespread anger in the region and around the world.
The hearing was repeatedly interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters, some of whom cried out ""Ceasefire now,"" ""Palestinians are not animals"" and ""Shame on you all"" before being removed from the room.
Some two dozen people also raised hands covered in paint in a symbol of the bloodshed in the Gaza Strip, while several wore messages of ""Free Gaza"" written on their arms and held signs demanding ""No more $$$ 4 Israel.""

Israel army chief says war with Hamas will last 'many more months',"Israel's army chief warned its war with Hamas will last ""many more months"" as the military stepped up strikes inside the Gaza Strip, where more than 20,000 people have already been reported killed.
Concerns over a spiralling humanitarian crisis inside the besieged territory have amplified calls for an end to the hostilities, while incidents linked to Iran-backed groups acting in solidarity with Hamas have fanned fears of a wider regional conflict.
On Tuesday, the United States reported shooting down a barrage of drones and missiles over the Red Sea fired by Yemen's Huthi rebels.
But Israel's leaders have repeatedly vowed to keep up their offensive until Hamas is destroyed, and army chief Herzi Halevi signalled there would be no quick end to the war.
""This war's objectives are essential and not simple to achieve,"" Halevi said on Tuesday night. 
""Therefore, the war will continue for many more months.""  
The war erupted when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on October 7 and killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
During the attack -- the deadliest in Israel's history -- Hamas also took around 250 hostages, of whom 129 remain inside Gaza, Israel says.
Israel retaliated with a relentless bombardment and a siege followed by a ground invasion. The campaign has killed at least 20,915 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll issued by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.
 
- 'I've borrowed everything' -
 Since the siege went into effect, Gaza's 2.4 million people have been suffering severe shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine, with only limited aid entering the territory. An estimated 1.9 million Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN.
In the southern city of Rafah, where many displaced people have sought refuge, hundreds turned up at the Abdul Salam Yassin water company on Tuesday carrying baskets, pulling handcarts and even pushing a wheelchair stacked with bottles to queue for clean water.
""This was my father's cart,"" said Rafah resident Amir al-Zahhar. ""He was martyred during the war. He used it to transport and sell fish, and now we are using it to transport fresh water.""
Elsewhere in the city, people split logs and stacked kindling as the lack of fuel forced them to burn wood for cooking and to keep warm.
One woman took advantage of the sunshine on Tuesday to wash her family's clothes by hand, telling AFP: ""I've pleaded with people for water. I have absolutely nothing. I've borrowed everything, even the blankets, from others.""
The UN Security Council, in a resolution last week, called for the ""safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale"".
It requested the appointment of a UN humanitarian coordinator to oversee and verify third-country aid to Gaza, and on Tuesday Sigrid Kaag, the outgoing Dutch finance minister, was named to the post.
The resolution, which did not call for an immediate end to the fighting, effectively leaves Israel with operational oversight of aid deliveries.
 
- 'Gravely concerned' -
 Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said Tuesday that troops were ""fighting in the southern Gaza Strip in the area of Khan Yunis, and we have expanded the combat to the area known as the central camps"".
Three more Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza on Tuesday, bringing the total to 161 since its ground invasion began on October 27, the military said.
The UN Human Rights Office said it was ""gravely concerned about the continued bombardment of Middle Gaza by Israeli forces"", particularly after the military ordered residents to move to the central and southern regions.
France, a staunch Israeli ally, also said it was concerned by Israel's vow to intensify and prolong the fighting.
Violence has also flared across the occupied West Bank since the war began.
An Israeli operation in a refugee camp in the north of the West Bank left six people dead early Wednesday, according to the Palestinian ministry of health.
More than 300 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers since the war erupted, according to the ministry.
 
- Regional sparks -
 
The impacts of the war have also reverberated throughout the region, with armed groups backed by Israel's arch-foe Iran escalating activity.
US military forces shot down more than a dozen attack drones and several missiles fired by Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels at shipping in the Red Sea, the Pentagon said, reporting no damage or injuries.
The Huthis had claimed a missile strike on a vessel in the Red Sea and a drone attack towards Israel, their latest such actions in solidarity with Gaza.
Israel's military said one of its fighter jets had intercepted ""in the Red Sea area a hostile aerial target that was on its way to Israeli territory"".
Egyptian broadcaster Al-Qahera News reported that a flying object was struck about two kilometres (1.2 miles) from the seaside town of Dahab. The town lies around 125 kilometres south of Eilat on the southern tip of Israel, the closest target for Yemen's rebels.
In Iraq, the US military launched strikes on pro-Iran groups it has blamed for numerous attacks on US and allied forces during the Israel-Hamas war. An anti-tank missile fired by Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement wounded nine soldiers, Israel's military said, while Hezbollah announced the death of two of its fighters.
The incidents come after an Israeli strike in Syria on Monday killed Razi Moussavi, a senior commander in the Quds Force -- the foreign arm of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).",Wednesday 27 December 2023 - 06:53am
"At the gates of Gaza, Egypt's perilous balancing act","Since the Gaza war broke out in October, Egypt has faced a difficult dilemma, seeking both to show solidarity with the Palestinians and to preserve its relations with neighbouring Israel.
The Rafah crossing point between Egypt and Gaza is in theory the besieged territory's only opening to the world that is not under direct Israeli control.
In practice, Israel retains control over all goods passing through the crossing, including humanitarian aid intended for Gaza, which is suffering dire food shortages that the UN fears will spark ""starvation"".
Regularly, voices are raised to demand that Egypt open its border to the Palestinians, and Israel accuses it of doing too little.
""Lie,"" replies the spokesperson for the Egyptian state, Diaa Rachwan, who points to ""deliberate obstruction"" by the Israeli army.Only around 14,000 trucks have been able to enter the Gaza Strip so far, according to the UN, five times fewer than before the start of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7.
Dima Alsajdeya, researcher at the College de France, explained that ""on the ground Egypt obeys the orders of the Israelis. It sometimes tries to negotiate but ends up respecting the conditions imposed by the Israelis"", including painstaking inspections which lead to delays.
On at least five occasions, Israeli airstrikes or artillery fire hit the terminal, interrupting the flow of aid trucks.
- Ready for 'all scenarios' -
Egypt, which with Qatar and the United States, helped broker a week-long truce and hostage-for-prisoner exchange in late November, only speaks out clearly on one subject: humanitarian aid.
Since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave orders on February 8 for the army to begin preparations for an offensive on Rafah, Egyptians have voiced fears of the catastrophic scenario they warned against from the start of the war: a forced displacement of Palestinians to Sinai.
Egyptian officials say they are ready for ""all scenarios"" but refuse to comment on the possible consequences of an assault on Rafah, presented by Israel as the final blow against Hamas in response to the October 7 attack on Israel.
Nearly 1.5 million Palestinians crowded into the city fear the worst, but ""if Palestinians are deported to the Sinai, Egypt fears they will disperse across its territory and wants to contain them in an area developed in advance,"" said Alsajdeya.Satellite images seem to confirm this.
Officials and experts have reported a 13 square kilometre enclosure to shelter ""more than 100,000 people"", according to the Wall Street Journal.
Egyptian officials formally deny this, but two local business leaders confirmed to the NGO Sinai Foundation for Human Rights that they had won contracts to build a closed area ""surrounded by seven-metre-high walls"".
Israel officially denies any ""intention to evacuate Palestinian civilians"" into Egypt, even as several government ministers have openly called for the displacement of all Gazans.
Arab countries strongly oppose the idea of creating new Palestinian refugees because those who were driven out or fled during the 1948 war that accompanied Israel's creation and are still campaigning for their ""right of return"".
And Egypt, the only Arab country bordering Gaza, has an additional concern in mind: it fears Hamas, close to its enemy the Muslim Brotherhood, entering its territory.
- 'Cornerstone of stability' -Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty in 1979 and, ""for reasons of military and security coordination, neither the Egyptians nor the Israelis want a suspension,"" said Alsajdeya.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant recently stressed that ""we respect and value our peace agreement with Egypt, a cornerstone of stability in the region and an important partner"".
""This peace treaty has survived"" all the upheavals of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, added Alsajdeya, and since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, Egypt has never summoned the Israeli ambassador to Cairo nor called into question diplomatic ties.
Even when Egypt accused Israel of seeking to ""legitimise its attempt to occupy the Philadelphi Corridor,"" a road that runs along its border with Gaza, it contented itself with a written statement.
While thousands of tonnes of aid are piling up at Egypt's El-Arish airport, the international community is now counting on a maritime aid corridor between Cyprus and Gaza.
There too, ""a security check corresponding to Israeli standards"" will be put in place, making Gazans fear yet more lengthy delays.

"'If we bathe, we won't drink': Gazans struggle as water supplies dwindle","In the southern Gaza Strip, scores of people line up at bathrooms, many of them not having showered for days after Israel cut off water, electricity and food following Hamas's deadly assault.
Ahmed Hamid, 43, fled Gaza City with his wife and seven children, heading to Rafah after the Israeli army on Friday warned residents of the north of the enclave to head south ""for their own safety"".
""We haven't showered in days. Even going to the toilet requires waiting your turn in a line,"" Hamid told AFP. 
""There is no food. All goods are not available and the costs of what is available have surged. The only foods we find are tuna cans and cheese.
""I feel like a burden, unable to do anything.""
The UN estimates that about one million people have been displaced since Israel began a relentless aerial bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's deadly assault on October 7.
The Hamas attack left more than 1,400 people dead on the Israeli side, most of them civilians.
On the Gazan side, at least 2,670 have died in the relentless bombing, the majority of them ordinary Palestinians.
Israel also cut off all water, electricity and food supplies to the densely-populated coastal enclave, before resuming water to the south on Sunday.
Mona Abdel Hamid, 55, left her home in Gaza City, heading for her relatives' house in Rafah. 
Instead, she found herself in the home of people she did not know.""I feel humiliation and embarrassment. I'm looking for refuge. We don't have a lot of clothes and most of them are dirty now, with no water to wash them,"" she said.
""No electricity, no water, no internet. I feel like I'm losing my humanity.""
 
- 'Lives in displacement' -
 
Since Friday, Sabah Masbah, 50, has lived with her husband, daughter and 21 other relatives at a friend's home in Rafah.""The worst and most dangerous thing is that we can't find water. None of us bathe now because the water is so scarce,"" she told AFP.
At his home in Khan Yunis, near a school run by the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees, Esam said: ""We received guests who were displaced from the Gaza City area, the Al-Rimal neighbourhood and Tal al-Hawa.""
But ""water is a problem"", said the 23-year-old who did not wish to give his full name.
 ""Every day we think of how to get water... If we bathe, we won't drink.""
Those who have sought refuge at the UNRWA schools also desperately seek food and water.
The UN agency's director of communications, Juliette Touma, told AFP more people are likely to become displaced ""as people continue to leave their homes"".
Israel is massing forces and weapons at the border with Gaza ahead of an expected ground offensive.
Despite the Israeli evacuation order, there were air strikes in the south, including in Rafah, where one resident said a doctor's house was targeted.
""All the family was wiped out,"" said Khamis Abu Hilal.Alaa al-Hams pointed to the fresh signs of shelling on a neighbourhood in Rafah.
""I look at the massive destruction. They say there is terrorism here. Where is the humanity they speak of?"" he said.
""All are civilians here, with nothing to do with any organisations, but they died... no one is left alive.""
Samira Kassab stands on the remains of what was once her home in Rafah, asking: ""Where will we go? Where are the Arab countries?
""We have spent our whole lives in displacement. Our home, which housed all my children, was struck... We slept in the street and there is nothing left,"" she said.
""We are isolated. My daughter has cancer and I can't take her to the hospital. I myself suffer from hypertension and diabetes.""But she defiantly raised the victory sign with her hand.
Surrounded by her grandchildren she said: ""I won't leave no matter what, even if I die. We beg for bread from our neighbours, but we will not part with a grain of sand.""",Sunday 15 October 2023 - 21:51pm
Israeli troops battle Hamas militants in southern Gaza,"Israeli forces battled Hamas militants in southern Gaza on Tuesday, prompting a UN warning of an ""even more hellish scenario"" as fighting pushes civilians into a steadily shrinking area of the besieged territory.
After initially focusing its assault on the north of Gaza, the army has now sent ground forces into the south and dropped leaflets telling Palestinian civilians in more districts to evacuate.
Israeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen on Monday near the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, which is packed with displaced civilians, witnesses told AFP.
The Israeli army said it was taking ""aggressive"" action against Hamas and other militants in Khan Yunis, warning that the main road in the north and east of the city ""constitutes a battlefield"".Hamas claimed via Telegram its militants had targeted two personnel carriers and a tank near Khan Yunis.
Its military branch also said it had fired rockets towards Beersheba in southern Israel on Tuesday, while the Israeli military said rocket warning sirens sounded there.
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group's October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and which saw around 240 hostages taken, according to Israeli authorities.
In retaliation for the worst attack in its history, Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas and secure the release of all the hostages held in the Gaza Strip.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says the war has killed nearly 15,900 people in the territory, around 70 percent of them women and children.
- 'Nowhere safe' -
International aid organisations have warned that civilians in the densely populated Strip are running out of places to flee to.""Nowhere is safe in Gaza and there is nowhere left to go,"" said Lynn Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories.
""If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond,"" Hastings said in a statement.
Ambulances, trucks and other vehicles delivered more bloodied, dust-covered casualties to Khan Yunis's Nasser hospital, including children.
After visiting another medical facility in the city, the European Hospital, International Committee of the Red Cross president Mirjana Spoljaric said she saw horrors that were hard to describe.
""What shocked me the most were the children with atrocious injuries and at the same time having lost their parents with no one looking after them,"" she said in a video.""We can't turn away from what is evidently a moral failure in the face of the international community,"" she added.
Their belongings piled onto donkey carts, battered vehicles and even camels, Gazans headed south to try to escape the expanding Israeli offensive.
An estimated 1.8 million people are displaced in Gaza -- roughly three-quarters of the population, according to UN figures.
An Israeli order for people to move from Khan Yunis to the southern city of Rafah ""created panic, fear and anxiety"", according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
People were being pushed into an area that is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip, with roads to the south clogged, he said.
Even in Rafah, resident Abu Jahar al-Hajj said an air strike near his home felt ""like an earthquake"".
""Pieces of concrete started falling on us,"" he said.
Three more Israeli soldiers were killed in fighting in the territory, the army said on Tuesday, raising the number of troop deaths there to 78.The military denied telling the World Health Organization to empty an aid warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours before ground operations in the area render it unusable.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier wrote on social media platform X that his organisation had received a notification from the army ""that we should remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours"".
- Communications blackout -
Key ally the United States has cautioned Israel to do more to avert civilian casualties as operations shift to the south.
Israel on Monday said it was not seeking to force Palestinian civilians to permanently leave their homes, but that it was instead seeking support from aid groups to improve infrastructure in a tiny coastal area of Gaza named Al-Mawasi.
""We have asked civilians to evacuate the battlefield and we have provided a designated humanitarian zone inside the Gaza Strip,"" Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said.
As well as dropping leaflets, the army has been warning civilians in Gaza to leave certain areas ahead of impending strikes via messages to mobile phones.But on Monday, all mobile and telephone services were cut across Gaza ""due to the cut-off of main fibre routes from the Israeli side"", according to Palestinian telecommunications firm Paltel.
Global network monitor Netblocks confirmed Tuesday that Gaza residents were experiencing ""a total loss of communications"".
The fighting follows the collapse on Friday of a Qatar-mediated truce that saw scores of Israeli and other hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
According to the Israeli military, at least 137 hostages are still being held in Gaza, but Hamas has ruled out more releases until a permanent ceasefire is agreed.The war has sparked fears of a wider regional conflict, with frequent exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah across Israel's border with Lebanon.
On Tuesday, the Israeli military said its fighter jets had struck Hezbollah positions in response to launches on Monday from Lebanon into Israel.
The Israel-occupied West Bank has also seen a surge in violence, with more than 250 Palestinians killed there since the war began, according to Palestinian authorities.

West Bank economy in tatters as Gaza war rages,"RAMALLAH - In the occupied West Bank, Hafeth Ghazawneh waits in quiet frustration for customers to visit his falafel stall, which has been deserted since the October 7 Hamas attacks in Israel.
His breakfast and lunch offerings were popular with craftsmen from workshops near Al-Bireh, the twin city of Ramallah, before the Israel-Hamas war broke out.
""Now they're bringing their meals from home because the situation is so difficult,"" Ghazawneh tells AFP, fearing he will have to shut up shop if the war in the Gaza Strip continues.
Ghazawneh says his income has plummeted from around 7,000 shekels ($1,850) per month to just 2,000 ($530).
His worsening situation reflects the current status of the West Bank economy, which is in tatters as the war in Gaza rages.
The conflict erupted after Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on October 7, resulting in the deaths of around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest Israeli figures.
Israel's blistering retaliation has killed at least 24,448 people, around 70 percent of them women, children and adolescents, according to the Hamas government's health ministry in Gaza.The World Bank has estimated the West Bank's GDP could fall by six percent this year, while the International Labour Organization said 32 percent of jobs have already been lost.
The unemployment rate has skyrocketed to 30 percent, up from 14 percent before the war, according to Taher al-Labadi, a researcher at the French Institute for the Near East (Ifpo).
 
- Ballooning losses -
 
Israel has also withdrawn 130,000 work permits from Palestinians in the West Bank, leaving many with no source of income.
The three million Palestinians living in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, cannot travel to Israel without a permit.
Bishara Jubran, manager of a household products and cosmetics factory in Ramallah, considers himself lucky because he has been able to keep all 70 of his employees on the books.But his business has stopped producing soaps made from Dead Sea ingredients which he used to sell to hotels.
As the war rages and visitors stay away, he estimates his losses at $200,000 last year.
He keeps his factory afloat by selling washing powder and other household products on the Palestinian market.
But none of his goods are allowed into Gaza, a key market that used to make up 20 percent of his sales.
In the West Bank, transport costs have increased because of a growing number of checkpoints and the sealing off of certain towns by the Israeli army, Bishara says.
""Many times the truck leaves and it takes them like four or five hours to reach... the north in Nablus to find out that he cannot enter the city. So he just comes back,"" he says.
Now he makes a delivery every two or three days, down from two a day before the war.
Such factors have led to a contraction of the economy, which is now operating at 50 percent of its capacity, according to Abdo Idris, president of the Palestinian Chamber of Commerce.
 
- Economy 'asphyxiated' -
 The Palestinian economy was already ""asphyxiated"" and highly dependent on Israel before the war, researcher Labadi says.
Under the Oslo Accords of the 1990s, it was agreed that a political status quo would be maintained and Palestinians were promised economic development.
But this status quo was undermined by Israel's ""colonisation of the West Bank"", Labadi says, lamenting that Palestinian economic development ""did not take place"".
As a result, in times of crisis, the increasingly fragile Palestinian economy finds itself ""deprived of all its resources and with a very limited capacity for resilience"", he says.
Israel controls the borders of the West Bank and collects taxes on Palestinian products, which it must then pass on to the Palestinian Authority.
But since October 7, those taxes have not been paid.
As of December, Israel had not paid two billion shekels in taxes imposed on Palestinian products, according to the Palestinian finance ministry.
The Palestinian Authority has struggled to pay public servants since the taxes were withheld.Civil servants told AFP their salaries for December have still not been paid.
In October, they received 50 percent of their wages, and 65 percent in November.
""The fear of the unknown is killing us,"" Jubran says. ""We don't know if we'll be able to go to work tomorrow.""

Dire conditions in Gaza hospitals,"GAZA - Intense fighting raged around Gaza's biggest hospital Sunday where doctors said thousands of Palestinians were trapped in dire conditions, as Israel pledged to help evacuate babies from the crippled facility.
READ: Israel-Hamas battles create havoc in Gaza hospitals
Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital is caught in Israel's ground offensive aimed at destroying Hamas, and the compound has been repeatedly hit by strikes, one of which Hamas health officials said destroyed the cardiac ward on Sunday.
The Israeli military has denied deliberately targeting the hospital and has accused the Islamist militant group of using medical facilities or tunnels under them as hideouts -- a charge Hamas denies.Other buildings serving as shelters have also been hit, including a strike on a UN compound in Gaza City that the United Nations Development Programme said late Saturday caused ""a significant number of deaths and injuries."" 
The bloodiest ever Gaza war broke out after Hamas fighters smashed through the militarised border with Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 240 people hostage, according to the most recent Israeli figures.Israel's relentless campaign in response has killed more than 11,000 people, also mostly civilians and including thousands of children, according to the latest figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. 
The ministry has not updated tolls for two days citing the collapse of hospital services.
Witnesses inside the Al-Shifa hospital told AFP by phone on Sunday that ""violent fighting"" had raged around the hospital the whole night.
 
- Dire conditions in Gaza hospitals -
 
Inside Al-Shifa hospital, Doctors Without Borders surgeon Mohammed Obeid said there was no water, power, food or internet access for about 600 post-operative patients, 37-40 babies and 17 people in intensive care. 
The surgeon said in an audio message posted Saturday on social media that two babies died in the Al-Shifa neonatal unit after power to their incubators was cut off and a man also died when his ventilator shut down.The Israeli military pledged Saturday to aid the evacuation of babies from the hospital, noting that ""staff of the Al-Shifa hospital has requested that tomorrow"".
Military spokesman Daniel Hagari said that ""we will help the babies in the paediatric department to get to a safer hospital. We will provide the assistance needed.""
A ""safe passage"" was to be opened from Al-Shifa to allow people to flee toward the south, The Israeli military said Sunday.
Twenty of Gaza's 36 hospitals are ""no longer functioning"", according to the UN's humanitarian agency.
Very little aid has made it into Gaza in the five weeks of war, with the densely populated coastal territory effectively sealed off by a total blockade that Israel has vowed to maintain until the hostages are freed.
The Israeli military confirmed that a Jordanian plane dropped medical equipment and food to the Jordanian Hospital in the Gaza Strip.
The army declined to elaborate further, and Israel's Foreign Ministry also made no comment.As the fighting raged, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday ruled out a role for the current Palestinian Authority government in Gaza once the war is over.
""There will have to be something else there,"" he said, when asked whether the Palestinian Authority (PA), which has partial administrative control in the occupied West Bank, may govern Gaza after the war.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, in a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier this month, said the PA could only assume power in Gaza if a ""comprehensive political solution"" is found for the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict encompassing the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
Netanyahu, in an interview earlier this week, said that Israel would assume ""overall security"" over Gaza ""for an indefinite period"" after the war.
 
- Many thousands flee south -
 
Perched on trucks, crammed in cars, pulled by donkeys on carts, and on foot, many thousands of Palestinians have fled Israeli army strikes on the territory squeezed between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean.
Youssef Mehna, one of many who moved south, said his sick wife is in a wheelchair so he had to rent ""carts pulled by donkeys, trucks, cars"" to transport her.
Sometimes, between rides, they were forced to go on foot. ""So it was me who pushed my wife's chair,"" he told AFP. Almost 1.6 million people have been internally displaced since October 7, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA. This equals about two-thirds of Gaza's population.
However, people arriving in the south were no longer able to find tents or improvised shelter, with some sleeping in the streets, according to AFP journalists.
Strikes were also hitting buildings at the southern end of Gaza in Rafah, the area to which civilians have been urged to evacuate.
A strike in southern Bani Suheila destroyed a dozen houses on Sunday, killing at least four people and wounded at least 30, said an AFP reporter at the scene.
 
- Regional tensions -
 
Around the world, the war has sparked Israeli commemorations for those killed and kidnapped on October 7, and pro-Palestinian rallies decrying the plight of people in Gaza and demanding a ceasefire.
Police estimated 300,000 marched in London on Sunday to support Palestinians. Many carried placards proclaiming ""Stop Bombing Gaza"", ""Ceasefire Now"" or ""Free Palestine"".
The families of Israeli hostages spoke of their agony at a rally in Tel Aviv Saturday.""We don't know their situation and we need them to be released immediately.""
The conflict is stoking regional tensions and fears of the war expanding into neighbouring countries.
Israel fighter jets carried out strikes against ""terror infrastructure"" targets inside Syria in response to cross-border fire directed at the Golan Heights, the military said on Sunday.
Exchanges of cross-border fire have also taken place regularly along the frontier with Lebanon.

"Two dead in West Bank attack after Israel bombards Lebanon, Gaza","Two Israeli women were killed in a shooting in the occupied West Bank on Friday, just hours after Israel bombarded Gaza and Lebanon following rocket fire by Palestinian militants.
The broadening of the conflict since Israeli police clashed with Palestinians inside Jerusalem's flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque drew appeals for restraint from the international community but the Israel army vowed it would not allow Palestinian factions to open a new front in Lebanon.
It was the heaviest rocket fire from Lebanon since Israel fought a 34-day war with Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in 2006 and the first time Israel has confirmed an attack on Lebanese territory since April 2022. 
The Israeli army said it had launched a manhunt for the perpetrators of the West Bank shooting, which also seriously wounded a third woman.
It said the women were fired on in a car as they passed through Hamra junction, in the northern part of the Jordan Valley.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.The attack came after the army carried out air strikes and an artillery bombardment before dawn in response to rocket fire from Gaza and Lebanon.
It said more than 30 rockets had been fired by Palestinian militants from Lebanese territory.
In response it ""struck targets, including terror infrastructures, belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in southern Lebanon"", a statement said. 
Explosions were heard by AFP journalists in Lebanon's Tyre region as well as the Gaza Strip, where Israeli air raids had begun before midnight. 
AFP journalists in the Tyre area said they heard at least three blasts, and a resident of a nearby Palestinian refugee camp said he ""heard explosions"".
""At least two shells fell near the camp"", Abu Ahmad told AFP. 
The latest flare-up comes after Israeli police clashed Wednesday with Palestinians inside the Al-Aqsa mosque in annexed east Jerusalem -- Islam's third-holiest site.
The Lebanese army said it had found and dismantled a multiple rocket launcher in an olive grove in the Marjayoun area near the border, still loaded with six rockets primed to fire at Israel.In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army said it had hit two tunnels and ""two weapon manufacturing sites"" belonging to Hamas ""as a response to the security violations of Hamas during the last few days.""
The army said air defences intercepted 25 rockets, while five hit Israeli territory.
The Israeli army said it ""will not allow the Hamas terrorist organisation to operate from within Lebanon and holds the state of Lebanon responsible for every directed fire emanating from its territory"". 

- 'A heavy price' -

Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht blamed Palestinian militants for the rocket fire from Lebanon.""We know for sure it's Palestinian fire,"" he told reporters. ""It could be Hamas, it could be Islamic Jihad.""
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""Israel's response, tonight and in the future, will exact a heavy price.""
Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, condemned the ""appalling Israeli aggression"" and said it ""holds the Israeli occupation fully responsible for the consequences"".
The Palestinian health ministry said ""partial damage"" was done to the Al-Dorra children's hospital in Gaza City in the overnight strikes, condemning the ""unacceptable"" act. 
Hecht said the Israeli army was aware of the Palestinian allegation and looking into it.
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which patrols the area along the Israeli border, urged restraint. ""Both sides (Lebanon and Israel) have said they do not want a war,"" UNIFIL said in a statement. 
""The actions over the past day are dangerous and risk a serious escalation.""
Israeli emergency services reported one man lightly wounded by shrapnel and a woman injured while running to a shelter.
Inspecting his damaged office in the town of Shlomi, 46-year-old Shlomi Naaman told AFP: ""I heard the siren, I heard the boom, I was in my home, it was very, very scary.""

- Mosque raid -
Israeli riot police had on Wednesday stormed the prayer hall of Al-Aqsa mosque in a pre-dawn raid aiming to dislodge ""law-breaking youths and masked agitators"" they said had barricaded themselves inside.
The violence sparked an exchange of rockets and air strikes with militants in Gaza.
The United States recognised ""Israel's legitimate right to defend itself against all forms of aggression"", State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
UN chief Antonio Guterres called on ""all actors to exercise maximum restraint"".
Britain urged ""all parties"" to ""de-escalate tensions"".
Hamas and Islamic Jihad informed Egypt, a longstanding mediator between Israel and the militant groups, that ""the Palestinian factions will continue their rocket fire if Israel continues its aggressions and air strikes but, if these aggressions stop, they will cease fire,"" Palestinian sources said.
The rocket fire came a day after Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh arrived in Lebanon for a visit.bur-mib-gb/kir

EU pushes Israel on two-state solution after war in Gaza,"EU foreign ministers on Monday pressed Israel for an eventual two-state solution with the Palestinians after the war in Gaza, at meetings with the top diplomats from the two sides and key Arab states in Brussels. 
The surprise Hamas attack on October 7 on Israel and the subsequent devastating military response from Israel has plunged the Middle East into fresh turmoil and sparked fears of a broader conflict.
But while the bloodshed appears to have driven a long-term solution further out of sight, EU officials insist the time is now to talk about finally resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
The 27 EU ministers met first with Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz before they were due to sit down separately with the Palestinian Authority's top diplomat, Riyad al-Maliki.
The foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia were also holding talks with the European ministers.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has drawn condemnation from the United Nations and defied key backer the United States by rejecting calls for a Palestinian state. 
Israel's assault on Gaza has left over 25,000 Palestinians dead, the vast majority women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. 
Netanyahu has vowed ""complete victory"" over Hamas after the attacks by the Islamist movement's fighters on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Hamas militants also seized about 250 hostages and Israel says around 132 remain in besieged Gaza.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told Israel that ""peace and stability cannot be built only by military means"".  
""Which are the other solutions they have in mind? To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill off them?"" Borrell said. 
 
- 'Only solution' -
 
Katz ignored questions from journalists over a future two-state solution and said Israel was focused now on returning the hostages and ensuring its own security.
The EU has struggled for a united stance on the conflict in Gaza as staunch backers of Israel such as Germany have rejected demands for an immediate ceasefire made by the likes of Spain and Ireland.
But there is overall backing in the bloc for a two-state solution. 
""The two-state solution is the only solution, and even those who don't want to know about it have not yet come up with any other alternative,"" said German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock. 
Borrell circulated what he called a ""comprehensive approach"" towards finding peace involving the international community holding a conference that would come up with a plan to be put to both the Israelis and the Palestinians. 
The paper said the international community should then eventually ""set out the consequences they envisage to attach to engagement or non-engagement with the peace plan"" by either side. 
Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said Israel's ""continuation of measures to undermine the two-state solution is dooming the future of the region to more conflicts and more war"".
""The whole world is saying the only way out of this misery is the two-state solution. So the party who's standing against the rights of all peoples of the region, including Israelis, to have peace cannot just be left unaccountable,"" he said. ",Monday 22 January 2024 - 13:00pm
"Arbel and Judith, women hostages in Gaza limbo","With nearly 130 hostages still held by Hamas 10 weeks after its unprecedented attack on Israel, AFP has taken a focused look at the lives of two women among the captives.
Both were kidnapped from the Nir Oz kibbutz, close to the Gaza border. 
Hundreds of families were ripped apart when Hamas fighters streamed over the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,140 people and taking some 250 hostages back to the Gaza Strip.
Israeli officials say 129 hostages remain in the besieged Palestinian territory, where the Israeli army's retaliatory assault has killed at least 18,800 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll from the Hamas government in Gaza.
During a week-long truce last month, Hamas released dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, but several captives have also been found dead.
And on Friday the Israeli army said that three hostages were killed mistakenly by its troops.
Their relatives have had no news of them since, and hold out hope they are still alive.
 
- Arbel Yehud, 28 -Family members described Arbel Yehud to AFP as gentle young woman with a magnetic smile.
Before she was taken hostage, she was brimming with plans for the future, they said.
She was captured at the same time as her brother Dolev, 35, and her partner Ariel Cunio, 26. All three lived on the Nir Oz kibbutz and their fate remains unknown.
Her father Yechi Yehud, 64, told AFP about his daughter from the living room of his modest home in Rishon LeZion, south of Tel Aviv.
He described how Arbel worked in the kibbutz's education system before becoming a guide at the nearby GrooveTech centre dedicated to technology and space.
She would tell visitors about ""the stars, and the universe... and the satellites,"" a topic that fascinated her, Yechi said.
Arbel and Ariel had been a couple for five years at the time they were captured.
""They just came back from a big tour in South America... they were very happy with a lot of plans for the future,"" Yechi said.
Yechi left the kibbutz in 2016 to stay with his wife Yael in Rishon LeZion in the house where he was born. 
""Our children refused to leave the kibbutz. I tried sometimes to ask them to leave,"" he said. 
Even before the October 7 attack, sirens warning of possible Hamas rocket fire were a frequent reminder of the threat from across the nearby border. 
During last month's truce, Yechi expected his daughter to be among the dozens of women and children released.
""The emotional turmoil grew from the moment it didn't happen,"" he said.
""We are a strong and united family, we do our best to hold each other up, to stay calm, not collapse, not overreact, but this was a very hard breaking point. Very hard.""
He put on a brave face but said he was worried about his daughter's treatment.
In Israel, there has been growing anger over accounts of rape and sexual violence carried out by Hamas fighters on October 7 and against hostages in Gaza -- accusations the militant group denies.
""I don't know what is going on with her, if she has been tortured, if she's been raped,"" Yechi said. ""I fear the abuses she might face.
""She is such a delicate soul and maybe they are raping her. Those are my fears.
""As a father... I am crushed inside. From outside, maybe I'm speaking logically and appearing strong. But inside, I'm crushed.""
 
- Judith Weinstein Haggai, 70 -
 Relentless air strikes, fierce fighting on the ground and the conditions of their captivity pose a serious threat to the hostages in Gaza.
For many of their loved ones waiting at home without news, every passing day diminishes any hope of seeing them again. 
""I want to believe she's alive but... I'm not sure,"" said Ahl Haggai, the son of Judith Weinstein Haggai.
His mother is thought to be the oldest woman remaining among the hostages. She went missing along with her husband Gad Haggai, 72, on October 7. 
In a final phone call Judith told a paramedic the couple had been wounded, Ahl said. Her glasses were later found in the kibbutz.
""The only evidence we have... is a video of my dad on the back of a truck, laying down injured,"" Ahl said.
""We can't say if (today) he's dead or alive and we believe she was inside the truck, but we have no evidence for it."" 
Ahl is torn between hope and despair. He believes that if his mother was killed and left in Israel, her body would already have been recognised. ""She's nowhere to be found,"" he said. 
When describing his mother, he had to remind himself not to speak of her as if she was already dead.
""My mum was... is, my mum is, the most gentle human being I know, she's so sweet and kind and honest and loving,"" said Haggai, 35.
Judith was born in United States and grew up in Canada, he said. She visited Israel as a young woman and stayed after falling in love with Gai. 
The couple led a ""healthy life, they meditated, they took walks together, they rode their bicycles in the fields all the time,"" Ahl said.
""She didn't like the rocket alerts, the bombs, she didn't like the fact that two kilometres (little more than a mile) from her there are two million people that she can't be in contact with.""
Judith worked as an English teacher for 30 years and used to help children with special educational needs. 
""All the kids loved her,"" Ahl said. ""She always managed to get to the hearts of the toughest kids,"" he added, speaking in the garden of his home in Amikam, northern Israel.
He described how his mother loved to make puppets to help the children study and express themselves. 
""In the last two years she had been working in mindfulness with the kids, helping them go through the anxiety from the situation next to Gaza,"" he said. 
""She's always curious, she's always learning something, she's always in the university studying,"" he said, adding that she was interested in everything from drawing to poetry.
When the first hostages were handed over during the truce, Ahl hoped his mother would be among them.
""I didn't bring my hopes too high... but still every day I had a tiny hope that I'll get the list and she will be in the list,"" he said.
""I wish I knew what has happened to her in their hands. But I imagine that if she did survive, then she can still keep the positive energy, positive thinking, positive hopes.""",Saturday 16 December 2023 - 16:59pm
Climate and Gaza crises share spotlight as world leaders attend COP28,"DUBAI - World leaders take centre stage at UN climate talks in Dubai on Friday, under pressure to step up efforts to limit global warming as the Israel-Hamas conflict casts a shadow over the summit.
The COP28 conference kicked off on Thursday with an early victory as nations agreed to launch a ""loss and damage"" fund for vulnerable countries devastated by natural disasters.
But delegates face two weeks of tough negotiations on an array of issues that have long bedevilled climate talks, starting with the future of fossil fuels.
The sense of urgency was heightened by a UN warning that 2023 is on track to become the hottest year on record, raising fears the world will not meet the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
""Now the real work only begins,"" the oil-rich UAE's COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber said on Thursday.
""I will be rolling up my sleeves myself, engaging and helping address this challenge and delivering real, actionable results,"" Jaber said, though he claimed there was ""positivity"" and an ""optimistic"" vibe following the loss and damage announcement.
Jaber, who heads the UAE's national oil firm ADNOC, said the ""role of fossil fuels"" must be included at the UN's climate talks.
Activists, countries hardest hit by climate impacts and UN chief Antonio Guterres have called for a phase out of fossil fuels, which are responsible for three quarters of greenhouse gas emissions.
 
- Gaza war -
 
The spotlight now turns to more than 140 kings, presidents and prime ministers who will address delegates at the sprawling Expo City Dubai complex on Friday and Saturday.
Britain's King Charles III will kick off those addresses, followed by leaders from nations including the likes of Brazil, Kenya, Tonga and Ukraine.
But the climate crisis will share the agenda with the conflict in Gaza.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog met UAE counterpart Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Thursday and will be among the leaders addressing the COP28 conference on Friday.
Palestinian counterpart Mahmud Abbas had also been scheduled to speak but his office told AFP that he was no longer going and his foreign minister would go to Dubai instead.
The conference began on Thursday with a moment of silence -- at the request of the Egyptian head of last year's COP -- for the civilians who have died in the conflict.
The war began on October 7 when Hamas and other militants from Gaza poured over the border into Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping about 240, according to Israeli authorities.
Aiming to destroy Hamas, Israel retaliated with an air and ground offensive that the Hamas government in Gaza says has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, and reduced large parts of the north of the territory to rubble.
Herzog is using his COP28 visit for a diplomatic push to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas.
He ""appealed"" to his Emirati counterpart ""to employ his full political weight to promote and speed up the return home of the hostages,"" the Israeli president's office said in a statement.
US Vice President Kamala Harris, who will represent the United States at COP28, will meet with regional officials on the Israel-Hamas conflict, according to the White House.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday said that a temporary truce in the conflict was ""producing results"" and should continue.
As part of the week-long pause in fighting, Hamas has freed dozens of hostages taken during last month's attack on Israel in exchange for the release of more than 200 Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.

Blinken hopes for progress on Gaza at UN Security Council,"NEW YORK - Secretary of State Antony Blinken voiced guarded hope Wednesday that the United States would be able to support a new UN Security Council resolution on Gaza, with a sticking point on access for aid.
The United States, Israel's critical ally, has vetoed two resolutions at the Security Council as it rejected calls on Israel to end its military campaign launched in response to the October 7 attack by Hamas.
Blinken, addressing reporters in Washington, said that the United States was engaging ""in very good faith"" with other countries, after fury in the Arab world over the vetoes.
""We've been working this intensely. I've been on the phones about this for the last couple of days,"" Blinken said.
""I hope we can get to a good place,"" he said.
The latest version of the draft resolution, led by the United Arab Emirates, stops short of using the word ceasefire and focuses instead on humanitarian access into the beleaguered Gaza Strip, where 85 percent of the population has been displaced.
Blinken indicated that the humanitarian issue was the sticking point, with Israel insisting on full control of supplies that enter the blockaded Palestinian territory.
""The purpose of the resolution as stated by the countries that put it forward is to facilitate and help expand humanitarian assistance that's getting into Gaza. And we fully support that,"" Blinken said.
""We want to make sure that the resolution in what it calls for and requires actually advances that effort and doesn't do anything that could actually hurt the delivery of humanitarian assistance, make it more complicated,"" he said.
Blinken argued that the United States has through its diplomacy made progress in recent days, including through the arrival of commercial trucks and the opening of a second crossing into Gaza.
- 'Gut-wrenching' -
 
Hamas infiltrated into Israel on October 7 and killed around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. 
Israel responded with a relentless air and ground campaign. The Hamas government's media office in the Gaza Strip said Wednesday at least 20,000 people have been killed, among them 8,000 children and 6,200 women. 
Blinken, responding to criticism that the United States is isolated in its support for Israel, renewed calls on Israel to ""minimize the harm"" to civilians but said there also needed to be pressure on Hamas.
""The last couple of months have been gut-wrenching. You see the suffering of men, women and especially children in Gaza,"" Blinken said.
""That affects each of us. It affects me very, very deeply.""
But Blinken deplored what he called ""silence on what Hamas could do, should do, must do if we want to end the suffering of innocent men, women and children.""
""It would be good if the world could unite around that proposition as well.""
Blinken also voiced hope for a new pause in fighting to free hostages, as Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh arrived in Cairo on Wednesday for talks.
""We remain very actively engaged in seeing if we can get a pause back on and hostages moving out again,"" Blinken said.
During a week-long truce late last month brokered by Qatar with the help of the United States and Egypt, 80 Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.

"Gaza truce largely holds as Palestinians, Israelis count deadly cost","GAZA CITY - Calm returned to Gaza Sunday as a fragile ceasefire largely held, leaving Palestinians and Israelis to count the cost of five days of cross-border fire that killed dozens.
Fishermen took to their boats in the coastal Palestinian enclave, as Gazans emerged from sheltering in their homes during the fierce exchange of fire.
The fighting broke out Tuesday with Israeli strikes on the Islamic Jihad militant group. It ceased late Saturday following days of truce talks led by Egypt.
But on Sunday evening, the Israeli army said one rocket launched from the Gaza Strip ""fell in an open area"" in Israel's south, prompting retaliatory artillery fire at two military positions in the northern strip.
Islamic Jihad said in a statement the rocket fire was the result of a ""technical error"", stressing the militant group ""respects the ceasefire"".
As the skies fell silent, residents were left to mourn the 33 people killed in Gaza, as well as the two in Israel -- a Palestinian labourer from the blockaded territory and an elderly Israeli.
More than 50 homes were destroyed and around 950 people displaced in Gaza, said the United Nations, citing local officials.""We're on the street. There's no home for my children or their children,"" said Mohammed al-Louh, whose house was destroyed by Israeli strikes.
Medics said 190 people were wounded in Gaza and, in Israel, seven received injuries directly resulting from Palestinian rocket fire.

- 'It will begin again' -

Authorities on Sunday lifted movement restrictions imposed on Israelis living near the Gaza border.
Sunday also saw Israel re-open its two crossings with Gaza for Palestinians with work permits or permission to access essential medical treatment. This has paved the way for supplies of medicine, food and fuel to reach the territory.
In the coastal Israeli city of Ashkelon, resident Michelle Weiss warned the fighting is ""not finished"".
""Now I'm free, now I can go out... but I know it will begin again,"" she told AFP by the beach.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday welcomed the ceasefire agreement and offered his ""deepest condolences"" to victims' families, according to a statement from his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.
The secretary-general also commended Egypt for its ""key role in bringing the hostilities to an end,"" and the efforts of Qatar, Lebanon and the United States, Dujarric said.
Guterres ""calls on all sides to observe the ceasefire,"" the statement added.
Gaza, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, has been plagued by poverty and unemployment since Israel imposed a crippling blockade in 2007 when the Islamist movement Hamas took control.
The territory has seen numerous wars between militant groups and Israel since then, and this week's fighting was the worst in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since an August flare-up that killed nearly 50 Gazans.
While Israel and Islamic Jihad committed to the ceasefire, both warned they would not hesitate to resume fire if the other side violated the agreement.
""Quiet will be met with quiet,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
""Today Israel's enemies in Gaza and far beyond know that even if they try to hide, we can -- and will -- get to them,"" Netanyahu said at the start of Sunday's cabinet meeting, calling the military operation ""perfect"".
The Israeli strikes on Gaza killed at least six top figures from Islamic Jihad, which is considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union.
At least six children and multiple civilians were also among the dead in Gaza.Tariq Salmi, an Islamic Jihad spokesman, said if Israel ""commits any foolish act or any assassination... the resistance will resume where it left off"".
Islamic Jihad had responded to the Israeli strikes with volleys of rocket fire, prompting sirens to blare.
An army official said Sunday that militants fired 1,468 projectiles at Israel, of which 1,139 crossed into Israel's air space, with the army intercepting more than 430 rockets.

- 'Key facilitator' -

There were multiple failed rounds of truce talks that had sparked fears the conflict could escalate before a deal was reached, a diplomatic source close to the negotiations told AFP.
Lebanese politician Bassel al-Hassan was a ""key facilitator"" in contacting the Islamic Jihad leadership and getting the talks back on track, said the source, who was not authorised to speak publicly to the media.""We managed to make certain arrangements so that there was a communication channel with the UN and the Egyptians,"" said a committee official, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivities of the negotiations.
As calm in Gaza was mostly restored, violence persisted in the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War.
Israeli forces raided central Nablus early Sunday, sparking clashes with Palestinian residents, according to an AFP photographer.
An army statement said troops had arrested two people suspected of shooting at soldiers in the occupied territory.

Israeli PM says civilians can leave crowded Rafah before invasion,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Sunday that civilians crammed into the southern Gaza Strip would be able to leave before troops enter in pursuit of Hamas militants.
His comments, alongside visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, follow international fears over the fate of the roughly 1.5 million people who have sought refuge in Rafah, most of them displaced from Gaza's war.
The office of the right-wing premier, whose security and war cabinets were to discuss the latest international efforts towards a truce deal, had on Friday said he approved the military's plan for an operation in Rafah as well as ""the evacuation of the population"".As others have done, Scholz raised the question: 
""How should more than 1.5 million people be protected? Where should they go?""
The United States -- which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military assistance -- has said it wants a ""clear and implementable plan"" to ensure civilians are ""out of harm's way"".
- 'In the name of humanity' -
Before meeting Scholz, Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting that ""no amount of international pressure will stop us from realising all the goals of the war"", and that to do this, ""we will also operate in Rafah"".Israel has repeatedly threatened a ground offensive against Hamas in Rafah, where people shelter in tents crammed up against the Egyptian border.
UN World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged against a military operation there, ""in the name of humanity"".
Tedros said ""this humanitarian catastrophe must not be allowed to worsen"".
Netanyahu leads a coalition of religious and ultra-nationalist parties. His failure to bring home the hostages taken by Hamas militants during their attack which started the war has led to mounting protests within his country as well as domestic calls for early elections.
Hamas's unprecedented attack from Gaza on October 7 resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has carried out a relentless bombardment and ground offensive which has killed at least 31,645 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.
International envoys were planning to meet in Qatar soon to revive stalled talks for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. 
Palestinian militants seized about 250 Israeli and foreign hostages during the October 7 attack. Dozens were released during a week-long truce in November, and Israel believes about 130 remain in Gaza including 32 presumed dead.
A Hamas proposal calls for an Israeli withdrawal from ""all cities and populated areas"" in Gaza during a six-week truce and for more humanitarian aid, according to an official from the Palestinian group.
- 'Security responsibility' -
Israel plans to attend the talks, with cabinet members due to ""decide on the mandate"" of their delegation before its departure, Netanyahu's office said, without giving a date for when they would leave.
In Jerusalem, Scholz called for ""a hostage deal with a longer-lasting ceasefire"", and appealed for a ""negotiated two-state solution"" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""Terror cannot be defeated with military means alone,"" Scholz said.
Netanyahu has drawn condemnation from the United Nations and defied the United States by rejecting calls for a Palestinian state. 
The Israeli prime minister said on Sunday that he would not accept a peace deal that weakens Israel and leaves it unable to defend itself against hostile neighbours.
Netanyahu also reiterated his position that ""Israel has to have the necessary security responsibility"" in Gaza.
There was no letup in the fighting, and at least 92 people were killed over the previous 24 hours, the health ministry said on Sunday.
The dead included 12 members of the same family whose house was hit in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza.
- 'She's dead' -
Palestinian girl Leen Thabit, retrieving a white dress from under the rubble of their flattened house, cried as she told AFP her cousin was killed in the strike.
""She's dead. Only her dress is left,"" Thabit said. ""What do they want from us?""
Shelling and clashes were reported in south Gaza's main city of Khan Yunis as well as elsewhere, and the Israeli army said its forces had killed ""approximately 18 terrorists"" in central Gaza since Saturday.
More than five months of war and an Israeli siege have led to dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, where the United Nations has repeatedly warned of looming famine for the coastal territory's 2.4 million people.
Humanitarians have cited Israeli restrictions as among the obstacles they face in reaching the needy. Israel has blamed shortages on the Palestinian side, specifically a lack of capacity to distribute aid once it gets in.
Facing difficulty on the ground, donors have turned to the air and sea.A second ship was due to depart from Cyprus along a new maritime corridor to bring food and relief goods, officials of the Mediterranean nation said.
Jordan on Sunday announced the latest aid airdrop over northern Gaza together with aircraft from the United States, Egypt and Germany -- which announced Saturday it had parachuted aid into Gaza for the first time.
In Rafah, the situation has only grown worse, said medical staff at a clinic run by Palestinian volunteers.
Samar Gregea, a physician herself uprooted from Gaza City in the north, said medicine is in short supply, and ""all children"" are suffering from malnutrition, with a spike in hepatitis A cases.
""Children require foods high in sugars, like dates, which are currently unavailable,"" Gregea said.

Israeli ground forces move into south of Gaza,"Israel has moved ground forces into the south of Gaza in its war on Hamas, witnesses said Monday, despite global concern over mounting civilian deaths and fears the conflict will spread elsewhere in the Middle East.
Dozens of Israeli tanks as well as armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers entered the south of the territory near the city of Khan Yunis, which is crowded with internally displaced Palestinians, witnesses told AFP.
Amin Abu Hawli, 59, said the Israeli vehicles were ""two kilometres inside"" Gaza in the village of al-Qarara, while Moaz Mohammed, 34, said Israeli tanks were rolling down the strip's main north-south highway, the Salah al-Din road.
Weeks after Israel sent ground forces and tanks into northern Gaza, the army has been air-dropping leaflets in the besieged territory's south, especially around Khan Yunis, telling Palestinians there to flee to other areas.The army ""continues to expand its ground operation against main Hamas fronts in the Gaza Strip,"" Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said Sunday. ""Wherever there is a Hamas stronghold, the IDF operates.""
Full-scale fighting resumed Friday after the collapse of a week-long truce brokered by Qatar, the United States and Egypt, during which Israel and Hamas had exchanged scores of hostages and prisoners.
Air strikes have since intensified in Gaza's south, said James Elder, a spokesman for the United Nations children's agency UNICEF.
""Despite what has been assured, attacks in the south of Gaza are every bit as vicious as what the north endured,"" he posted Monday on X, formerly Twitter.
""Somehow, it's getting worse for children and mothers.""Israel has vowed to crush Hamas in retaliation for the Islamist militant group's October 7 attacks that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 240 hostages taken, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel's military said Sunday it had carried out around 10,000 air strikes in total, while Gaza militants had resumed rocket salvos into Israel, most of which had been intercepted.
The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 15,500 people have been killed in Gaza, about 70 percent of them women and children -- a death toll that has sparked global alarm and mass demonstrations.
- 'No safe place' -""There is no safe place in Gaza,"" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said as a UN agency estimated around 1.8 million people in Gaza, roughly 75 percent of the population, had been displaced.
The Israeli army said Monday three more soldiers had been killed in fighting in the northern Gaza Strip, raising the number of troop deaths there to 75.
The fatalities brought the number of Israeli defence personnel killed since October 7 -- among them those killed in the Hamas attacks themselves and including soldiers, reservists, kibbutz guards and others -- to 401.
Under the temporary truce that expired Friday, 80 Israeli hostages were freed, in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. More than two dozen Thai and other captives were also released from Gaza.More air strikes have rained down on northern Gaza where the Hamas-run government and the official Palestinian news agency Wafa said the entrance of the Kamal Adwan hospital was hit late Sunday.
Several people were killed in the strike, Wafa said, while Hamas accused Israel on Telegram of a ""grave violation"" of humanitarian law. Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military did not immediately comment.Israel says Hamas uses hospitals and other civilian infrastructure for military purposes, an accusation the militant group denies.
Nine-year-old Huda, who was wounded in the head, arrived at the Deir al-Balah hospital with a Red Cross convoy bringing casualties from northern Gaza.
""She doesn't answer me any more,"" said her bereaved father Abdelkarim Abu Warda.
- 'Too many innocents killed' -Israel's ally the United States has intensified calls for the protection of Gaza's civilians, with Vice President Kamala Harris saying that ""too many innocent Palestinians have been killed"".
A White House official said Sunday the United States believes Israel is ""making an effort"" to minimise civilian casualties in Gaza.
Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy said those killed ""would still be alive"" had Hamas not carried out the October 7 attacks.
Israel said Monday it was not seeking to force Palestinian civilians to permanently leave their homes, even as it acknowledged conditions in Gaza were ""tough"".
Any suggestion of Palestinian dispersal is highly contentious in the Arab world as the war that led to Israel's creation 75 years ago gave rise to the exodus or forced displacement of 760,000 Palestinians.
Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said Monday: ""We are not trying to displace anyone, we are not trying to move anybody from anywhere permanently.""We have asked civilians to evacuate the battlefield and we have provided a designated humanitarian zone inside the Gaza Strip,"" he said, referring to a tiny coastal area of the territory named Al-Mawasi.
With fears of a wider regional conflagration rising, a US destroyer shot down multiple drones over the Red Sea while assisting commercial ships on Sunday, according to the US Central Command.
Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels -- who said they targeted two of the ships -- launched a series of drones and missiles towards Israel in recent weeks and seized a cargo vessel last month.
In Iraq, an air attack killed at least five pro-Iranian militants on Sunday, according to Iraqi security sources, a day after Baghdad warned Washington against ""attacks"" on its territory.
Fighting also flared on Israel's northern border with Lebanon.The Israeli army said it had launched artillery strikes in response to cross-border fire, and its fighter jets hit targets linked to Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
The Israel-occupied West Bank has also seen a surge in violence since October.
The Palestinian Authority's health ministry said two Palestinians had been shot dead in an Israeli raid on the northern West Bank town of Qalqilya, adding that Israeli forces kept the two bodies.

UN flags at half-mast for staff killed in Gaza,"NEW YORK - Flags flew at half-mast at UN compounds across the globe Monday, as staff observed a minute's silence for the more than 100 colleagues killed in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war.
The blue and white United Nations flag was first lowered at 9:30 am local time at offices in Bangkok, Tokyo and Beijing, and later, other UN offices followed suit.
The UN agency for supporting Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) announced on Friday that 101 of its employees had died in the Gaza Strip since the war erupted just over a month ago.
And on Sunday, the UN reported ""a significant number of deaths and injuries"" in strikes on one of its facilities in Gaza.
""UNRWA staff in Gaza appreciate the UN lowering the flag around the world,"" the agency director in the Gaza Strip Tom White, said in a statement.
""In Gaza however, we have to keep the UN flag flying high as a sign that we are still standing and serving the people of Gaza.""  
Israel has been relentlessly bombarding the Gaza Strip since Hamas fighters carried out an October 7 attack on southern Israeli communities, the deadliest in the country's history.
About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks and around 240 people taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.
More than 11,000 people, most of them civilians and many of them children, have been killed in Gaza in retaliatory strikes by Israel, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the territory.
In Geneva, the second-largest UN headquarters after New York, the UN flag on Monday flew at half-mast and none of the other flags of the 193 member countries were hoisted along the main alley of the compound. 
Staff were also invited to hold a ""private"" minute of silence, spokesman Rolando Gomez said.
""Over the last month, 101 of our colleagues have lost their lives in Gaza,"" Tatiana Valovaya, Director-General of the UN Office at Geneva, told the dozens of staff members gathered for the ceremony.
""This is the highest number of aid workers killed in the history of our organisation in such a short time."" 
Events were also held in Kathmandu and Kabul, where the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan Roza Otunbayeva led about 250 people in observing the minute's silence.",Monday 13 November 2023 - 15:19pm
Israel PM orders troops to ready for push into crowded Rafah,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered troops to prepare to enter Gaza's crowded southern city of Rafah, even as new talks aimed at securing a truce with Hamas were set to open Thursday in Cairo.
Netanyahu announced the order after rejecting Hamas's response to a ceasefire proposal at the centre of recent intensive diplomatic efforts, dismissing what he called the militant group's ""bizarre demands"".
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken -- in Israel as part of his fifth Middle East crisis tour since the October 7 attack -- insisted he still saw ""space for agreement to be reached"" to halt the fighting and bring home hostages.
Heavy fighting raged on unabated, with more air strikes hitting Hamas-ruled Gaza, now in its fifth month of war, where the health ministry said another 109 people were killed overnight.
Alarm has mounted especially for the more than one million Palestinians crowded into Gaza's far south as the battlefront has crept ever closer to the city of Rafah on the Egyptian border.UN chief Antonio Guterres warned on Wednesday that an Israeli military push into the city ""would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare"".
The Israeli army said Thursday it was operating in both the north and the south of the Gaza Strip, and that it had killed 30 ""terrorists"" across the territory.
""Two terrorists that participated in the October 7 massacre"" were arrested as well as a member of Hamas's commando unit, it added.
Netanyahu, in televised remarks Wednesday, said he had ordered troops to ""prepare to operate"" in Rafah and predicted that coming months would bring ""total victory"".
Regarding the ceasefire proposal, he added: ""Giving in to the bizarre demands of Hamas that we have just heard will... only invite another massacre.""
Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv that Hamas's counter-proposal had at least offered an opportunity ""to pursue negotiations"".""While there are some clear non-starters in Hamas's response, we do think it creates space for agreement to be reached, and we will work at that relentlessly until we get there,"" Blinken said, hours after meeting Netanyahu.
He later met with moderates in Netanyahu's war cabinet, including Benny Gantz and Gabi Eisenkot, for talks on ""the hostages and the strong desire that we both have to see them returned to their families"", and also held talks with Israel's main opposition leader Yair Lapid.
 
- Cairo talks -
 Egypt was urging ""both parties to show the necessary flexibility"" to make a deal, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Hamas said a delegation led by Khalil al-Hayya, a leading member of the group's political bureau, was travelling to Cairo on Thursday.The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas and launched air strikes and a ground offensive that have killed at least 27,840 people, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
Militants also seized around 250 hostages on October 7. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza, of whom 29 are believed to have died.The fate of the hostages has gripped Israeli society, and while Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted military pressure is the only way to bring them home, he has faced mounting calls to strike a deal.
Addressing the prime minister, one of the hostages released as part of a temporary truce in November, Adina Moshe, told a press conference in Tel Aviv: ""Everything is in your hands.""
""And I'm very afraid and very concerned that if you continue with this line of destroying Hamas, there won't be any hostages left to release.""
 
- 'Abysmal conditions' - 
 As Israel prepared to press further south, fears have grown for the displaced Palestinian civilians thronging Rafah, pressed against Gaza's southern border with Egypt.
More than half of Gaza's 2.4 million people are estimated to have sought safety in the city, according to the United Nations.
""Their living conditions are abysmal,"" UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said. ""They lack the basic necessities to survive, stalked by hunger, disease and death.
""As the war encroaches further into Rafah, I am extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of families which have endured the unthinkable in search of safety.""Blinken stopped short of calling on Israel not to move on the city, but did voice concern. Any ""military operation that Israel undertakes needs to put civilians first and foremost,"" he said.
The Gaza war has sparked a surge in violence across the region by Iran-backed groups operating in solidarity with Hamas, drawing retaliatory attacks from Israel and the United States and its allies.
A US air strike in Iraq on Wednesday killed a senior commander from a pro-Iran armed group who the US Central Command said was ""responsible for directly planning and participating in attacks on US forces"".
The strike came after Washington last week launched a wave of attacks on Iran-linked targets in Iraq and Syria following the killing of three American troops in neighbouring Jordan.

"Hundreds of wounded, foreigners hope to flee war-torn Gaza","GAZA CITY - Hundreds more wounded and foreign passports holders hoped to escape war-torn Gaza on Thursday as Israeli forces bombed and fought intense ground battles with Hamas militants in the besieged Palestinian territory.
Ambulances were set to rush several dozen patients to Egyptian hospitals, and about 400 foreigners or dual nationals were expected to escape as the southern Rafah crossing was to open for a second day, said border officials on both sides.
Egypt said that eventually it hoped to help evacuate 7,000 foreigners from more than 60 countries from the densely crowded territory of 2.4 million people that has endured weeks of sustained bombardment.
ntense ground battles flared again overnight in northern Gaza as Israel has sought to destroy Hamas over the bloody October 7 attacks, the worst in the country's 75-year-history, which it says claimed 1,400 lives.
The Israeli army, which is also seeking to free around 240 hostages, said it had killed ""dozens"" of enemy forces as ""terrorist cells in the northern Gaza Strip fired anti-tank missiles, detonated explosive devices and hurled grenades"".
""The soldiers engaged with the terrorists, with the assistance of artillery fire and tanks, while directing an aerial strike from a helicopter and a missile strike from a naval boat.""The UN's top human rights body Wednesday decried ""the high number of civilian casualties"" and the massive scale of destruction and voiced ""serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes"".
A total of 227 aid trucks have entered under a US-brokered deal, according to the United Nation's humanitarian agency OCHA, an amount aid groups say falls far short of the desperate need.
Special concern has focused on repeated heavy strikes on Gaza's largest refugee camp -- densely populated Jabalia north of Gaza City -- where explosions brought down residential buildings and left giant craters on Tuesday and Wednesday. ",Thursday 02 November 2023 - 11:30am
Gaza world's 'most dangerous place' for children: UNICEF,"UNITED NATIONS - The head of the United Nations children's agency on Wednesday called the besieged Gaza Strip ""the most dangerous place in the world to be a child,"" and said that the hard-won truce deal between Israel and Hamas was not enough to save their lives.
UNICEF's executive director Catherine Russell told the UN Security Council that over 5,300 children have reportedly been killed in Gaza since Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, accounting for 40 percent of the deaths.
""This is unprecedented,"" said Russell, who had just returned from a trip to southern Gaza. ""I am haunted by what I saw and heard.""
Russell welcomed a deal reached Wednesday by Israel and Hamas to free hostages and pause ferocious fighting and bombardment in Gaza.
Some 240 people -- ranging from infants to the elderly -- were taken captive during the October 7 attack by Hamas militants that killed about 1,200 in Israel, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
But Russell said that a pause is not enough and called for ""an urgent humanitarian ceasefire to immediately put a stop to this carnage.""
""For children to survive..., for humanitarian workers to stay and effectively deliver..., humanitarian pauses are simply not enough,"" she said.
Russell said that an additional 1,200 children are believed to remain under the rubble of bombed-out buildings or are otherwise unaccounted for.
""In addition to bombs, rockets, and gunfire, Gaza's children are at extreme risk from catastrophic living conditions,"" Russell added.
""One million children -- or all children inside the territory -- are now food insecure, facing what could soon become a catastrophic nutrition crisis.""
UNICEF estimates that acute malnutrition in children could increase by nearly 30 per cent in Gaza over the next months.
Also addressing the Security Council, the head of the United Nations Population Fund, Natalia Kanem, drew attention to the plight of Gaza's pregnant women, with some 5,500 expected to deliver babies under appalling conditions in the coming month.
""At a moment when new life is beginning, what should be a moment of joy is overshadowed by death and destruction, horror and fear,"" said Kanem.
Sima Bahous, who leads another agency, UN Women, said that girls and women were facing unheard-of dangers.
According to Bahous, 67 percent of those killed in Gaza so far have been women and children. ""That is two mothers killed every hour and seven women every two hours,"" she said.
""We have witnessed six rounds of violence in Gaza in the past 15 years, yet the ferocity and destruction that the Gazan people are being forced to endure under our watch has reached an intensity we have never seen before,"" she said.

Rights advocates denounce 'systemic abuse' in Israeli prisons,"In the shadow of the war raging in Gaza, record numbers of Palestinian detainees are filling Israeli prisons, where they face ""systemic abuse"" and torture, rights advocates warn, calling for international action.
Members of several Israeli NGOs travelled to Geneva this week to raise concerns before the United Nations about a major ""crisis"" inside the country's prisons. 
""We are extremely, extremely concerned,"" said Tal Steiner, the executive director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI).
""What we're looking at is a crisis,"" she told AFP.
She said nine people had allegedly died behind bars since October 7, according to Israeli sources. 
And ""there are almost 10,000 Palestinians in Israeli custody right now... a 200-percent increase from any normal year"".
While the UN and others have long raised concerns about conditions for Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons, Steiner said the situation had worsened dramatically since war erupted in Gaza.
The conflict began on October 7 after an unprecedented attack by Hamas resulting in about 1,160 deaths inside Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP count based on official figures.
The militants also seized about 250 Israeli and foreign hostages. Israel believes about 130 of them remain in Gaza, including 32 believed to have died.
Israel's offensive inside Gaza has since killed more than 31,500 people, mainly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
 
- 'Widespread and systemic' -
""During the military onslaught on Gaza, there's been a crisis within Israeli detention facilities and prisons that has been really left ignored,"" said Miriam Azem of the Adalah legal centre. The centre is dedicated to protecting the rights of Israel's Palestinian citizens.
Her organisation had managed to document ""19 clear cases"" of torture within the Israeli prison system just since October 7, including sexual violence, she told AFP.
""We're seeing really widespread and systemic use of many, many tools in order to inflict torture and ill-treatment on Palestinians.""
This crisis, she said, ""requires the immediate intervention of the international community"".
Steiner agreed, warning that this was ""an ongoing crisis.
""People are (suffering) in detention right now... An urgent intervention is very much needed.""
The Israeli Prison Service told AFP: ""All prisoners are detained according to the law.""
The service was ""not aware of the claims"", against it, a spokesperson said, but stressed that any complaints filed by detainees ""will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities"".
The NGOs also voiced alarm at reported conditions inside the military camps holding those detained inside Gaza.
At least 27 Palestinians have reportedly died in such camps since October, Steiner said, adding that this was ""unprecedented and extremely severe"".
There was no access to the camps, nor had her organisation, or foreign journalists, been permitted to enter Gaza to speak with those released, she said.
But reports relying on testimony from former camp inmates suggest that detainees are often held ""in open-air cages"", where ""they are handcuffed and blindfolded 24 hours a day"".
Prisoners reportedly had to sleep on the floor of the cages in the cold, were beaten, and deprived of medical care, she added.
 
- Unlawful combatants -
The Israeli army said detainees are questioned in the facilities operating since the October 7 attack and those ""found to be unrelated to terrorist activity are released back to the Gaza Strip"".
Some of the detainees who died had injuries or complex medical conditions, it added, saying each death was investigated by the Military Advocate General's Corps. 
""At the end of the investigations, their findings will be forwarded to the Military Prosecution's Office,"" the army said.
While there are no official numbers, NGOs estimate that around 1,000 people are currently detained in the camps.
Another 600 people from Gaza arrested on Israeli soil on October 7 are being held in the Israeli prison system.
Steiner pointed out that all those detained in Gaza, including children and reportedly even an 82-year-old woman, were being held under Israel's unlawful combatants law. That law denies protections typically granted to detainees and prisoners of war.
""The law in its current form is unconstitutional,"" she said.
Steiner and Azem, both Israeli nationals, said defending Palestinians' rights in Israel had become increasingly difficult since October 7, and that they had faced threats and verbal abuse.
""It's not an easy place to be,"" Steiner said.
The trauma caused by Hamas's attack and the frantic concern over the fate of the hostages is understandable, she said, but ""that does not give you an excuse to torture"".
""This is not just the question of us versus them. This is us versus us,"" Steiner said.
""If Israel can prove that it holds even the worst of its enemies in humane conditions, that will be a triumph.""",Saturday 16 March 2024 - 19:35pm
"UN chief, at Gaza crossing, appeals for end to war's 'nightmare'","GAZA - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, on a visit to the doorstep of war-ravaged Gaza, on Saturday said the world has seen enough of its horrors and appealed for a ceasefire to allow in more aid.
He spoke at the crossing on the Egyptian side of Rafah, where most of Gaza's population has sought refuge but Israel vows to send in ground troops against Hamas militants, despite the fears of Guterres and other global leaders.
""Palestinians in Gaza -- children, women, men -- remain stuck in a non-stop nightmare,"" Guterres said. ""I carry the voices of the vast majority of the world who have seen enough"".
Despite warnings that a Rafah operation would cause mass civilian casualties and worsen the humanitarian crisis gripping Gaza after nearly six months of war between Israel and Hamas, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he will press ahead with the attack.
But his government is under growing international pressure to ease its bombardment and ground offensive, which the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza says has killed at least 32,142 people.
The war began on October 7 when an unprecedented attack from Gaza by Hamas militants resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
Israel vowed to destroy the militants, who also seized about 250 hostages, of whom Israel believes around 130 remain in Gaza, including 33 presumed dead.Large parts of the territory have been reduced to rubble and the World Food Programme on Monday said Gazans are already ""starving to death"", with famine projected by May in northern Gaza without urgent intervention.
Writing on social media platform X on Friday, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, said the aid ""Israeli authorities are allowing in is still by far not enough"".
Currently, an average of 150 trucks a day enter Gaza, he said, compared with at least 500 before the war.
In the face of limited ground access, several nations have begun aid airdrops, and a sea corridor from Cyprus delivered its first cargo of food.
Israel has blamed shortages on the Palestinian side, namely a lack of capacity to distribute aid once it gets in.
Israel's most staunch ally the United States, which provides it with billions of dollars in military aid, has repeatedly blocked Gaza ceasefire resolutions at the UN Security Council. 
But Washington has also become increasingly vocal about the war's impact on civilians. On Friday it tried to pass a text mentioning an ""immediate ceasefire as part of a hostage deal"", but China and Russia vetoed the US text.
The Gaza health ministry, in its latest toll on Saturday, reported at least 72 people killed overnight.
 
- 'Precise' -
 
Israeli forces continued operations in and around Gaza's biggest hospital complex, Al-Shifa, for a sixth day on Saturday.
The army said a total of more than 170 militants had been killed, more than 800 suspects questioned, and weapons found.
The ""precise"" operation is being conducted without harm to civilians or medical personnel, the army said.The UN's humanitarian agency, OCHA, said ""health workers have been among those reported arrested and detained.""
Mohammed, 59, who lives a short walk from the Al-Shifa complex in Gaza City, told AFP he had seen ""many bodies"" in the streets, buildings on fire and tanks blocking the roads.
""I feel that Gaza has become worse than the fires of hell,"" he said, giving only his first name.
 
- 'Up in flames' -
 
Netanyahu on Friday reiterated his plan to send ground troops into the southern city of Rafah.
""I hope to do that with the support of the United States, but if we need to, we will do it alone,"" Netanyahu told visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
Netanyahu has said repeatedly that a ground invasion of Rafah is the only way to root out Hamas, but global leaders have warned that an incursion would worsen an already catastrophic situation.
In Rafah on Saturday, Guterres said: ""Any further onslaught will make things even worse.""
Blinken said he would continue discussions with Israeli officials to find an alternative to a ground incursion of Rafah.
Even without ground troops, Rafah is suffering regular bombardments.Members of the Kawari family, who had taken refuge in Rafah after fleeing from Gaza City, told AFP a ""huge explosion"" killed four children and their grandmother during an air strike early Saturday.
""The entire house is destroyed. It went up in flames,"" said Fawzy Kawari, a relative of those who died.
To the north of Rafah, in Khan Yunis city on Friday, the Barbakh family mourned relatives killed in strikes -- and expressed anger at both Israel and Hamas.
""We want to understand what's the purpose of this war?"" said Samih Barbakh. He accused Israeli forces of ""annihilating us,"" before addressing a complaint to Hamas's self-exiled leader Ismail Haniyeh over the shortage of basic foods.
""Where are you Haniyeh?"" Barbakh asked, saying a carton of eggs has risen tenfold in price ""and it's not even available.""
Blinken toured the region to bolster truce talks in Qatar, where mediators are aiming to secure a deal likely to involve militants freeing hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody and the delivery of more relief supplies.The top US diplomat accused China and Russia of ""cynically"" blocking Washington's Security Council resolution, which linked a truce to the release of hostages.
Russia and China, along with Arab nations, said the US text was too soft on Israel and diplomatic sources said a tougher resolution was expected to be put to a vote in New York on Monday.

Israel faces growing pressure over Gaza ground operation plans,"GAZA - Israel faced growing international pressure Wednesday to rethink plans for a massive ground operation in Gaza where the Hamas-run health ministry says Israel's relentless bombing campaign has killed 700 people in 24 hours.
Alarm is growing over the spiralling death toll in the Gaza Strip, which Israel has been bombarding since October 7 when Hamas gunmen poured across the border killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping 222 others, officials say.
More than 6,500 Palestinians have been killed, mostly civilians, and there are fears the toll could soar if Israel pushes ahead with a widely expected ground invasion in a bid to destroy Hamas and rescue the hostages.
""A massive intervention that would put civilian lives at risk would be a mistake,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said in Cairo after meeting Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who also warned a ground operation would cause ""many, many civilian casualties"".
It would also ""be unlikely to offer Israel long-term protection"" and would be incompatible with respecting ""international humanitarian law and the rules of war"", Macron said. His remarks came as alarm grew over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza where hospitals are facing ""complete collapse"", a top Palestinian medic warned.
The United Nations said 12 of the territory's 35 hospitals have closed due to damage or insufficient fuel. 
""The hospitals are in a state of complete collapse,"" said Mohammed Abu Selmeya, head of Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the largest in the territory.
He told AFP that ""more than 90 percent of medicines"" had run out.
Israel has cut off Gaza's usual water, food and other supplies, and fewer than 70 relief trucks have entered the impoverished territory since the war began.
None contained fuel, which Israel fears Hamas will use for weapons and explosives.
Violence has also risen sharply in the occupied West Bank, where health officials said more than 100 Palestinians had been killed, mostly in raids by Israeli troops or in clashes with Israeli settlers.
 
- 'Right to respond' -
 
US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday ""Israel has a right... to respond to the slaughter of its people"", but said Washington's close ally must follow the laws of war and do everything it can to protect civilians.US media have reported that Biden has pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on a ground invasion while Hamas still holds hostages, but he denied it.
""It's their decision,"" Biden told a press conference. ""I did not demand it. I put it out to him.""
The World Health Organization called for Hamas to provide proof of life for the hostages it is holding and release them all on health grounds.
""There is an urgent need for... the immediate release, on humanitarian and health grounds, of all those abducted,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.
Biden also cast doubt on civilian casualty figures put forward by Hamas.
""I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's a price of waging war,"" he said, ""but I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.""
Meanwhile, a divided UN Security Council was to vote on competing draft resolutions on the Gaza war drawn up by Russia and the United States at a meeting due to start at 1900 GMT, diplomats said.
The Russian document, seen by AFP, calls for ""an immediate, durable and fully respected humanitarian ceasefire"" and ""condemns all violence and hostilities against civilians"" and also says it ""rejects and condemns the heinous attacks by Hamas"" of October 7.
The new American draft defends ""the inherent right of all States to individual and collective self-defence"", and calls for ""humanitarian pauses"" to let aid into Gaza. It does not mention a ceasefire.
 
- Crippling fuel shortage -
 
Aid agencies have warned that more people will die if medical equipment, water desalination plants and ambulances stop operating because of a lack of fuel.
Once the generators stop, hospitals will ""turn into morgues"", the Red Cross has warned.
Hospitals are also struggling with a shortage of medicines and equipment.""There's not enough anaesthetic,"" said Ahmad Abdul Hadi, an orthopaedic surgeon working at Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis.
""The wounded are in severe pain but we can't wait for the procedure so we're forced to do the operation. We performed a number of surgeries without anaesthetic. It's tough and painful, but with the lack of resources, what can we do?""
UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, has also said its operations were at breaking point from the shortage of fuel. 
""If we do not get fuel urgently, we will be forced to halt our operations in the Gaza Strip as of (Wednesday) night,"" it said on Tuesday.
 
- Regional 'explosion' -
 
The war has sparked fears of a regional conflagration if it draws in more of Israel's enemies, with Iran's top diplomat on Wednesday accusing Israel of carrying out ""genocide"" in Gaza.
The strikes on Gaza are ""a campaign for the genocide of the Palestinian people"", Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in a letter addressed to UN human rights chief Volker Turk and shared on social media by his ministry.
Jordan's King Abdullah became the latest leader to warn that ongoing violence could ""lead to an explosion"" in the region, and his wife Queen Rania accused Western leaders of a ""glaring double standard"" for not condemning Israel's killing of Palestinian civilians in its bombardment of Gaza.And Netanyahu on Wednesday acknowledged for the first time he would have to give ""answers"" for security lapses exposed in the deadly Hamas attacks.
""The fault will be examined and everyone will have to give answers, including me. But all this will happen later,"" he said in a televised address.
With tens of thousands of Israeli troops massed at the Gaza border, the premier said ""we are preparing the ground offensive"" without elaborating.

Israeli troops battle Hamas in main southern Gaza city,"Israeli forces battled Hamas militants in southern Gaza on Tuesday, prompting a UN warning of an ""even more hellish scenario"" as fighting pushes civilians into a steadily shrinking area of the besieged territory.
After an air and ground assault that has displaced hundreds of thousands and reduced much of northern Gaza to rubble, Israel has now sent tanks and troops into the south as well, including the second-largest city Khan Yunis.
Israel says it aims to destroy Hamas and free hostages taken in unprecedented October 7 cross-border attacks.""We are in the heart of Jabalia, in the heart of Shejaiya (in northern Gaza), and now also in the heart of Khan Yunis,"" the army's Southern Command chief Major General Yaron Finkelman said on what he called ""the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation"" in late October.
Israeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen near Khan Yunis, forcing already displaced civilians to pack up and flee again, witnesses told AFP.
The Hamas-run health ministry said 25 people died in a strike on a school where displaced people were sheltering.
Ambulances, trucks and other vehicles delivered bloodied, dust-covered casualties to Khan Yunis's Nasser hospital, including children.
""My cousin called me and told me to come because my sister's body was lying in a schoolyard,"" resident Mohammed Salou told AFP. 
With Hamas leaders still at large and 138 hostages still in militant hands according to Israel, army chief Herzi Halevi said ""military pressure... is severely damaging Hamas"" and helping the push to free captives.
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group's October 7 attacks that it says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw around 240 hostages taken.The latest toll from the Hamas-run government media office said 16,248 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, had been killed.
""The situation is getting worse by the hour,"" said Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization's representative in the Palestinian territories, urging ""a sustained ceasefire"" after almost two months of war.
""We are close by humanity's darkest hour,"" Peeperkorn told reporters via video link from Rafah in southern Gaza.
 
- 'Panic and anxiety' -
 International aid organisations have warned that civilians in the densely populated Strip are running out of places to flee to.
""Nowhere is safe in Gaza and there is nowhere left to go,"" said Lynn Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories.
""If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond,"" Hastings said in a statement.
The Norwegian Refugee Council aid group said the violence in Gaza ""now ranks amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age"".
""Countries supporting Israel with arms must understand that these civilian deaths will be a permanent stain on their reputation,"" the organisation's chief Jen Egeland said in a statement, also warning of the dire public health ramifications of the rainy season.Their belongings piled onto donkey carts, battered vehicles and even camels, Gazans headed south to try to escape the expanding Israeli offensive.
An estimated 1.8 million people are displaced in Gaza -- roughly three-quarters of the population, according to UN figures.
An Israeli order for people to move from Khan Yunis to the southern city of Rafah ""created panic, fear and anxiety"", according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
People were being pushed into an area that is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip, with roads to the south clogged, he said.In northern Gaza, the military said it had encircled the Jabalia refugee camp and also raided a Hamas Internal Security Forces command and control centre.
It said the number of Israeli soldiers killed since the war began had risen to 82.
And in Israel, sirens blared in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv warning of incoming rocket fire.
 
- Communications 'return' -
 US President Joe Biden called for the condemnation of ""sexual violence"" committed by Hamas, after allegations of rape during the October 7 attacks, which the militant group denies.
The United States has also cautioned Israel to do more to avert civilian casualties.
And US aid chief Samantha Power announced $21 million in new assistance for Gazans during a visit to neighbouring Egypt, including hygiene shelter and food supplies. 
Israel on Monday said it was not seeking to force Palestinian civilians to permanently leave their homes, and was seeking support from aid groups to provide shelter in a tiny coastal area of Gaza named Al-Mawasi.
Fighting has resumed after the collapse on Friday of a Qatar-mediated truce that saw scores of Israeli and other hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
Marking the 60th day since the hostages were taken, a group of former captives met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
""I heard heartbreaking stories, of hunger and thirst, of children whispering in fear,"" Netanyahu told reporters.
On the fighting, he hailed the ""immense power"" of the military campaign, saying ""the earth shook in Khan Yunis and Jabalia.""
An Israeli official claimed Hamas drugged hostages with sedatives so they appeared ""calm and happy"" when released. Hamas has ruled out further releases until a permanent ceasefire is agreed.
Qatar's ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, said his country was ""constantly working to renew"" the truce and denounced what he called ""shameful"" international inaction over the war.
The war has sparked fears of a wider regional conflict, with frequent exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah across Israel's border with Lebanon.
The occupied West Bank has also seen a surge in violence. 
The killing of a 25-year-old, Mohammed Youssef Manasra, in an Israeli raid on Qalandia refugee camp added to more than 250 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since October, according to Palestinian authorities.burs-er/ami

First aid boat unloads in Gaza as Hamas proposes new truce,"GAZA CITY - A first aid ship plying a new maritime corridor from Cyprus began unloading its cargo of desperately needed food in Gaza on Friday as Hamas proposed a new six-week truce in the war.
AFP footage showed the Open Arms, which set sail from Cyprus on Tuesday, towing a barge that the Spanish charity of the same name says is loaded with 200 tonnes of food for Gazans threatened with famine after more than five months of war.
World Central Kitchen, the US charity working with Open Arms, said it was readying another boat with supplies of beans, canned meat, flour, rice and dates in the Cypriot port of Larnaca but stressed the need for more road access to bring aid into Gaza.
""Our ambition is having a highway of aid going into Gaza,"" the group's Juan Camilo Jimenez said in a video posted on social media platform X.
The Israeli military said it had deployed troops to ""secure the area"" around the jetty while the cargo of aid was unloaded. The ""vessel underwent a comprehensive security inspection,"" it said.
A spokesman for the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry said early on Saturday that 123 people had been killed across Gaza in the past 24 hours, including 36 people in a strike on a house sheltering displaced people in central Nuseirat.
In negotiations aimed at securing a new truce and hostage deal, Hamas has put forward a new proposal for a six-week ceasefire and the exchange of several dozen Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, an official from the militant group told AFP. 
Hamas would want this to lead to ""a complete (Israeli) withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and a permanent ceasefire"", the official said.
The proposal would involve the release of some 42 hostages, who would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners at a ratio of between 20 and 50 prisoners per hostage, the official said, down from a previous proposal of roughly 100 to one.
Palestinian militants seized about 250 Israeli and foreign hostages during the Hamas attack of October 7, dozens of whom were released during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes about 130 captives remain in Gaza, including 32 presumed dead.
Israel said it was sending a delegation to Qatar for a new round of negotiations.",Friday 15 March 2024 - 09:30am
First wounded escape war-torn Gaza for Egypt,"GAZA - Ambulances transported wounded residents out of Gaza for urgent medical care in Egypt Wednesday, with hundreds of desperate foreign passport holders also poised to flee the territory wracked by three weeks of bombardment by Israel.
READ: Ground battles rage in Gaza as concern grows for hospitals
The evacuation of the first people to escape war-torn Gaza provided a rare glimmer of hope in an otherwise desolate humanitarian crisis, with 8,796 people killed in Israeli bombing, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to ""continue until victory"" over Hamas, whose brutal 7 October attack sparked the latest conflict.
AFP reporters saw a phalanx of 40 white ambulances streaming through the Rafah border crossing, as crowds of foreign and dual national families gathered nearby, hoping to leave the catastrophic conditions of Gaza behind them.Jordanian citizen Saleh Hussein said she received word in the middle of the night that she was on the list for evacuation.
""We've faced many problems in Gaza, the least of which were the shortage of water and the power outage. There were bigger problems such as the bombardment. We were afraid. Many families were martyred,"" she told AFP.
AFPTV images showed whole families, struggling to carry their worldly possessions, rushing through the heavily fortified crossing towards Egypt, which was expected to admit at least 400 foreign passport holders and 90 of the most badly wounded and sick.
""It's enough. We've endured enough humiliation,"" said Gaza resident Rafik al-Hilou, accompanying relatives including children aged one and four.
""We lack the most basic human needs. No internet, no phones, no means of communication, not even water. For the past four days, we haven't been able to feed this child a piece of bread. What are you waiting for?""
Israel has relentlessly pounded Gaza in retribution for the worst attack in the country's history, when Hamas gunmen stormed across the border, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials.AFP reporters saw more tanks pour over the border into northern Gaza, as Israel stepped up its ground incursion launched late last week.
Images provided by the military showed troops picking through bombed-out houses searching for militants or some of the 240 hostages seized by Hamas.
Israel said 11 soldiers died in ground fighting in Gaza on Tuesday, taking to 326 the number of troops killed since 7 October.
 
- 'An earthquake' -
 
The temporary border opening with Egypt provided the first glimmer of hope in the flaring humanitarian crisis in Gaza which the UN and other aid agencies have described as ""unprecedented"".A strike on Gaza's largest refugee camp killed at least 47 people Tuesday -- including a Hamas commander involved in the October 7 attacks, according to Israel.
Horrified resident Ragheb Aqal, 41, likened the blast to ""an earthquake"" and spoke of seeing ""homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers"".
Israel said its warplanes had hit a ""vast"" tunnel complex at the site, killing ""many Hamas terrorists"", including local battalion commander Ibrahim Biari.
But the strike sparked a chorus of condemnation from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and also further afield in Bolivia, which cut off diplomatic ties in protest -- a decision Israel labelled ""surrender to terrorism"".
Hamas said seven hostages, including three foreign passport holders, had died in the bombing, a claim impossible to verify.
 
- 'No hope in Gaza' -
 The situation in Gaza remained desperate, with food, fuel, and medicine for the 2.4 million residents all running short, according to aid groups.
Palestinian residents told AFP they had evacuated from northern Gaza, as demanded by Israel, but were still under threat.
""We've been told people are evacuating from Gaza City towards the central area of the Strip beyond the valley, so we headed there. After 20 days, we were bombarded. Three of our kids lost their lives and we all got injured,"" Amen al-Aqluk told AFP.""There is no hope in the Gaza Strip. It is not safe anymore here. When the border opens, everybody will leave and emigrate. We encounter death everyday, 24 hours a day.""
Israeli officials said 70 aid trucks entered Gaza from Egypt Tuesday, one of the biggest ever daily flows, but far less than humanitarian groups say is needed.
Fearing supplies entering Gaza could be diverted to Hamas, or that aid shipments could conceal arms, Israeli security personnel carry out stringent inspections that have slowed the flow of aid to a trickle.
 
- 'We have no more tears' -
 With fears mounting the violence could spiral into a regional war, US President Joe Biden called for ""urgent mechanisms"" to dial down tensions and said top diplomat Antony Blinken would embark on another Middle East tour from Friday.
Turkey and Iran called for a regional conference to prevent a conflagration, as Israel faces a daily barrage of aerial attacks from Hamas and other Iran-backed groups around the Middle East, including Yemen's Huthi rebels.
In the north, Israel has traded near-daily fire with Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.
And the families of hostages kidnapped by Hamas endure an unbearable wait for news of relatives thought to be held in the labyrinth of tunnels deep below Gaza.
Ayelet Sella, whose seven cousins were kidnapped from one of the kibbutz communities raided by Hamas gunmen, said she could find ""no rest"" until her loved ones are returned.
""We have no more tears, our eyes are dry, we are empty three weeks on,"" said Sella, speaking to AFP at the Great Synagogue in Paris. ""I only ask for one thing, that they come back.""

"Babies, over-80s, entire families: the Gaza hostages","Following the announcement that Gaza militant group Hamas will release at least 50 hostages as part of a deal with Israel, here is what we know about the captives.
Based on interviews with relatives and Israeli media reports, AFP has confirmed the identities of 210 of the around 240 people abducted on October 7 during Hamas attacks on military posts, communities and a desert music festival.
The hostages, who are set for staggered release in return for a four-day truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners, are women and children and included both Israelis and foreigners.
The United States has said that three Americans, including three-year-old Abigail Mor Idan, will be among the first captives to be released starting Thursday.
""One or two"" French hostages are also due for release, French lawmaker Meyer Habib told a French Jewish radio station.
Four female hostages have already been released by Hamas and one female soldier was rescued by Israeli forces.
Two others were found dead by Israeli forces in Gaza -- 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano and Yehudit Weiss, a 65-year-old former nurse.
- Baby, birthdays -At least 35 of those taken hostage were children, with 18 of them aged 10 or under at the time of the Hamas attack.
One of the youngest hostages is Kfir Bibas, a boy who was just nine months old when gunmen snatched him from Nir Oz kibbutz near the Gaza border, along with his four-year-old brother Ariel and his parents Yarden and Shiri.
Shiri appears in a video from the day of the attack seen by the family, cradling her children in her arms with gunmen all around her.
Some of the children have had their birthdays in captivity. Campaigners held a birthday party in London last week for an Irish-Israeli girl, Emily Hand, who turned nine in captivity.
She had been on a sleepover at a friend's house in Beeri kibbutz when she was snatched, her father said.
Yoni Asher, whose wife Doron, daughters Raz, four, and Aviv, two, and mother-in-law Efrat were snatched from Nir Oz kibbutz, has left his job as a property developer to devote all his time to bringing his family home.
They were seen in a video being taken away by militants in the back of a pick-up truck.
Twelve-year-old Eitan Yahalomi is one of at least three Israel-French children being held.
His uncle Ari Levi, who took part in a march from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem last week to press for the hostages' release, vowed: ""When Eitan comes home, I'll buy him the best bike in the world.""
- Octogenarians and whole families -
At least 68 of those abducted were women, including Yaffa Adar, who was 85 when she was filmed being whisked away from Nir Oz kibbutz in what appeared to be a golf cart.
At least eight of the hostages are aged over 80. Nine people were taken from a family in Nir Oz kibbutz, which had at least 71 of its around 400 residents abducted -- the highest number for a single community.
Sharon Aloni Cunio, 34, her husband David, 33, and their twin three-year-old daughters Emma and Yuly, were all seized on October 7.
So were David's brother Ariel, Ariel's partner Arbel Yahod and her brother Dolev and Sharon's sister Danielle and Danielle's five-year-old daughter Amelia.
Danielle, 44, appeared in a video released by Hamas on October 30 along with two other women named in a statement by Netanyahu as Yelena Trupanov and Rimon Kirsht.
In the video, Aloni urged Netanyahu to agree a prisoner exchange with the Palestinians.
- Many nationalities -
Apart from Israel, 26 countries have citizens among the hostages, according to figures from the Israeli foreign ministry. Many are dual nationals.
Twenty-six Thais were abducted along with 21 Argentines, 18 Germans, 10 US citizens, seven French and seven Russians, according to figures provided by their governments.
- Proof of life -Hamas has released two proof-of-life videos, one of Aloni and two other women, and an earlier clip showing French-Israeli woman Mia Shem, 21, pleading for help.
Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group in Gaza, on November 9 released a video it said showed two other hostages -- Hannah Katzir, a woman in her 70s, and Yagil Yaakov, 13.
Between 15 and 30 other people, mostly foreigners, are still considered missing, according to Israeli media.
They are believed to have either been taken captive or to have been killed on October 7 but have not yet been identified.

Israel under pressure from allies as Gaza war rages on,"Israel was facing mounting international pressure Wednesday over its war in Gaza, with even key backer the United States criticising the ""indiscriminate"" bombing.
Now in its third month, the war was launched in response to the unprecedented attacks on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7. 
It has left Gaza in ruins, killing more than 18,400 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and causing ""unparalleled"" damage to its roads, schools and hospitals. 
The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly backed a non-binding resolution for a ceasefire on Tuesday.But more air strikes hit Gaza and gun battles again raged through the night, especially in Gaza City, the biggest urban centre, and Khan Yunis and Rafah in the south, AFP correspondents said.
Cold autumn rains lashed the territory, where millions have been displaced and many are living in makeshift plastic tents, as vital supplies of food, drinking water, medicines and fuel have run low in more than two months of siege and war.
Air raid sirens wailed in Sderot and other southern Israeli communities near Gaza as militants kept firing rockets, most of which have been intercepted by air defences.
The army said an air strike had hit a militant cell in Gaza City's Shejaiya district ""that was en route to launch rockets toward Israel"".
In Khan Yunis, a centre of heavy urban combat in recent days, a family gathered to mourn the death in a strike of Fayez al-Taramsi, a father of seven.
""How are we going to live after him?"" one of his daughters said, crying and clutching his bloodied shirt. ""He brought us to life.""The bloodiest-ever Gaza war broke out after Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on October 7, killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel, determined to destroy Hamas and bring the hostages home, launched a devastating aerial and ground offensive on Gaza.
The Hamas-run health ministry said Wednesday that at least 50 more people killed in the latest wave of air strikes.
Israel said it has lost 115 soldiers, including 10 in northern Gaza on Tuesday, its deadliest day since launching the ground assault on October 27.
- 'Diminishing safe space' -While the United States and Israel voted against the resolution, it was supported by US allies Australia, Canada and New Zealand, who, in a rare joint statement, said they were ""alarmed at the diminishing safe space for civilians in Gaza"".
Biden said at a campaign event that Israel had ""most of the world supporting it"" immediately after the October 7 attack, but that ""they're starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place"".Toning down his comments at a later news conference, the US president reiterated support for Israel and said only that ""the safety of innocent Palestinians is still of great concern"".
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was ""disagreement"" with Biden over how a post-conflict Gaza would be governed.
The UN vote came after the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, described the situation in Gaza as ""hell on earth"".
- Gaza City hospital raid -
The UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced and were receiving goods from only around 100 aid trucks per day. Its hospital system is in ruins, and Hamas authorities said Wednesday that vaccines for children had run out, warning of ""catastrophic health repercussions"".
The UN's satellite analysis agency UNOSAT said 18 percent of Gaza's infrastructure had been destroyed based on an image that was already more than two weeks old. 
The World Bank in a new analysis warned that ""the loss of life, speed and extent of damages... are unparalleled"".
Already by mid-November, almost half of all roads and around 60 percent of communication infrastructure, health and education facilities had been damaged or destroyed, it said.Hamas said Israeli forces raided a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday. UN humanitarian agency OCHA had earlier reported fighting nearby and said about 3,000 displaced people were trapped inside.
The army did not comment, but Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals, schools, mosques and vast tunnel systems beneath them as military bases -- claims the group has denied.The UN World Health Organization's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was ""extremely worried"" by reports of the raid, adding that his agency ""urgently calls for the protection of all persons inside the hospital"".
Fears of a wider conflict continued to grow, with daily exchanges of fire along Israel's border with Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based, and other Iran-backed groups targeting US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria.
Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels have repeatedly launched missiles and drones toward Israel and cargo ships in nearby waters that they suspect are working with Israel.

"Egypt's Sisi rejects Gaza refugee influx, blames Israel for aid block","Egypt's president said Wednesday he would not allow any mass influx of refugees from Gaza, saying it would set a precedent for ""the displacement of Palestinians from the West Bank into Jordan"".
After talks with visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi blamed Israel's air strikes on the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt for the failure to get aid to the territory's 2.4 million people.
""The displacement of Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt means the same displacement will take place for Palestinians from the West Bank into Jordan,"" Sisi warned.
""Subsequently, the Palestinian state that we are talking about and that the world is talking about will become impossible to implement -- because the land is there, but the people are not. Therefore, I warn of the danger of this matter.""
Sisi's meeting with the German chancellor came as Gaza faced a 12th straight day of ferocious Israeli bombardment in retaliation for a shock cross-border attack launched by Hamas on October 7 that killed at least 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
About 3,000 people have been killed in Gaza, which is nearly out of electricity, food, water and fuel.
Pressure has mounted for aid to be allowed in through Egypt's Rafah crossing with Gaza, the only access to the besieged territory not controlled by Israel.
Sisi said Egypt ""did not close"" the crossing, but that ""developments on the ground and the repeated bombings by Israel of the Palestinian side of the crossing have prevented its operation"".
Hundreds of lorries carrying aid have been waiting for six days on the Egyptian side of the crossing, which Israeli aircraft has bombed four times.
Scholz told reporters Berlin and Cairo ""are working together to get humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip as quickly as possible.""
The two men also warned against the threat of regional spillover, with the Egyptian president calling for ""immediate international intervention"" to put a stop to ""dangerous military escalation that may get out of control"".
Scholz reiterated that Germany sought to avoid a ""conflagration in the Middle East"" and warned Hezbollah and Iran ""once again not to intervene in this conflict"".
- Peace could 'fall apart' -
In 1979, Egypt became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel following the Camp David accords of the previous year.
That peace is at risk of disintegrating, Sisi said, if there is a mass exodus of Gazans to Egypt's neighbouring Sinai Peninsula that would risk turning it into ""a new base for terrorist operations against Israel"".
""Israel would have the right to defend itself and its national security, and therefore direct strikes on Egyptian lands,"" he said.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas too has warned that the displacement of Gazans to Egypt would amount to a ""second Nakba"" -- when more than 760,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their lands during the war that accompanied Israel's creation in 1948.
Most of Gaza's population are refugees from that exodus.
Egypt has repeatedly refused to accept what it calls the transfer of Israel's responsibility as an occupying power, including to ""provide for the safety of civilians"" living under its occupation.
Dismissing comments by pundits about Sinai being a sparsely populated desert area, Sisi suggested Israel's Negev Desert as an alternative refuge for Gazans.
""Palestinians could be moved there until Israel is finished with what it has declared is an operation to eliminate armed groups"" from Gaza, the president said.
""And then it could return them if it wished,"" he added.",Wednesday 18 October 2023 - 16:25pm
Israeli-Palestinian peace camp shaken but determined,"The Israel-Palestinian peace camp has long promoted dialogue against hatred and bloodshed but the passions inflamed by the deadliest Gaza war yet pose entirely new challenges for the movement.  
Many of its activists believe that talking to each other is now more important than ever, at a time when the fighting rages unabated and both sides mourn their dead. 
""It wasn't easy before the war,"" said Sulaiman Khatib of Fighters for Peace, a group he co-founded in 2006 and whose Israeli and Palestinian members hold weekly meetings and frequent protests.
""But now it's even more difficult, starting with the relationship with each of the societies, both in Israel and in Palestine, where the extremes have risen.""
The Gaza war has brought levels of suffering unusual even by the brutal standards of the decades-old conflict that has seen two Palestinian uprisings and four previous Gaza wars. 
Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, mutilating corpses and dragging some 240 hostages back into the blockaded territory.
Israel has responded with an intense air and ground war that has levelled vast areas of Gaza and claimed more than 13,000 lives according to the Hamas government, while its 2.4 million people endure a punishing siege.
One recent evening, a small group of around 40 Israeli and Palestinian activists gathered by the walls of Jerusalem's Old City to observe 15 minutes' silence for ""all the dead"". 
Standing with their eyes closed or crying, or sitting cross-legged, they listened to Jewish and Christian prayers under the gaze of often sceptical passers-by. 
One onlooker remarked in an angry whisper, ""How dare the Arabs do that?""
- 'Dehumanisation at a high' -
The peace camp has always made some people bristle on both sides and become ever more marginalised. 
Yet it still counts more than 200 organisations, some more than 40 years old. 
Among their ranks are environmentalists for peace, motorists who drive Palestinians to visit doctors in Israel, and joint Israeli-Palestinian choirs.
They remain convinced that they have been right to advocate dialogue. 
One group, the Circle of Parents, is made up of Israeli and Palestinian families bereaved by the conflict. 
""I already see people who may come and join us after so much violence,"" said its co-director Yuval Rahamim, based in Tel Aviv.
""It will be part of the personal process for some.""
Most activists, initially stunned into silence by the October 7 attacks, resumed their discussion groups a few days later.
It hasn't been easy, they say, and not just because of logistical hurdles such as additional roadblocks in the occupied West Bank.
""It has never been that difficult to hear the other's point of view,"" said Avner Wishnitzer, another co-founder of Fighters for Peace.
In the current wartime climate, he said, all sides are torn by ""the pain, the fear"". 
""Dehumanisation is at a high point. It will intensify. People -- of course not all -- are ready to see the other side's babies killed.
""There is no place for nuance, complexity. There is a rise of extremism on both sides"".
Reflecting on the peace groups, he said, ""we are a minority, maybe a smaller minority now. The space for free speech has narrowed significantly.""
- 'People are on edge' -
The hurt from October 7 runs even deeper for some because peace activists were among the victims. One of them was Vivian Silver, a founder of Women Wage Peace, who died at Kibbutz Beeri. 
Khatib acknowledged the movement has been badly shaken and that many activists struggle with mixed and confusing emotions.
""There are many members who go to sleep consumed by frustration and wake up optimistic,"" he said. ""It's not black and white, people are on edge.
""What has happened is so staggering that we don't want to participate in a form of status quo by persisting with our old ways of doing things.""
Some non-government groups fear they will lose funding as donors reassess their relationships or redirect their cash to Gaza aid relief. 
The Alliance for Middle East Peace, with more than 160 member groups, receives distraught calls every day from its members.
Its member Nivine Sandouka urged ""an international peace fund"" to be set up, modelled on past fund-raising efforts for conflict-torn Northern Ireland. 
The group's veteran activist Doubi Schwartz said the movement will need time to find its bearings to maintain the dialogue towards peace.
""The red lines are part of the difficult and honest discussions between Israeli and Palestinian peace activists,"" he said. ""The discussion about it will last for decades. 
""The conversation we share and the ways we operate will evolve significantly. But the fact that people still want to talk to each other is something that makes me optimistic.""

Cat cafe brings pawsitivity to war-scarred Gaza,"GAZA CITY - A cat cafe in the Gaza Strip aims to ""cheer up"" Palestinian residents and offer them a respite from the trials of daily life in the blockaded territory, its owner said.
At the Meow Cat Cafe which opened this week in Gaza City, owner Nehma Maabad set out food for a clowder of kittens.
""Cats, for me, are a refuge that relieves me of psychological stress. So I thought of creating a project that combines serving people with something to cheer them up,"" said the 50-year-old.
Part of the space is kitted out with wooden platforms covered in astroturf for the cats to clamber onto, while feline murals and portraits adorn the walls.
Meow is part of a growing global trend of cat cafes, but the circumstances in Gaza are unique.
The territory has been under a crippling Israeli blockade since 2007 and scars of repeated wars fought between Palestinian militants and Israel are visible across the city.Customers pay nearly 10 shekels ($2.65) per hour to play with the cats, which Maabad said covers their food as well as costly vet bills.
Visiting the cafe, Manar Abu Samra said it was reasonably priced and she had told her friends and sisters about the new venture.
""The quality of cats here is beautiful and sweet, so it's a wonderful idea -- despite its strangeness to society -- and when I heard about it I felt happy,"" she said.
Pets are rare in Gaza although cats are ever-present, particularly around the port or fishmongers as they try to paw away some scraps.
Maabad said she had cats at home to bring to Meow, while others came from friends.
""The idea of the cafe was to have something nice with a cup of coffee,"" she said.
""A cat that you play with and it makes you smile and forget the pressures of life.""",Friday 18 August 2023 - 16:11pm
ICJ genocide decision | Unpacking ruling on Israel,"JOHANNESBURG - Following the International Court of Justice’s decision, many are asking whether Israel will now be held directly accountable for the deaths and harm caused to Palestinians in Gaza.

The vote in the 15-member council was 13-1, with the United Kingdom abstaining.

Biden to visit Israel as Gaza ground offensive looms,"TEL AVIV - President Joe Biden will make a landmark trip to Israel in an ""ironclad"" show of US support, as efforts to ease a spiralling humanitarian disaster in Gaza intensify.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the visit as a statement of ""solidarity with Israel"" and an ""ironclad commitment to its security"", just days after Hamas fighters broke through the heavily fortified border, shooting, stabbing and burning to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
Biden's visit will also seek to avert a regional conflagration with Hamas backer Iran, which on Monday warned of a possible ""pre-emptive action"" against Israel ""in the coming hours"". 
Repeated fire in recent days along Israel's northern border with Lebanon has claimed lives on both sides and compounded fears of a regional spillover of the war.
Biden's visit also comes amid frantic diplomatic efforts to ease the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza after waves of Israeli retaliatory air strikes on the Hamas-ruled enclave.
After Israel, Biden will travel to Jordan where he will meet Jordanian King Abdullah II, Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
Under relentless Israeli bombardment, thousands of Gazans have died and international agencies warn millions more face dwindling supplies of water, food and fuel -- even before a looming Israeli ground invasion.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli military leaders have signalled their intent to destroy Hamas and eradicate the threat it poses after the militant group's attack which has been likened to 9/11.
Tens of thousands of regular Israeli troops and reservists have amassed at the border waiting for the order to go in.
An Israeli military spokesman said it was unclear how Biden's visit might change the timing of an Israeli ground offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Several notable Hamas figures have already been killed in air strikes, including, on Monday, Osama Mazini, who the Israeli Air Force said was part of a top council and ""responsible for Hamas prisoners."" 
Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the United States and several other Western governments, while Israel has likened it to the Islamic State group.
But the air strikes have flattened entire neighbourhoods in the blockaded Gaza Strip and killed at least 2,750 people, most of them civilians. The bombardment, coupled with an Israeli order to evacuate the north of the Gaza Strip that borders Israel, has forced more than a million Palestinians to flee their homes for the south of the enclave since the 10-day conflict began, according to the UN agency serving Palestinian agencies (UNRWA).
International aid agencies have called for aid to urgently be allowed into the territory, and for Gaza's border with Egypt to be open to allow civilians to leave.
World Health Organization regional director Ahmed Al-Mandhari told AFP that Gaza was barrelling toward ""real catastrophe"". 
""There are 24 hours of water, electricity and fuel left"" he said. 
 
- 'Out of harm's way' -
 
Washington has backed Israel's right to strike back at Hamas, but it has also urged measures to ease the impact on ordinary Palestinians caught in the crossfire.
Speaking after marathon talks with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Blinken signalled there was no firm agreement yet on humanitarian relief.But there was a ""commitment"" to work on a nascent plan ahead of and during Biden's visit, he said.
""At our request, the United States and Israel have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza,"" Blinken said.
He said the two sides were discussing the ""possibility of creating areas to help keep civilians out of harm's way.""
Blinken said the US president hopes to ""hear from Israel how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimises civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not benefit Hamas.""
Israel has issued an ultimatum to more than one million people in northern Gaza that they should flee ahead of an expected ground offensive.
Entire families, young children and the elderly have packed what belongings they can to flee to the southern Gaza Strip, bedding down in any available space, indoors and out. 
In the city of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza the normal population of 400,000 has roughly doubled.
Thousands more Palestinians have massed at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt in an effort to flee.""The situation is catastrophic beyond what I could have imagined,"" said Jamil Abdullah, a Palestinian-Swede who is hoping to leave after being forced to sleep on the street.""There are corpses in the streets. Buildings are crashing down on their inhabitants. Blood is everywhere. The smell of the dead is everywhere."" 
AFP reporters in Gaza said morgues were overflowing, and corpses wrapped in white body bags were even being stored in an icecream truck.
But Gazans are effectively trapped, with neighbouring Arab nations fearful that if Palestinians leave the Strip they could be permanently exiled.
 
- Missing - 
 
In Israel, about 500,000 people have been displaced or evacuated from communities around the Gaza Strip and Israel's northern border with Lebanon, the Israeli military said Tuesday. 
Across the country Israelis are still reeling from what is the worst attack in the country's 75-year history, and one that shattered faith in the country's government and much-vaulted security forces.Merav Leshem Gonen is among those still anxiously waiting for news of loved ones. 
Her daughter was kidnapped at a music festival near the Gaza border on October 7, one of hundreds of hostages taken by Hamas or other groups.
""We don't know anything else. She's missing. That's all we know, and we want her back alive. We want her to come back healthy,"" she said. 
Hamas's military wing has said the group was holding 200 people, with about 50 more held by other ""resistance factions and in other places"". 
A video on the Hamas's official Telegram channel purported to show ""one of the prisoners in Gaza"" -- a young woman speaking Hebrew and receiving treatment to an arm injury. 
According to the caption, she was abducted on October 7. The video has not been verified by AFP.
 
- 'Time running out'? -
 
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the entire Middle East region was ""on the verge of the abyss"".
There are deep fears that the conflict could spread to the Palestinian West Bank or to Lebanon, drawing regional foes deeper into the conflict.
Israel on Tuesday said it had launched strikes overnight on Hezbollah ""terrorist"" targets in Lebanon. 
Iran backs Hezbollah and Hamas, but has denied involvement in the October 7 attack.
It has warned Israel about the potential for the conflict to spread in the volatile region.
Western governments, including Germany whose chancellor heads to Israel on Tuesday, have urged Tehran not to fan the flames of the conflict.""Lebanese officials have a responsibility... to do everything possible to prevent Lebanon from being dragged into"" a war with Israel, France's Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said in Beirut Monday.
But Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said ""time is running out for political solutions"".

Al Jazeera bureau chief leaves Gaza,"GAZA - Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief Wael al-Dahdouh left the Palestinian territory Tuesday, he told AFP, after Israeli strikes killed his wife, multiple children and a colleague.
READ: Hostages killed by Israel forces waved white flag
Scenes of Dahdouh mourning his family and fleeing on foot from Gaza City have been broadcast globally over the weeks since war erupted between Hamas militants and Israel on 7 October.
Speaking to an AFP journalist in southern Gaza, the 53-year-old said he had crossed the Rafah border post with Egypt.
Dahdouh said he is due to travel onwards to Qatar where he will undergo surgery for a wound sustained in an Israeli strike last month, which killed the Qatar-based network's cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa and several others.
His wife, two of their children and a grandson were killed in October bombardment of central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp, while his eldest son was killed in strikes this month targeting a car in Rafah.
Dahdouh entered Egypt along with a relative on Tuesday, after four of his children made the crossing last week, he told AFP.
Khaled Elbalshy, head of the Egyptian journalists' syndicate, said the organisation had spoken to Dahdouh after he left Gaza.
The syndicate ""thanks all the Egyptian state agencies and those who made efforts to help in the case of Wael Dahdouh and treating wounded Palestinians,"" Elbalshy wrote on Facebook.
At least 82 journalists have been killed during the war, 75 of them in Gaza, according to a tally from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
At least 24,285 Palestinians, more than 70 percent of them women, young children and adolescents, have been killed in the Gaza Strip in Israeli bombardments and ground offensive since 7 October, according to the Hamas government's health ministry.
The unprecedented Hamas attack on 7 October resulted in the death of around 1,140 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Militants also reportedly still have 250 hostages captive in Gaza, 132 of whom Israel says remain there, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.",Tuesday 16 January 2024 - 19:36pm
Israel vows Hamas's destruction after deadly assault," 
JERUSALEM - Israel pounded Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip for the fifth straight day since the militants' audacious attack and the death toll spiralled into the thousands, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed the complete destruction of the militant group.
""Every Hamas member is a dead man,"" the veteran right-wing Israeli leader said, again likening them to the Islamic State group and promising: ""We will crush them and destroy them as the world has destroyed Daesh.""
Netanyahu earlier temporarily settled his political differences and set up an emergency government including centrist former defence minister Benny Gantz for the duration of the crisis.
Saturday's surprise attack -- the worst in Israel's 75-year history -- has seen a total of 1,200 people killed in the Islamist militants' onslaught, according to Israeli forces. Most were civilians.
In Gaza, officials reported more than 1,000 people killed in Israel's sustained campaign of air and artillery strikes on the crowded Palestinian enclave, sending black smoke billowing into the sky and razing entire city blocks. 
The United Nations said 11 of its staff had been killed in Gaza since Saturday, while the International Red Cross and Red Crescent societies said it had lost five of its members.
In the occupied West Bank, at least four Palestinians were killed when armed Israeli settlers attacked a town south of Nablus, taking the death toll to 29, the Palestinian health ministry said. US President Joe Biden pledged to send more munitions and military hardware to its close ally Israel and expressed revulsion at the ""sheer evil"" of the slaughter of civilians in Hamas's unprecedented assault.
Biden also made his first call for restraint over Israel's response to the Hamas attacks, urging Israel to abide by the rules of war.
He said he had told Netanyahu it was ""really important that Israel, with all the anger and frustration... they operate by the rules of war"".
The crisis, dubbed ""Israel's 9/11"", saw Netanyahu strike a political deal with Gantz and pledge to freeze for now his government's judicial overhaul plan that has sparked unprecedented mass protests.Opposition leader Yair Lapid has not joined the temporary alliance, although the joint statement said a seat would be ""reserved"" for him in the war cabinet.
""Israel before anything else,"" Gantz wrote in a social media post, while the far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote that he ""welcomes the unity, now we must win"".
 
- Fears for hostages -
 
As the war raged on, fears mounted in Israel over the fate of at least 150 hostages -- mostly Israelis but also including foreign and dual nationals -- held in Gaza by Hamas. The group has claimed that four captives died in Israeli strikes and threatened to kill other hostages if civilian targets are bombed without advance warning from Israel.
Hamas claimed Wednesday to have released an Israeli woman and her two children it said had been detained during fighting with Israeli forces, but Israeli television networks rejected the announcement.
Concern rose over the worsening humanitarian crisis in war-torn Gaza, where Israel had levelled over 1,000 buildings and imposed a total siege, cutting off water, food and energy supplies for 2.3 million people.
The enclave's sole power plant shut down Wednesday after running out of fuel, Gaza's electricity provider said.
More than 260,000 Gaza residents have been forced from their homes, a UN aid agency said, with secretary-general of the world body, Antonio Guterres, voicing fears of a deterioration in an already dire humanitarian situation.
The European Union called for a ""humanitarian corridor"" to allow civilians to flee the enclave's fifth war in 15 years.
Arab League foreign ministers meeting in Cairo called for aid to be allowed into Gaza ""immediately"".
Israel appeared to be readying for a possible ground invasion of Gaza, but faces the threat of a multi-front war after also coming under rocket attack from militant groups in neighbouring Lebanon and Syria.
Israel again struck targets Wednesday in southern Lebanon, an area controlled by the Iran-backed Hezbollah.
On Wednesday evening, rocket sirens sounded across Israel's north, and the army said there was a suspected aerial ""infiltration"" from Lebanon. It later backtracked, blaming an ""error"".Biden, who has diverted an aircraft carrier battle group to the eastern Mediterranean, has warned Israel's enemies -- state or group -- not to get involved.
He urged Iran, which has long financially and militarily backed Hamas but insists it had no involvement in Saturday's assault, to ""be careful"".
A first US aircraft has delivered ""advanced armaments"" to southern Israel's Nevatim Airbase, the Israeli army said.
 
- 'Staggering' death toll -
 Israel has been badly shaken by the deadliest attack since its creation in 1948 and the intelligence failure that allowed more than 1,500 militants to storm through the Gaza security barrier in their coordinated land, air and sea attack on the Jewish Sabbath. 
Hamas gunmen swept into small towns and kibbutzim and indiscriminately killed residents who hid in their homes or died defending their communities.
Biden on Tuesday expressed his disgust at atrocities including murders of entire families, rapes of women and ""stomach-turning reports of babies being killed"".
The US State Department said at least 22 US citizens had been killed, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to Israel in a show of solidarity.Israeli forces have retaken more than a dozen southern towns near Gaza after days of gruelling street battles that have left the bodies of at least 1,500 Hamas militants strewn in the streets.
Army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said they had discovered ""a staggering 1,200 dead Israelis"" -- most of them civilians -- as they went house to house.
The army later reported 169 fallen Israeli soldiers.
Troops have encountered and killed several holdout Hamas militants, said Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari, including 18 on Wednesday.The Israeli army has called up 300,000 reservists for what Netanyahu has said will be a ""long and difficult"" war.
Israel's intelligence minister Gila Gamliel told AFP the war to ""uproot"" Hamas will deter militants from carrying out attacks across the world.
 
- 'In a ghost town' -
 Heavy bombardment again rained down on Gaza, where the sky was blackened and Hamas said at least 30 people were killed in overnight strikes.
Rubble, burnt out cars and broken glass covered roads in Gaza City, where bombs struck the Hamas-linked Islamic University. 
Also targeted were residential buildings, mosques, factories and shops, said Salama Marouf of the Gaza government's media office. 
Gaza resident Mazen Mohammad, 38, said his terrified family had spent the night huddled together as explosions shook the area, before emerging in the morning to assess the total devastation of their neighbourhood.""We felt like we were in a ghost town, as if we were the only survivors,"" Mohammad told AFP.
Medical supplies, including oxygen, were running low at Gaza's overwhelmed Al-Shifa hospital, said emergency room physician Mohammed Ghonim.
 
- Fear and distrust -
 Unrest has flared in the occupied West Bank, where protests have been held in solidarity with Gaza and 27 Palestinians have been killed in clashes since Saturday. 
Israeli cities have been eerily quiet and tense, with some residents noting a growing sense of fear and distrust between Jews and members of the Arab-Israeli minority.
Frantic diplomacy has continued as international and regional powers sought to prevent a wider conflagration in the Middle East.

Deadly chaos at Gaza aid distribution as WHO renews hospital warning,"An aid delivery in Gaza descended into chaos on Saturday with shots fired and a Red Crescent paramedic reporting five people killed, as almost six months of Israeli bombardment has left hundreds of thousands in the Palestinian territory in desperate need.
Israel's siege, sparked by a deadly militant attack on October 7, brings nightly air strikes and in recent days major operations around several hospitals, which it says are used by Palestinian militant groups -- claims denied by Hamas.
The World Health Organization warned on Saturday that Gaza had just 10 ""minimally functioning"" hospitals for its more than two million people, with its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying around 9,000 patients urgently needed treatment abroad.UN agencies have warned repeatedly that the northern part of Gaza is on the verge of famine and called it a man-made crisis because aid lorries are backed up on the Egypt-Gaza border awaiting long checks by Israeli officials. Israel has denied responsibility.
The top UN court has ordered Israel to allow in aid and the UN Security Council has adopted a resolution demanding an ""immediate ceasefire"" but neither has affected the situation on the ground.
Israel and Hamas have been unable to agree a truce in indirect talks in Qatar, with each side blaming the other for the failure to reach a deal.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved a new round of talks on Friday with negotiators expected to resume their work on Monday.
- 'Not enough aid' -
A Red Crescent paramedic at a nearby hospital said five people were killed and dozens injured by gunfire and a stampede during a rare aid distribution in north Gaza, which has received the least help.Witnesses told AFP shots were fired both by Gazans overseeing the aid delivery and Israeli troops nearby, and panicked lorry drivers drove quickly away, hitting people trying to get the food. The Israeli military told AFP it had ""no record of the incident described"".
Aid deliveries have become increasingly fraught as the needs of Gazans increase.Foreign powers have ramped up airdrops of aid but several people have been killed by falling crates, or stampedes or drowned trying to retrieve packages from the Mediterranean.
Two charities have organised aid deliveries by sea, with their second mission in just over two weeks setting sail from Cyprus on Saturday.
Their flotilla is carrying around 400 tonnes of supplies.
""There is not enough aid getting through to Gaza and we need to open as many ways as possible,"" Juan Camilo of World Central Kitchens, one of the charities, said in a video shot from the flotilla and posted on social media.
UN agencies have said repeatedly that overland deliveries are the only way of supplying aid in the volume needed.
Palestinian Dalia al-Afifi, displaced to Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, has constructed a home from the cans received in aid packages to ""make a point to the world"" about the plight of the territory.
""This must stop. Our lives are not just cans,"" she told AFP.The Israeli bombardment continued apace into Saturday with the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip saying at least 82 people were killed overnight.
The Hamas press office said ""civilian houses"" had been hit by dozens of Israeli strikes. The Israeli military said it had struck dozens of targets including militants and their compounds.
The war began with Hamas's October 7 attack that resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 32,705 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.
- Netanyahu under pressure -
With the health situation increasingly dire, Tedros said roughly 9,000 patients needed to leave Gaza for ""lifesaving health services, including treatment for cancer, injuries from bombardments, kidney dialysis and other chronic conditions"".The WHO said Gaza had 36 hospitals before the war but now had only 10.
Israel's military accuses Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant group of hiding inside medical facilities, using patients, staff and displaced people for cover -- charges the militants have denied.
The army said Saturday it ""continued to eliminate"" militants around Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, with around 200 reported killed after 13 days of its operation.
Hamas said Saturday Israeli troops were also continuing their ""aggression"" against Nasser Hospital and were besieging Al-Amal Hospital, both in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
In their October attack, Palestinian militants seized about 250 hostages. Israel believes about 130 remain in Gaza, including 34 who are presumed dead.
Netanyahu is under domestic pressure, facing regular demonstrations over his failure to bring home all the captives.
""Prime minister, on behalf of the hostage men and women, on behalf of the people of Israel, give the negotiators in Qatar the order. Do not return without a deal,"" said former hostage Raz Ben Ami during a rally in Tel Aviv.
A central plank in the truce talks in Qatar has been negotiating the release of the hostages alongside a truce and access for humanitarian aid.The US is Israel's chief military backer, but tensions has been mounting with the US urging Netanyahu not to launch a full ground invasion of Rafah, the southern Gaza city where most of the population have fled.
The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed officials, that Washington had nonetheless approved billions of dollars of bombs and fighter jets for Israel in recent days.

"Gaza deaths top 24,000 as war drags on","GAZA - Health officials in Hamas-run Gaza reported on Monday more than 24,000 deaths in the war with Israel which has sent shockwaves across the region, as the fighting passed the grim 100-day milestone.
WATCH | Global day of action for lasting ceasefire in Gaza
Deadly violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and along Israel's border with Lebanon as well as strikes by US forces and Iran-backed Yemeni rebels in the Red Sea have raised fears of an escalation beyond the Gaza Strip.
The war, sparked by Palestinian attacks on Israel, has created a humanitarian catastrophe for the 2.4 million people in the besieged strip, the United Nations and aid groups warn, and reduced much of the territory to rubble.
The health ministry in Gaza, ruled by Hamas since 2007, reported more than 60 ""martyrs"" overnight, in what the group's media office described as ""intense"" Israeli bombardment across Gaza.
The Hamas government media office said two hospitals, a girls' school and ""dozens"" of homes were hit.
Hospitals in Gaza have been hit repeatedly since the war erupted, and the World Health Organization (WHO) says most of them are no longer functioning.
The Israeli military accuses Hamas militants of operating out of civilian facilities or from tunnels under them, a charge the Islamist group denies.AFPTV footage showed smoke billowing over Khan Yunis, southern Gaza's main city, as explosions could be heard from nearby Rafah, on the territory's southern border with Egypt.
The army said its forces had struck ""two terrorists loading weapons into a vehicle"" in Khan Yunis and raided ""a Hamas command centre"" there and seized weapons.
In central Israel, which has been largely spared the current violence, a suspected car ramming attack on Monday killed one woman and injured at least 12 other people, police said, announcing the arrest of two Palestinian men.
 
- 'Not enough for a human being' -
 
Hamas's October 7 attack that triggered the war resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
The militants also seized about 250 hostages, 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched a relentless military campaign that has killed at least 24,100 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.
The UN says more than three months of fighting have displaced roughly 85 percent of the territory's population, crowded into shelters and struggling to get food, water, fuel and medical care.
""My daughter can't sleep, she always tells me she's freezing,"" said Hanin Odwan, one of many displaced to makeshift camps in Rafah, where Palestinians huddled together around small fires to keep warm.
Echoing earlier warnings of a fast-approaching famine, UN agencies said in a joint statement that ""a fundamental step change in the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza is urgently needed"".
The WHO, World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF called for ""safer, faster"" supply routes to be opened, warning that the current levels of aid ""fall far short of what is needed to prevent a deadly combination of hunger, malnutrition and disease"".
The WFP said an aid convoy brought food to the territory's north on Thursday, the first such delivery since a one-week truce ended on December 1.
Cindy McCain, the WFP's director, said: ""People in Gaza risk dying of hunger just miles from trucks filled with food. Every hour puts countless lives at risk.""
On Sunday, thousands of Palestinians swamped two aid trucks delivering flour and tinned food to warehouses in Gaza City, an AFP correspondent said.
""We are only eating rice, but rice is not enough for a human being,"" said 53-year-old Omar al-Shandogi.Israel has faced international pressure over surging civilian casualties in Gaza, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under intense domestic pressure to account for political and security failings surrounding the October 7 attacks.
 
- 'Peace' efforts -
 
On the war's 100th day on Sunday, hundreds of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv for events urging action to rescue the remaining hostages.
""One hundred days and they are still abandoned there,"" said Amit Zach, a graphic designer.
Violence involving regional allies of Iran-backed Hamas -- considered a ""terrorist"" group by the United States and the European Union -- has surged since the war began.In Yemen, the US military said its fighter jets had shot down a cruise missile fired at an American destroyer in the Red Sea.
Attacks by Yemen's Huthi rebels, who say they act in solidarity with Gaza, have disrupted shipping in the vital maritime trade route, triggering strikes in recent days by US and British forces.
On the Israel-Lebanon border, Israeli forces and Hamas ally Hezbollah have traded near daily fire.
A missile strike on Sunday killed two Israeli civilians, medics said, and three militants who had crossed in from Lebanon died in a gun battle, according to the army.
International efforts to avoid escalation on Sunday saw China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi visiting Egypt, where he called for ""an international summit for peace"" and Palestinian statehood.Australia's top diplomat Penny Wong is due in the region this week to support ""diplomatic efforts towards a durable peace in the Middle East"", her office said.
In Turkey, a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, authorities have accused Israeli footballer Sagiv Jehezkel of ""incitement"" after he celebrated a goal with a message written on a wrist bandage, which read ""100 days. 07/10"" along with a Star of David.
A Turkish court on Monday released the player, who local media said was expected to return to Israel.
In a testimony to the police, reported by private news agency DHA, 28-year-old Jehezkel -- sacked by his Turkish team after Sunday's match -- said he ""believes that this 100-day period should end now. I want the war to end"".

Gaza refugee camp in ruins after Israeli strike,"GAZA - Residents of Gaza's Al-Maghazi refugee camp returned to their neighbourhood on Monday only to find blocks of concrete strewn where their homes had stood just a day ago.

""These houses are destroyed. Our house was bombed,"" said camp resident Abu Rami Abu al-Ais amid the debris.
""There's no safe place in the Gaza Strip.""
Late on Sunday three houses in the camp were hit by Israeli air strikes that killed at least 70 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. AFP was unable to independently verify the information.
Israel says it issues evacuation orders and warnings so civilians can get to safety before military activity, but Zeyad Awad said there was no advisory before the strike.
""What should we do? We are civilians, living peacefully and wanting only safety and security,"" he said.
""Yet we are suddenly struck by Israeli warplanes without any warning.""
The Israeli military said it was ""reviewing the incident"".
""Despite the challenges posed by Hamas terrorists operating within civilian areas in Gaza, the IDF (military) is committed to international law including taking feasible steps to minimise harm to civilians,"" it told AFP.
Swathes of the Gaza Strip have been razed in blistering Israeli bombardments during more than two months of war.The conflict was triggered by an unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October. They indiscriminately killed around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the latest official Israeli figures.
The militants also took hostage about 250 people, Israel says.
In response, Israel launched a relentless retaliatory land, sea and air assault on the Gaza Strip, alongside a ground invasion aimed at destroying Hamas.
The offensive has killed at least 20,670 people, most of them women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.
- 'They chased us' -
On Monday returning camp residents were shocked to see the scale of destruction, some describing how their children had panicked when the blast occurred.""My child said to me 'Protect me. What's happening? I can't breathe.'""
AFP footage showed several residents walking through the debris, inspecting the damage caused by the night-time strike. Some hugged each other and burst into tears.
Several charred vehicles could be seen scattered on the roads, while children searched through the wreckage to find their books.
Al-Maghazi camp is one of several in Gaza and was established in 1949, according to the UN, to shelter refugees who fled hostilities at the time of Israel's creation the year before.
Many who fled Al-Maghazi camp after the strikes on Sunday were doing so again, after already escaping attacks in northern Gaza.
One of them was Rawan Manasra, originally from Beit Hanun. The strike in the camp decimated her family, she said.
""They (Israeli army) killed my five brothers. I no longer have brothers. They killed them along with their children and wives,"" Manasra told AFP.
""Every day there are strikes... They tell us to move from the north to the south, then they chase us and attack us.""
Dozens of wounded from Sunday's strike were taken to Deir al-Balah hospital in central Gaza, one of the few hospitals still partly functioning. Some were on stretchers while volunteers carried others in their arms.""It's a massacre,"" health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said.
""Dozens of injured people are becoming martyrs due to the inability to treat them immediately,"" he added.
Israeli strikes in Gaza have repeatedly struck hospitals, which are protected under international humanitarian law, and desperation is growing among medical staff over their inability to treat people.
The Israeli military accuses Hamas of having tunnels under hospitals and using the medical facilities as command centres, a charge the Islamist group denies.",Monday 25 December 2023 - 19:47pm

Strikes on Gaza's Rafah as Biden calls Israel actions excessive,"JERUSALEM - Israel launched new air strikes Friday on the city of Rafah in Gaza's far south, after US President Joe Biden said its response to Hamas's October 7 attack has been ""over the top"".
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he has ordered Israeli forces to ""prepare to operate"" in Rafah, the last major city in the Gaza Strip that Israeli ground troops have yet to attack.
The United States is Israel's main international ally, providing it with billions of dollars in military aid.
The State Department said Thursday it did not support a ground offensive in Rafah, warning that, if not properly planned, such an operation in a city sheltering more than one million displaced Palestinians risked ""disaster"".And in a rare rebuke from its ally, Biden said Israel's military response to the October 7 attack had been excessive and should stop.
""I'm of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in Gaza, in the Gaza Strip, has been over the top,"" he told reporters at the White House.
""There are a lot of innocent people who are starving, a lot of innocent people who are in trouble and dying, and it's got to stop.""
Witnesses reported fresh strikes on Rafah overnight, after the Israeli military stepped up air raids on a city now overcrowded with about half of the Gaza Strip's 2.4 million people.
 
- 'Die in our homes' -
 
The Hamas-run territory's health ministry said more than 100 people were killed in the bombardment during the night, including at least eight in Rafah.The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said three children were killed in a strike on Rafah.
""We heard the sound of a huge explosion next to our house... we found two children martyred in the street,"" said Jaber al-Bardini, a 60-year-old in Rafah.
""There is no safe place in Rafah. If they storm Rafah we will die in our homes. We have no choice. We don't want to go anywhere else.""
The Israeli army said Friday that its forces had ""eliminated 15 terrorists"" in the past day in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza's biggest city not far from Rafah. It also reported fighting in central and northern Gaza.Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
In response, Israel vowed to eradicate Hamas and launched air strikes and a ground offensive that have killed at least 27,947 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
Militants seized 250 hostages, 132 of whom are still in Gaza, but 29 are presumed dead, Israel has said.
 
- 'Humanitarian nightmare' -
 
State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said Washington had ""yet to see any evidence of serious planning"" for an Israeli ground operation in Rafah.Noting the city on the border with Egypt was also a crucial entry point for humanitarian aid, he added such an assault was ""not something we'd support"".
""To conduct such an operation right now with no planning and little thought... would be a disaster,"" Patel said.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on his fifth crisis tour of the Middle East since the war erupted, had conveyed Washington's concerns to Netanyahu directly during talks this week in Jerusalem, he added.
UN chief Antonio Guterres said news of the coming Israeli push into Rafah was ""alarming"", and warned it ""would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare"".Israel's ""extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly, amounts to a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and a war crime"", he said.
 
- Ceasefire talks -
 
On the ceasefire talks, Blinken insisted he still saw ""space for agreement to be reached"" to halt the fighting and bring home Israeli hostages, even after Netanyahu rejected what he labelled Hamas's ""bizarre demands"".Egypt was set to host new talks with Qatari and Hamas negotiators in hopes of achieving ""calm"" in Gaza and a prisoner-hostage exchange, an Egyptian official said.
A Gaza-based Palestinian official close to the militant group later told AFP they expected negotiations to be ""difficult"", but said Hamas was ""keen to reach a ceasefire"".
The impact of the war has been felt widely, with violence involving Iran-backed allies of Hamas across the Middle East surging since October and drawing in US forces among others.Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement said Friday it had fired ""dozens of Katyusha rockets"" into northern Israel shortly before midnight (2100 GMT on Thursday) in response to Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon, including the city of Nabatiyeh.
It came after an Israeli drone strike on a car in Nabatiyeh seriously wounded a Hezbollah commander on Thursday, sources on both sides of the border said.
On the same day, the US military struck four unmanned surface vessels and seven mobile anti-ship cruise missiles that it said Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels had been set to launch against ships in the Red Sea.
The strike came after US forces last week launched a wave of attacks on Iran-linked targets in Iraq and Syria following the killing of three US troops in neighbouring Jordan.

"Hamas urges end to Gaza airdrops after deaths, more aid trucks","Hamas on Tuesday urged foreign nations to stop parachuting aid into war-torn Gaza after officials and humanitarians said 18 people died trying to reach food packages in the starving north.
Instead, the Palestinian militant group that rules the Gaza Strip demanded that its enemy Israel allow more aid trucks to enter the besieged territory, which the United Nations has warned is on the brink of a ""man-made famine"".
Fighting raged on unabated a day after the UN Security Council passed its first resolution calling for an ""immediate ceasefire"" in the bloodiest ever Gaza war, sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.
The resolution also demands that militants free the roughly 130 hostages Israel says remain in Gaza, including 33 captives who are presumed dead.
Jordanian, US and other planes have airdropped food into Gaza, even as UN officials and aid agencies have warned this falls far short of the dire needs of its 2.4 million people and is far less effective than ensuring overland access.On Tuesday, as Jordanian, Egyptian, Emirati and German planes again airdropped relief goods, with the sight of food packages floating down on parachutes sending Palestinian crowds rushing toward them. 
Six people were killed in stampedes and 12 others drowned off the territory's Mediterranean coast, the Hamas government and the Swiss-based Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor said.
Hamas in a statement called for ""an immediate end to airdrop operations"" and ""the immediate and rapid opening of land crossings to allow humanitarian aid to reach our Palestinian people"".The UN children's fund, UNICEF, said vastly more aid must be rushed into Gaza by road, rather than air or sea, to avert ""this imminent famine"".
Food aid is usually only airdropped in crises where ""people are cut off for hundreds of kilometres"", said UNICEF spokesman James Elder, speaking via video link from Gaza.
But ""the lifesaving aid they need is a matter of kilometres away"", he said, as trucks loaded with aid have been waiting across Gaza's southern border with Egypt.
""We need to use the road networks.""
 
- UN ceasefire vote -
Israeli troops meanwhile battled Hamas with no sign of a let-up in the war raging for almost six months.
The Israeli military said its jets had struck more than 60 targets, including tunnels and buildings ""in which armed terrorists were identified"".The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said 70 people were killed early Tuesday, 13 of them in air strikes around the southern city of Rafah.
The Security Council resolution passed Monday demanded a ceasefire for the ongoing Muslim holy month of Ramadan that should lead to a ""lasting"" truce.
Israel's top ally the United States, which had blocked previous resolutions, abstained amid growing concern for the worsening humanitarian situation, sparking an angry reaction from Israel.
Washington has baulked at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's determination to launch an assault on Rafah.The far southern city is Gaza's last major population centre still untouched by Israeli ground troops, and where most of Gaza's population has sought refuge.
Israel charged that the UN resolution ""hurts"" both its war effort and attempts to free hostages, though the White House insisted there had been no shift in its policy.
Palestinians in Rafah welcomed the UN vote and called on Washington to ensure the resolution is implemented.
Bilal Awad, 63, said the United States must ""stand against an attack on Rafah, and support the return of the displaced to their cities"" further north in Gaza. 
 
- 'Political isolation' -
The October 7 attack resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 32,414 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry.
Hamas welcomed the UN resolution and reaffirmed its readiness to negotiate the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, during a visit to Iran on Tuesday, said Israel is experiencing ""unprecedented political isolation"" and losing US ""protection"" at the Security Council.
In an earlier statement, Hamas had blamed Israel for the failure to make progress in the latest round of talks hosted by mediator Qatar.Hamas argued Netanyahu and his cabinet were ""entirely responsible for the failure of negotiation efforts and for preventing an agreement from being reached up until now"".
Netanyahu's office hit back on social media platform X, charging that Hamas was ""not interested in continuing negotiations"".
Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said on Tuesday the talks were ""ongoing"", adding there had been no ""development that would lead to thinking that one of the teams has pulled out of the negotiations"".
 
- Battles near hospitals -On the ground in Gaza, dozens of Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles surrounded the Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis, where thousands of displaced people have sought refuge, witnesses said.
The health ministry said shots were being fired around the sprawling complex, but no raid had yet taken place.
At Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital, the territory's largest, Israeli troops have been engaged in heavy fighting for nine days. Israel claims to have killed 170 Palestinian militants and arrested hundreds.
On Monday, the Israeli military reported killing about 20 fighters around Al-Amal Hospital, also in Khan Yunis, over the previous day in close-quarters combat and air strikes.Palestinians living near Al-Shifa have reported corpses in the streets, constant bombardment and the rounding up of men who are stripped to their underwear and questioned.",Tuesday 26 March 2024 - 21:00pm
"Israel, Hamas agree four-day truce, 50 hostages to be released","GAZA - Israel and Hamas announced a deal on Wednesday allowing at least 50 hostages and scores of Palestinian prisoners to be freed, while offering besieged Gaza residents a four-day truce after weeks of all-out war.
In the first major diplomatic breakthrough in the war, Israel, Hamas, the United States and Qatar sketched in a series of statements a carefully sequenced agreement that has been weeks in the making.
Under the Qatar-brokered deal, Palestinian militants will release 50 women and children kidnapped during their October 7 raids, in which Israel says 1,200 people were killed, most of them civilians.
A senior US official said three Americans, including three-year-old Abigail Mor Idan, were among the 50 earmarked for staggered release from Thursday.
Qatar's foreign ministry confirmed the deal, saying that ""a number of Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons"" would be released in exchange for the hostages.
""The starting time of the pause will be announced within the next 24 hours and last for four days, subject to extension,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups are believed to be holding an estimated 240 Israelis and foreigners hostage in Gaza.
Israel said that to facilitate the hostage release it would initiate a four-day ""pause"" in its six-week-old air, land and sea assault of Gaza, but stressed this did not spell the end of the war.
For every 10 additional hostages released, there would be an extra day's ""pause"", the Israeli government said.
Hamas released a statement welcoming the ""humanitarian truce"" and said it would also see 150 Palestinians released from Israeli jails.
""The resistance is committed to the truce as long as the occupation honours it,"" a Hamas official told AFP.
Sources from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another militant group that took part in the October 7 attacks, had earlier told AFP the truce would include a ceasefire on the ground and a pause in Israeli air operations over southern Gaza.
Israel launched Operation ""Swords of Iron"" in Gaza in retaliation for the worst attacks in its history, vowing to secure the release of the hostages and to destroy Hamas.
According to the Hamas government in Gaza, the war has killed 14,100 people, thousands of them children.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet approved the accord Wednesday after a near-all-night meeting, in which he told reticent ministers this was a ""difficult decision but it's a right decision.""
The cabinet's sign-off was one of the last stumbling blocks after what one US official described as five ""extremely excruciating"" weeks of talks involving the US Central Intelligence Agency, Israel's overseas spy agency Mossad, Egyptian intelligence, and leaders in Doha, Cairo, Washington, Gaza and Israel.
 
- Misgivings -
 
Ahead of the cabinet vote, Netanyahu had faced a revolt from within his right-wing coalition, some of whom believe it gave too much to the Palestinian militants they have vowed to crush.
Hardline Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir signalled he would vote against the agreement, saying it should include the release of Israeli soldiers also taken by Hamas.
But with dozens of families in Israel who are beyond desperate to have their loved ones returned home, and the Israeli public gripped by the hostages' fate, the government ultimately set aside any misgivings.
Israel's hawkish Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said before the crunch meeting that he had won assurances that the deal would not spell the end of the war to destroy Hamas.
""Immediately after we have exhausted this phase"" he said, security operations would ""continue in full force.""
In a statement, the Israeli government underscored that the truce agreement would not mean the end of the war in Gaza.
Israel ""will continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza,"" a government statement said.
 
- 'Unbearable situation' -
 
Earlier, Gaza resident Hamza Abdel Razeq said he would welcome any ceasefire agreement, hoping it would bring some respite for people who have endured Israel's bombing and expanding ground offensive.
""The people are really suffering,"" he told AFP. ""I believe it will pave the way for longer truces or even a total ceasefire.""
A US official said there was also hope that the deal would lead to a ""full pause"" in fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border between Israel and Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran.
Since the Israel-Hamas war began, the border has seen escalating exchanges of fire, killing scores on both sides.
Another Gaza resident, Mahmud Abu Najm, said: ""We... pray to God for its success because the people are enduring an unbearable situation.""
Large parts of Gaza have been flattened by thousands of air strikes, and the territory is under siege, with minimal food, water and fuel allowed in.
Six weeks into the war, Israel has come under intense international pressure to implement a humanitarian ceasefire.
But in recent days it has pressed its offensive into northern Gaza.
The Israeli military said air strikes had hit ""around 250"" Hamas targets in the past day, destroying three underground shafts in the Jabalia area, which it said it had fully surrounded.
At Jabalia's Indonesian Hospital, the Hamas-run health ministry said strikes had killed dozens, but there was no independent confirmation of the toll.
The Israeli army said later its troops had ""directly targeted"" the source of fire from within the Indonesian Hospital.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said three doctors, including two it employed, were killed in an Israeli strike on the Al-Awda hospital in Jabalia refugee camp.
Israel says Hamas uses medical facilities to hide fighters and as bases for operations, making them legitimate military objectives while insisting it does everything possible to limit harm to civilians.

Israel bombs Gaza after warning Hamas nears 'dissolution',"JERUSALEM - Israel pressed on with its bombing of Gaza on Tuesday after saying its campaign to destroy Hamas has left the Palestinian militant group on the ""the verge of dissolution"".
Humanitarian leaders fear the besieged territory will soon be overwhelmed by disease and starvation, and are piling diplomatic pressure on Israel to boost efforts to protect civilians.
Fierce fighting raged on Tuesday, with Hamas saying clashes had taken place in central Gaza and witnesses reporting deadly Israeli strikes in the south of the territory.
Strikes on Monday targeted Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis, now the epicentre of the fighting, as well as Rafah, a city on the border with Egypt where tens of thousands of people are seeking shelter.
""Hamas is on the verge of dissolution -- the IDF is taking over its last strongholds,"" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said late Monday.
The war began with Hamas's October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures, and saw around 240 hostages taken back to Gaza.Israel has responded with a military offensive that has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed at least 18,200 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Israel's army chief Herzi Halevi visited the centre of Khan Yunis on Monday, where he said his forces were ""securing our accomplishments in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, the entrance in the southern part of the Strip, and also deep down into the ground"".
The UN estimates 1.9 million of the territory's 2.4 million people have been displaced by the war, half of them children.
Fighting and heavy bombardment in the south, where Israel had previously urged civilians to seek safety, have left people with few places to go.
Umm Mohammed al-Jabri lost seven children in an air strike on Rafah after fleeing there from Gaza City further north.
""I have four children left,"" said Jabri, 56. ""Last night they bombed the house we were in and destroyed it. They said Rafah would be a safe place. There is no safe place.""
 
- Basic supplies run out -
 
Civilians in Gaza are facing a catastrophic situation, the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said Monday, comparing the territory's destruction to that of Germany during World War II.Health services have been devastated, with only 14 of Gaza's 36 hospitals functioning at any capacity, according to UN humanitarian agency OCHA.
In central Gaza, Al-Aqsa hospital was inundated with victims Monday, including dozens of screaming children, after Israeli strikes on the Al-Maghazi refugee camp.
As basic supplies run out and sanitary conditions deteriorate, women and girls in Rafah said they had been forced to use scraps of cloth for menstrual periods.
""I cut up my kid's clothes or any piece of cloth I find,"" said 25-year-old Hala Ataya.
In Gaza City's Al-Rimal neighbourhood, thousands of Palestinians set up camp at a UN agency headquarters after nearby homes and shops were destroyed by Israeli strikes.
An AFP correspondent said both the Islamic and adjacent Al-Azhar universities had been reduced to rubble, as had the police station.
""There is no water. There is no electricity, no bread, no milk for the children, and no diapers,"" said Rami al-Dahduh, 23, a tailor.International aid organisations have struggled to get supplies to desperate Gazans under Israeli bombardment, with only the Rafah crossing in Egypt open.
Facing growing pressure to do more for civilians, Israel announced Monday it would be screening aid to Gaza at two additional checkpoints, which would allow more assistance to enter the ravaged territory.
No new direct crossings will be opened, Israel said, but the Nitzana and Kerem Shalom crossings will be used to carry out checks before sending the trucks through Rafah.
 
- UN vote -
 
The UN General Assembly is due to vote Tuesday on a non-binding resolution demanding ""an immediate humanitarian ceasefire"" in Gaza -- a call that the Security Council has so far failed to make.The United States, one of only five permanent members of the Security Council, used its veto on Friday to halt a draft text calling for a ceasefire.
In a bid to build pressure, Arab countries called for the new special session of the General Assembly following a visit to the Rafah border by more than a dozen Security Council ambassadors.
The draft text, seen by AFP, largely reproduces the resolution blocked in the Council on Friday by the United States.
Fears of a wider conflict continue to grow, with Iran-backed groups targeting US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria, and daily exchanges of fire along Israel's border with Lebanon.
A drone and rockets targeted two military bases in Iraq and Syria on Monday housing forces of the international coalition against the Islamic State group, a US military official said.Israeli bombardment killed an official in south Lebanon, the National News Agency said, amid near-daily cross-border exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah.
Israel has observed ""heightened aggression and increased attacks by Iranian-backed Hezbolllah"", war cabinet member Benny Gantz said Monday, vowing ""to remove such threat from the civilian population of northern Israel"".
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Lebanon, a general strike in solidarity with Gaza saw shops, schools and government offices closed on Monday.

No let-up in Gaza war despite UN ceasefire resolution,"GAZA CITY - Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, with no sign of a let-up in the war despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an ""immediate ceasefire"".
The resolution was adopted on Monday after Israel's closest ally the United States abstained.
It demands an ""immediate ceasefire"" for the ongoing Muslim holy month of Ramadan, leading to a ""lasting"" truce.
It also demands that Hamas and other militants free hostages they took during the unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel, though it does not directly link the release to a truce.
After the vote, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres led calls for the resolution to be implemented.
""Failure would be unforgivable,"" he wrote on social media platform X.
Israel reacted furiously to the US abstention, as it allowed the resolution to go through with all the other 14 Security Council members voting yes.
The resolution is the first since the Gaza war erupted to demand an immediate halt in the fighting.
Washington insisted that its abstention, which followed numerous vetoes, did not mark a shift in policy, although it has taken an increasingly tougher line with Israel in recent weeks.
The war began with Hamas's October 7 attacks, which resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages, of whom Israel believes around 130 are still held in Gaza, including 33 presumed dead.
Vowing to destroy Hamas and free the captives, Israel has carried out a relentless bombardment and ground invasion of the coastal territory.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip on Monday put the Palestinian death toll at 32,333, most of them women and children.
Hamas welcomed the Security Council resolution and reaffirmed its readiness to negotiate the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.",Tuesday 26 March 2024 - 06:00am
"Hamas says Israel bombs Gaza aid crossing, as UN plans vote","GAZA - Israel bombed a newly reopened aid crossing point on Thursday, Hamas authorities said, hours before the United Nations Security Council was to make another attempt to pass a much-delayed resolution on pausing the Gaza fighting.
Separate diplomatic efforts continued for a fresh truce and hostage release deal in the worst-ever Gaza war.
The United Nations human rights office in Ramallah said it had received reports that Israeli troops had ""summarily killed"" at least 11 unarmed Palestinian men in Gaza City's Rimal neighbourhood this week.
An Israeli official rejected the allegations as ""nothing but blood libel"" and ""yet another example of the partisan and prejudiced approach against Israel"" by the UN body.Israel has been under increasing pressure from allies, including the United States which provides it with billions of dollars in military aid, to protect civilians.
The UN estimates 1.9 million Gazans are displaced, out of a population of 2.4 million.
With their homes destroyed, they are living in crowded shelters and struggling to find food, fuel, water and medical supplies. Diseases are spreading, and communications have been repeatedly cut.
 
- 'Shameful milestone' -
 
On Wednesday Gaza's Hamas government said the death toll in the Palestinian territory had hit 20,000, mostly women and children, which United Nations humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths called a ""tragic and shameful milestone"".
The war began on October 7 with an unprecedented attack by Hamas militants. They broke through Gaza's militarised border to kill around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
They also abducted about 250 people.
According to the UN, the number of aid trucks entering Gaza is well below the daily pre-war average.After weeks of pressure, Israel approved the temporary reopening of the Kerem Shalom crossing on Friday to enable aid deliveries directly to Gaza, rather than through the Rafah crossing from Egypt.
On Thursday an Israeli strike killed Bassem Ghaben, the head of the Palestinian side of Kerem Shalom, the crossings authority and the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory said.
Three other people were also killed when Israeli aircraft targeted the infrastructure, they said.
Israeli officials did not immediately respond to requests from AFP for comment. 
The army said its aircraft struck 230 targets in Gaza over the past day, including a rocket launch site, while ground forces had found weapons inside a school near Gaza City.Late Wednesday the UN said Israel had ordered the evacuation of large areas of Khan Yunis, the main city in southern Gaza.
Incoming rocket fire set off air raid sirens across southern Israel and as far north as Tel Aviv, but there were no reported casualties.
Hamas's military wing announced it had launched the Tel Aviv-bound ""missile barrage in response to the Israeli massacres against civilians"".
 
- 'Beyond catastrophic' -
 
The UN rights office said the incident in Rimal ""raises alarm about the possible commission of a war crime"", and added the men were killed in front of their family members.""The details and circumstances of the killings are still under verification,"" the UN said.
Legal experts have previously told AFP that both sides could be accused of committing war crimes.
There are no longer any functional hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday, after it led missions to two badly damaged hospitals, Al-Shifa and Al-Ahli.
""Our staff are running out of words to describe the beyond catastrophic situation facing remaining patients and health workers,"" said Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO Gaza and West Bank representative.Diplomats called for more assistance to reach the territory.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, speaking on a visit to Egypt, said: ""Everything that can be done must be done to get aid into Gaza, to help people in the desperate situation that they're in.""
French President Emmanuel Macron was in Jordan on Thursday to discuss with King Abdullah II ""joint work on humanitarian and medical aid for the civilian population of Gaza"", according to the French presidency.
France called for the protection of civilians and ""a truce leading to a humanitarian ceasefire"", Macron said on Wednesday.
 
- Controversial wording -
 
The UN Security Council was due to try for a fourth day Thursday to pass a resolution calling for a halt in fighting.Israel has rejected the term ""ceasefire"", and Washington has used its veto twice to thwart resolutions opposed by Israel since the start of the war.
The United Arab Emirates is sponsoring a proposed resolution which has already been watered down to secure compromise, according to a draft version seen by AFP.
It calls for ""the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities"".
Hopes that Israel and Hamas could be inching towards another truce and deal to free the remaining 129 hostages had risen this week as the head of the Palestinian militant group visited Egypt and talks took place in Europe. However, the stated positions of Israel and Hamas remain far apart.
The Palestinian group's military wing said on Thursday that Israel's objective to eliminate it was ""doomed to fail"" and that any further releases of hostages depended on a ""cessation of hostilities"".
US President Joe Biden said of a fresh hostage release deal: ""There's no expectation at this point. But we are pushing it.""
Qatar, backed by Egypt and the United States, last month helped broker a first week-long truce that saw 105 hostages released, including 80 Israelis freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
Displaced Gazans are pleading for a ceasefire.""My message is to put an end to this humiliation,"" said Fuad Ibrahim Wadi, who found refuge at a greenhouse in Rafah. ""This war does nothing but destroy. Enough is enough.""
The war has sparked fears of wider conflict.
There have been regular exchanges of fire over the Lebanon border, and missiles from Iran-backed Yemeni rebels have disrupted Red Sea shipping.
Israeli strikes killed a woman in a south Lebanon village on Thursday, Lebanese media and rescuers said, with retaliatory attacks by Hezbollah militants wounding two civilians, according to Israel's military.

Israel-Hamas battles rage around major Gaza hospitals,"Israeli forces fought Hamas militants in besieged Gaza on Monday including around at least two major hospitals, raising fears for the patients, medics and displaced people trapped inside.
Troops and tanks have encircled Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital, the territory's biggest, for a week and more recently moved on the Al-Amal Hospital in the main southern city of Khan Yunis.
While Israel has labelled its operations ""precise"" and said it has taken care to avoid harm to civilians, aid agencies have voiced alarm about civilians caught up in the fighting.
As combat raged on, technical talks have continued in Qatar towards a truce and hostage release deal, and the UN Security Council was set to convene later in the day for a vote on a new ceasefire demand.
Almost six months into the war sparked by the October 7 attack, global concern has mounted over the threat of famine in Gaza, and on Israeli plans to invade the crowded far-southern city of Rafah.UN chief Antonio Guterres, on a crisis visit to the Middle East, has pleaded for an end to the ""non-stop nightmare"" for the 2.4 million people trapped in Gaza's worst-ever war.
As Israel's top ally the United States has also voiced rising concern, the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, was headed to Washington for talks with Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin.
Gallant said his focus in the United States -- which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid a year -- would include ""our ability to obtain platforms and munitions"".
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads a coalition including ultra-nationalist parties, has vowed to go ahead with a Rafah invasion even without Washington's support.
US Vice President Kamala Harris stressed on ABC TV that a Rafah invasion would be ""a huge mistake"" and, when asked whether she would rule out ""consequences"" for Israel, replied that ""I am ruling out nothing"".
 
- 'We are suffering' -
The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's unprecedented attack of October 7 which resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.Israel has vowed to destroy the militants, who also seized about 250 hostages, of whom Israel believes around 130 remain in Gaza, including 33 presumed dead.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip on Sunday put the total Palestinian death toll at 32,333, most of them women and children.
Bombardment and fighting in Gaza killed another 72 people overnight, according to the ministry.
More than 50 airstrikes rained down on the Gaza Strip, said the Hamas government press office.
Israel's armed forces gave a similar number and said its fighter jets and helicopters had struck about 50 ""terror targets"" and ""eliminated approximately 10 terrorists"".Food and water shortages have deepened the suffering, especially in northern Gaza where residents, mostly women and children, were waiting in line to fill up jerrycans and buckets in Jabalia.
""We don't even have food to give us the energy to go to collect the water -- let alone the innocent children, women and the elderly,"" said one man, Bassam Mohammed al-Haou.
Another local man, Falah Saed, said ""we are suffering a lot from water shortages because all and pipes and pumps have stopped working since the beginning of the war"".
 
- Hospital battles -
Israel's army said it was battling militants around two hospitals and reported some 20 enemy fighters killed in the past day in close-quarters combat and air strikes.
Israel labelled the raids ""precise operational activities"".Palestinians living near Al-Shifa have reported hellish conditions, including corpses in the streets, constant bombardment and the rounding up of men, who are stripped to their underwear and questioned.
The Al-Shifa raid was in its eighth day and the military reported detaining some ""500 terrorists affiliated with the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist organisations"" and locating weapons in the area.
Israel has said the operation will continue until the last militant is ""in their hands"", signalling an extended presence at Al-Shifa, which troops also raided in November.
At Al-Amal Hospital, the Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli forces had surrounded all entrances and prohibited hospital staff from leaving.The military said its Al-Amal operation included ""raids on several terrorist infrastructure sites in the area and located explosive devices, RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades) and military equipment"".
The Red Crescent on Sunday said military vehicles had also surrounded the nearby Nasser hospital, but the situation there remained unclear.
 
- UN vote on truce call -
Later in the day in New York, the UN Security Council was to vote on a new draft resolution calling for an ""immediate"" ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages.
Russia and China had vetoed an earlier text proposed by the United States, but Beijing said Monday it would back the latest version.
Permanent Council member the United States has unequivocally supported Israel's right to defend itself but recently tempered its support for Israel over its conduct of the war.
The new text, according to the version seen by AFP on Sunday, ""demands an immediate ceasefire"" during the ongoing Muslim holy month of Ramadan, ""leading to a permanent sustainable ceasefire"".It also ""demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages"" as well as the ""lifting of all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale"".
The text is being put forward by non-permanent members of the Security Council, who have worked with Washington to avoid a veto, according to diplomats speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity.
One diplomat told AFP that ""we expect, barring a last-minute twist, that the resolution will be adopted and that the United States will not vote against it"". ",Monday 25 March 2024 - 16:10pm
Deadly Israel strikes rock Gaza after truce collapses,"GAZA - Israel resumed its deadly bombardment of Gaza on Friday despite international calls for a renewed truce, killing at least 178 people according to Hamas authorities as five hostages held by the militant group were also confimed dead.
Clouds of grey smoke from strikes shot up on the Gaza skyline and rockets fired from the territory streaked into Israel as Israel resumed its offensive, sparked by the deadly Hamas attacks and kidnappings on October 7.
The health ministry in Gaza run by the Palestinian militant group said at least 178 people had been killed there since the pause in hostilities expired early Friday.
UN agencies warned of a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza as hospitals again struggled to cope with the wounded after a week-long respite.Israel alleged that Hamas attempted to break the truce before it ended at 0500 GMT by firing a rocket, and that it failed to produce a list of further hostages for release on Friday after seven earlier exchanges.
As hostilities resumed, Hamas's armed wing received ""the order to resume combat"" and to ""defend the Gaza Strip"", according to a source close to the group who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media.
United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and the White House called for the break in fighting to be restored.
""We continue to work with Israel, Egypt and Qatar on efforts to extend the humanitarian pause in Gaza,"" a US National Security Council spokesperson said.
 
- 'Mother of all thumpings' -
 
Seven days of hostage-prisoner exchanges had yielded tearful reunions of Israeli families with their released relatives and jubilation in the streets of the occupied West Bank as Palestinian prisoners walked free from Israeli jails.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Dubai that the United States remained ""intensely focused on getting everyone home, getting hostages back"" and ""pursuing the process that had worked for seven days"" during the truce.
But Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told reporters: ""Having chosen to hold onto our women, Hamas will now take the mother of all thumpings.""
The Israeli military said ""ground, air and naval forces struck terror targets in the north and south of the Gaza Strip, including in Khan Yunis and Rafah.""Outside the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, a man in a blue sweater bellowed in grief and turned his face and hands to the sky after viewing a dead boy in a body bag, AFPTV footage showed.
""What did he do wrong? God, what did we do to deserve this?"" he yelled.
 
- 'Horror movie' -
 
During the unprecedented October 7 attack, Hamas fighters broke through Gaza's militarised border into Israel, killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped around 240, according to Israeli authorities.
In response, Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas and unleashed an air and ground campaign that the Hamas authorities who run Gaza say has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians.Guterres has warned of a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" in Gaza, where the United Nations says 1.7 million people are displaced and short of food, water and other essentials.
""The healthcare service is on its knees,"" Rob Holden, a World Health Organization (WHO) senior emergency officer, told journalists in Geneva on a video-link from Gaza as explosions were heard in the background.
""It is like a horror movie.""
On a bed at Khan Yunis's Nasser hospital, Amal Abu Dagga wept, her beige veil covered in blood.
""I don't even know what happened to my children,"" she said. A relative, Jamil Abu Dagga, told AFP the family had been at home when the bombs started falling.
In Israel, sirens warning of potential missiles sounded in several communities near Gaza, and authorities said they were restarting security measures in the area, including closing schools.
A rocket strike destroyed a van in one Israeli community near Gaza.
 
- 'Evacuation zones' -
 
Mediation efforts by Qatar and Egypt were ""ongoing"", said a source briefed on the talks who asked not to be named.
During the seven-day truce, Hamas freed 80 Israeli hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners, and more aid entered Gaza.
Twenty-five other hostages, mostly Thais, were also freed in separate arrangements.On Thursday Blinken, meeting Israeli and Palestinian officials, called for the truce to be extended, and warned any resumption of combat must protect Palestinian civilians.
The Israeli military published a map of ""evacuation zones"" in the Gaza Strip that it said would enable residents to ""evacuate from specific places for their safety if required"".
Residents in various areas of Gaza were sent SMS warnings on Friday.
Israeli forces ""will begin a crushing military attack on your area of residence with the aim of eliminating the terrorist organisation Hamas,"" the warnings said.
""Stay away from all military activity of every kind.""
 
- Children held hostage -
 
On Thursday, eight Israeli hostages, some holding dual nationality, were released in the seventh round of exchanges under the truce.The country's prison service later said another 30 Palestinian prisoners -- 23 minors and seven women -- had been freed.
The Israel army confirmed on Friday that five of the hostages seized by Hamas in the attacks had died. It said the Islamist group was still holding ""136 hostages, among them 17 women and children"".
Hamas said it had offered to hand over the bodies of a mother and her two sons -- one of them a baby -- in talks to extend the now-expired truce.
Israeli officials refused to comment on what they called Hamas ""propaganda"".
Shiri Bibas, her 10-month-old son Kfir and his four-year-old brother Ariel, along with their father Yarden, have become emblematic of the October 7 attacks.Hezbollah meanwhile claimed its first attacks on Israel since the truce ended.

Second ship with aid bound for Gaza leaves Cyprus port,"A second vessel carrying aid to war-torn Gaza set sail from Cyprus on Saturday, an AFP correspondent said, more than two weeks after the last shipment arrived by sea.
Almost 400 tons of aid is being carried to Gaza on a flotilla organised by two charities -- the US-based World Central Kitchen and the Spanish Open Arms.
The barge and two salvage vessels left the port of Larnaca following diplomacy by Cyprus to try to open a maritime corridor to the territory, under siege by Israeli forces since last October.
The flotilla will take around 65 hours to reach Gaza, according to the state-funded Cyprus News Agency.
World Central Kitchen said the shipment contains items like rice, pasta, flour, legumes, canned vegetables and proteins.
The United Arab Emirates provided a special cargo of dates, which are traditionally eaten to break the daily fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the charity said.
A makeshift dock has been constructed for unloading humanitarian aid in Gaza.",Saturday 30 March 2024 - 17:10pm
International aid backlog as Gaza supplies held up in Egypt,"CAIRO - Under the roar of military aircraft, workers were rushing to offload supplies at Egypt's El Arish airport as aid trickles into the stricken Gaza Strip after more than two weeks of war with Israel.
Planeloads of aid have been landing for days at El Arish, about 45 kilometres from the Rafah border crossing, the only route into Gaza after all Israeli checkpoints were closed following a shock Hamas assault on October 7.
But it was only over the weekend that the first supplies were allowed to reach Gaza.
Hamas militants stormed into Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7 and killed at least 1,400 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli officials.
More than 4,650 Palestinians, mainly civilians, have been killed across the Gaza Strip in relentless Israeli bombardments in retaliation for the attacks, according to the latest toll from the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza.
Three convoys of aid totalling about 50 trucks have cleared the Rafah crossing since Saturday, reaching a populace in dire need of food, water and medical supplies.
The United Nations estimates Gaza requires about 100 trucks a day to meet the needs of residents, almost half of whom are believed to have been displaced by Israel's bombing campaign.
In less than an hour on Sunday, two Qatari planes and one Indian aircraft, all carrying aid, touched down at El Arish, with scores of Egyptian Red Crescent workers scrambling to unload them.
UN aid chief Martin Griffiths has called the deliveries into Gaza a ""small glimmer of hope"" but warned its people would ""need more, much more"".
The United States has vowed a continued flow of aid under a deal brokered by President Joe Biden with Egyptian and Israeli leaders.

Alarm as Israel raids Gaza hospital,"GAZA - Israeli soldiers on Wednesday raided and then combed through Gaza's main hospital, a key objective in their war on Hamas but which has raised fears for thousands of patients and other civilians trapped inside. 
READ: Gaza hospitals out of fuel, caught in Israel-Hamas fighting
Both Israel and its top ally the United States say the Palestinian militants have a command centre below the Al-Shifa complex, a charge denied by Hamas and leaders of the hospital that has become a focal point in the 40-day-old war.
Israeli soldiers, some wearing face masks and shooting in the air, ordered young men to surrender, a journalist in contact with AFP reported, as the army said it conducted a ""precise and targeted"" operation at the facility.
About 1,000 male Palestinians, their hands above their heads, were in the vast hospital courtyard, some of them stripped naked by Israeli soldiers checking them for weapons or explosives, the journalist said.The Israeli army described it as ""a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area"" of the facility as Washington, the Red Cross and World Health Organization urged utmost caution with civilian lives.
Israel said the raid was being executed based on ""an operational necessity"" while the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority branded it a ""flagrant"" violation of international law.
The United Nations has said it estimates that at least 2,300 people -- patients, staff and displaced civilians -- are inside and may be unable to escape because of fierce fighting.
Witnesses have described conditions inside the hospital as horrific, with medical procedures taking place without anaesthetic, families with scant food or water living in corridors and the stench of decomposing corpses filling the air.The army said it had delivered incubators, baby food and medical supplies to the hospital during the operation. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to its attacks on October 7, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 240 hostages taken to Gaza.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says Israel's ensuing aerial bombardment and ground offensive have killed 11,320 people, mostly civilians, including thousands of children.
 
- Fear for civilians -
 
International concern over the fate of the people inside the hospital has been steadily increasing, especially as the civilian toll in Gaza has climbed during the war.
""The protection of newborns, patients, medical staff and all civilians must override all other concerns,"" UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said on X, formerly Twitter. ""Hospitals are not battlegrounds.""The White House reiterated its concerns for the safety of civilians shortly after the raid began.
""We do not support striking a hospital from the air and we don't want to see a firefight in a hospital,"" a National Security Council spokesperson said.
Earlier, the White House had said that US intelligence sources corroborated Israel's claim that Hamas and another Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad, had buried an operational ""command and control node"" under Al-Shifa.
Citing the Hamas-run health ministry, UN humanitarian agency OCHA said 40 patients had died in Al-Shifa on Tuesday, while hospital director Abu Salmiya said 179 bodies had been interred in a mass grave inside the complex.
 
- 'We could see flames' -
 
The situation in Gaza's other hospitals is also dire, with the World Health Organization saying 22 of 36 are not functional due to a lack of generator fuel, damage or combat.
Patients, the wounded, their families, and the medical teams trapped in Al-Quds hospital were evacuated Tuesday, said the Palestinian Red Crescent, adding the facility had been under ""siege"" for 10 days.
The head of the UN children's agency described Wednesday the ""devastating"" scenes she witnessed during a visit to Gaza, urging the parties to the conflict to ""stop this horror"".The humanitarian crisis also includes 1.5 million people who, according to the UN, have fled southwards after Israel told them to leave the northern half of the territory.
Even though Gazans have been urged to flee south, strikes there have steadily claimed lives and destroyed homes.
""All of a sudden, all we could see was flames. We were all buried under the rubble, no one could see anyone else,"" said Ali Abu Jazar, who survived a strike in Rafah, in the far south of Gaza.
""We started yelling to let them know 'we're here, underneath you,' so they began clearing the rubble to rescue us,"" he added.
A trickle of aid has made it into the besieged territory in the five weeks of war, and crucially fuel for generators has been in short supply.
Just hours after receiving its first delivery of fuel since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, the UN warned Wednesday its operations in Gaza were on the brink of collapse.
The UN agency for supporting Palestinian refugees confirmed receiving 23,027 litres of fuel, but said it met only ""nine percent"" of the daily needs.
 
- Hostage talks -
 
Israeli leaders have so far rejected calls for a ceasefire in the five-week-old war until hostages are released. 
Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's military wing, said Monday that Israel had asked for the release of 100 hostages, while the militants want 200 Palestinian children and 75 women freed from Israeli prisons.With pressure building on the Israeli government, Netanyahu said he was ""working relentlessly"" to get the hostages out.
Relatives of the captives set out Tuesday on a protest march from Tel Aviv to the prime minister's office in Jerusalem to call for their release, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.
The group later demanded the government ""approve a deal tonight to bring home all hostages from Gaza"".

Gaza war sparks Arab fears of new Palestinian displacement,"GAZA CITY - The sight of tent cities for Palestinians displaced within war-torn Gaza evokes dark historical memories for Israel's Arab neighbours, especially Egypt and Jordan.
""That's how the Nakba started,"" says the Gaza-based rights group Al Mezan, reflecting regional suspicions that Israel is planning to empty the coastal territory.
The Nakba, or ""catastrophe"", is how the Arab world refers to the exodus or forced displacement of 760,000 Palestinians in the war that led to the creation of Israel 75 years ago.
The fear of history repeating itself has been stoked as Israel has waged war on Hamas since the Islamist group killed 1,400 people in the October 7 attack on southern Israel.
The Gaza Strip is mostly populated by Palestinian refugees and their descendants, who have now endured over two weeks of withering bombardment that the health ministry says has killed over 5,000 people. 
So Israeli warnings to evacuate the north of the territory ahead of a looming ground invasion have raised deeper historical fears, with one million Gazans already forced out of their homes.
The only possible way out of Gaza that is not controlled by Israel is the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.
Egypt has allowed aid convoys into Gaza through Rafah after Israel stopped bombing the Palestinian side under a US-brokered deal -- but there has been no mass flight of refugees heading the other way.
Egypt fears that throwing open the gates could facilitate Israeli plans for a forced mass eviction of Palestinians, many of whom are now homeless, sleeping in the open or sheltered in UN tents.
The Gaza-based Al Mezan Center for Human Rights said: ""When we see the tents at the border today, it should give the chills to anyone who know Palestinian history -- the tents, that's how the Nakba started.
""Most of the people would rather die in Gaza than being made a refugee again.""
- Security implications -
Israel has stressed its eviction order for northern Gaza aims to get Palestinian civilians out of harm's way as it goes after Hamas and hopes to rescue more than 220 hostages.
But the suspicion Israel is planning a mass eviction has been reinforced by former Israeli officials who have suggested in TV interviews that Egypt could build vast tent cities in its Sinai desert, with international funding.
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has stressed that Israel as an occupying force has responsibility for Palestinian civilians under international law.
""If the idea is forced displacement, there is the Negev,"" he said, referring to the desert lands of southern Israel.
Jordan's King Abdullah II and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas have warned that if Israel managed to drive Palestinians out of Gaza, it may want to do the same in the occupied West Bank in future.
Egypt -- which has long suppressed the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas's Islamist ally -- also has reason to fear the security implications of hosting displaced Gazans on its territory.
The presence of Palestinians refugees and militant groups has previously pulled their host countries into conflict -- Jordan in the 1970s and Lebanon in the 1980s.
In Jordan, home to many Palestinians, the late King Hussein in the 1970s accused Palestinian fedayeen fighters of building a ""state within a state"" and seeking to take over the country.
- Sinai a 'red line' -
To prevent this, Jordan's Black September offensive drove Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization to leave Jordan for Lebanon.
Lebanon's Christian parties had the same suspicion and fought the PLO during the civil war. Arafat and his fighters were forced to leave in the wake of Israel's full-scale invasion of Lebanon in 1982. 
The PLO leadership dispersed to Tunisia and Yemen, while the occupied Palestinian territories were gripped by the first intifada or uprising from 1987. 
The 1993 Oslo Accords were meant to usher in a Palestinian state, but that dream fizzled and serious talks have stalled for the past decade. 
The idea of a substitute Palestinian homeland resurfaced under former US president Donald Trump, whose peace plan, rejected as biased by Palestinians, proposed an industrial zone in the Sinai to create jobs for Gazans.
Cairo too would dismiss it out of hand, analysts say.
""The Sinai is a red line for the Egyptians,"" said political scientist Sarah Daoud, who stressed that ""this was already the case under Hosni Mubarak"", the former president deposed in 2011. 
""For Egypt, its territorial integrity is non-negotiable,"" she said.
The Sinai Peninsula, which Israel occupied from 1967, was the site of battles in which many Egyptian soldiers died, before Cairo regained it under its 1979 peace deal with Israel.
Sisi has warned that, if at some future stage Palestinian armed groups based on its lands were to attack Israel, that historic peace ""will melt in our hands"".",Tuesday 24 October 2023 - 10:28am
Deal struck to open Gaza border for aid,"GAZA CITY - US President Joe Biden on Wednesday unveiled a deal to allow desperately-needed humanitarian aid to enter war-torn Gaza, where one million people have fled their homes amid withering Israeli air strikes.
After face-to-face talks in Israel and intense telephone diplomacy with Egypt, Biden said a limited number of trucks would be allowed to cross the shuttered Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza from Friday. 
It would be the first international relief to enter Gaza since October 7, when Palestinian militant group Hamas launched shock raids into Israel, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and seizing about 200 hostages.
Since then, Israel has besieged the Palestinian enclave, launching wave after wave of air strikes, enforcing a blockade and deploying tens of thousands of troops to the border in preparation for an expected ground assault. 
The United Nations and humanitarian groups have begged for the military stranglehold on Gaza to be eased, to allow supplies of water, food, fuel and medicines to enter. 
Top UN humanitarian official Martin Griffiths on Wednesday said the situation in Gaza was dire, with hospitals overwhelmed, more than 3,000 Gazans killed and 12,500 injured.""The pace of death, of suffering, of destruction"" he said ""cannot be exaggerated.""
Despite the devastation, more than 100 trucks have been queued for days on the Egyptian side of the border waiting to enter Gaza.
Israel fears that aid deliveries could be used as cover to bring in weapons, or could be diverted into the hands of Hamas -- which governs the enclave.
Israel has already hit the border crossing with multiple air strikes since this phase of the decades-old conflict began.
Egypt controls the border and fears throwing open the gates would bring tens of thousands of refugees to its territory.
After what he described ""blunt"" negotiations and a telephone call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Biden indicated that about 20 trucks would enter Gaza to start with, with more to come if all sides agree.
""We want to get as many of the trucks out as possible,"" Biden said aboard Air Force One.
""If Hamas confiscates it or doesn't let it get through... then it's going to end, because we're not going to be sending any humanitarian aid to Hamas,"" Biden said.
Israeli officials said the deliveries would be limited to ""food, water and medicine"", and that the effort was conditional on aid not being used by Hamas. 
The UN's Griffiths estimated that about 100 trucks per day were needed to meet the needs in Gaza.",Thursday 19 October 2023 - 16:25pm
Israel faces mounting outrage over Gaza war,"JERUSALEM - Israel faced mounting international pressure over the rising civilian death toll and destruction of hospitals in Gaza, as it pressed on with its war against Hamas militants in the besieged Palestinian territory.
The United Nations Security Council was set to vote Monday on a new resolution calling for an ""urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities"" in Gaza.
The deadliest ever Gaza war began with unprecedented attacks by Hamas on October 7, when the group killed 1,139 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250, according to updated Israeli figures.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory says more than 18,800 people, mostly women and children, have died in Israel's campaign in Gaza. It said dozens were killed in Israeli strikes on Sunday.
Following months of fierce bombardment and fighting, most of Gaza's population have also been displaced and people are grappling with shortages of fuel, food, water and medicine.Fewer than one-third of Gaza's hospitals are partly functioning, according to the UN, with the World Health Organization denouncing on Sunday the impact of Israeli operations on two hospitals in the north of the territory.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the agency was ""appalled by the effective destruction"" of the Kamal Adwan hospital, where Israeli forces carried out a multi-day operation against Hamas. 
Outside the hospital courtyard, which showed tank and bulldozer tracks, Abu Mohammed, who came to look for his son, stood crying.
""I don't know how I will find him,"" he said, pointing to the debris.
The Israeli army pulled out of the hospital on Sunday after an operation lasting several days, claiming it had been used as a command and control centre by Hamas.Israel said that before entering the hospital it had negotiated safe passage for the evacuation of most of the people inside.
The WHO also said Israeli bombing had reduced the emergency department at the Al-Shifa hospital to ""a bloodbath"".
The Hamas-run health ministry said an Israeli strike on Sunday hit Nasser hospital in southern Gaza's main city of Khan Yunis, killing one person and injuring seven others.
And the ministry said Israeli forces had stormed Al Awda hospital in northern Gaza on Sunday and detained medical staff following several days of siege and bombing.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again vowed to ""fight until the end"" on Sunday, promising to achieve the aims of eliminating Hamas, freeing all hostages and ensuring that Gaza will never again become ""a centre for terrorism.""
Near Gaza's northern border crossing at the Israeli city of Erez, the Israeli army said it had uncovered the biggest Hamas tunnel so far.An AFP photographer reported that the tunnel was large enough for small vehicles to use.
Israel said the tunnel cost millions of dollars and took years to construct, featuring rails, electricity, drainage and a communications network.
- Calls for truce -
The Israeli government has come under growing pressure from the international community to pause the fighting and do more to protect civilians.
The United Nations estimates that 1.9 million Gazans -- around 80 percent -- have been displaced by the war.""I would not be surprised if people start dying of hunger, or a combination of hunger, disease, weak immunity,"" said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.
Gazans have also faced repeated communications outages but on Sunday Gaza's main telecoms firm said mobile and internet service had been gradually restored.
French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna was in Israel on Sunday, where she called for an ""immediate and durable"" truce.
France separately condemned an Israel bombardment that killed one of its foreign ministry officials in Gaza.
Qatar, which helped mediate a truce last month that saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 jailed Palestinians, said there were ""ongoing diplomatic efforts to renew the humanitarian pause"".
But Hamas said on Telegram it was ""against any negotiations for the exchange of prisoners until the aggression against our people ceases completely"".
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in Kuwait on Monday as part of a regional trip that will include stops in Israel and Qatar, which brokered a previous ceasefire deal.
- 'Daily humiliation' -
Israel is also facing calls from the families of hostages, to either slow, suspend or end the military campaign.There are 129 hostages still in Gaza, Israel says, and relatives again rallied in Tel Aviv to call for a deal to bring them home after the army admitted to mistakenly killing three of the captives in Gaza.
One hostage already freed, German-Israeli Raz Ben-Ami, 57, spoke of the ""daily humiliation, mental, physical"", she endured, including one meal a day and no proper toilets.
The conflict in Gaza has also seen violence spiral in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The Palestinian health ministry said Israeli forces killed five Palestinians on Sunday morning at a West Bank refugee camp.
Israel's army said air strikes had targeted militants who had endangered soldiers.
Health officials say more than 290 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since the war erupted.
- Syria strikes -
Fears continued to grow that the conflict in Gaza could engulf the wider region.
Israel carried out air strikes near Damascus on Sunday, wounding two Syrian soldiers, the Syrian defence ministry said.
Israeli forces and Iran-backed Hezbollah militants are exchanging regular fire across Israel's northern border with Lebanon.
Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels, saying they want to pressure Israel, have launched attacks on passing vessels in the vital Red Sea shipping zone, forcing major companies to redirect vessels.

24 hours for aid to enter Gaza before 'catastrophe': WHO,"UNITED NATIONS - The Gaza Strip has only ""24 hours of water, electricity and fuel left"", the regional head of the United Nations' World Health Organization told AFP on Monday, as pressure mounts for assistance to arrive.
If aid is not allowed into the besieged territory, doctors will have to ""prepare death certificates for their patients,"" WHO regional director for the eastern Mediterranean, Ahmed al-Mandhari, said in an interview with AFP.
Monday marked 10 days of relentless Israeli air strikes on targets in the Palestinian enclave, in retaliation for an October 7 attack by Gaza-based Hamas militants who killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, in southern Israel.
Gaza is now barrelling towards ""a real catastrophe"", Mandhari said.
The Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza said around 2,750 people have been killed and 9,700 wounded while, according to the UN, one million have been displaced.
Power outages threaten to cripple life-support systems, from sea water desalination plants to food refrigeration and hospital incubators.
Even everyday functions -- from going to the toilet, showering and washing clothes -- are almost impossible, locals say.With emergency responders overwhelmed, doctors working around the clock and a dire lack of space, ""bodies cannot be properly taken care of"", Mandhari said.
Overcrowding has paralysed hospitals, where ""intensive care units, operating rooms, emergency services and other wings"" are all on the brink of collapse, he said.
Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz on Sunday said water supplies to southern Gaza had been switched back on, a week after Israel announced a ""complete siege"" cutting water, power and fuel supplies to the territory where it wants to crush Hamas.
Depriving civilians of goods essential for survival is banned under international law, the UN human rights chief has said.
 
- Left to die -
 
During the air and artillery bombardment, the WHO has recorded 111 medical facilities targeted, 12 health care workers killed and 60 ambulances bombed -- in violation of both ""international law and the principles of humanity"", Mandhari said.
A total of 22 hospitals in nothern Gaza are treating more than 2,000 patients, including ""some on ventilators, some who need regular dialysis, in addition to children, infants and women"".
The enclave's hospitals have run out of clean water, while ""fuel shortages threaten electricity supply,"" he said.
As medical resources dry up, Mandhari said doctors -- who know they cannot save everyone -- are having to make impossible choices.
""They have to triage the patients who are coming in. They have no other choice. There are too many people, so some are left to die slow deaths.""
Aid must be allowed to enter the Gaza Strip within one day before the situation becomes completely unmanageable, Mandhari said. Convoys of international aid are waiting just across the border with Egypt, but they have been allowed no closer than the Egyptian town of El Arish, 50 kilometres (31 miles) away from the Rafah border crossing -- the only passage in and out of Gaza not controlled by Israel.
Cairo has refused to allow foreign nationals to exit without humanitarian aid coming in.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry accused Israel of blocking the aid, despite ""repeated requests"" from Cairo.
Under a joint Israeli-Egyptian blockade in place since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel has a say in the passage of all goods and people coming in and out of the territory.
United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to Israel on Monday after shuttling between Arab states, hoping to coordinate efforts against Hamas while finding ways to alleviate Gaza's humanitarian crisis. 
He announced in Cairo on Sunday that the US had appointed veteran former diplomat David Satterfield to work on aid to Gaza.
The UN's humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said he would be heading to the Middle East on Tuesday ""to try to help in the negotiations"" for aid access.
""We are in deep discussions with the Israelis, with the Egyptians and with others,"" Griffiths said.

"Intense Israeli bombardment hits southern Gaza, calls for more aid grow","JERUSALEM - The southern Gaza Strip came under intense Israeli bombardment overnight, despite international pressure for an immediate ceasefire in the Palestinian territory where famine is looming.
Besieged Gaza is in desperate need of aid and the United States said it would continue airdrops, despite pleas from Hamas to stop the practice after the Islamist group said 18 people had died trying to reach food packages.
A fireball lit up the night sky in the southern city of Rafah, the last remaining urban centre in Gaza not to have been attacked by Israeli ground forces. About 1.5 million people are crammed in the area, many having fled south towards the border with Egypt.
The sound of explosions was also heard and smoke was seen rising in Gaza City in the north, where Israeli troops have been attacking the city's largest hospital for more than a week.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said early Wednesday that 66 people had been killed overnight, including three killed in Israeli air strikes in and around Rafah.The fighting went on unabated two days after the UN Security Council passed its first resolution calling for an ""immediate ceasefire"" and urging the release of the roughly 130 hostages Israel says remain in Gaza, including 34 captives who are presumed dead.
Israeli forces have also surrounded two hospitals in Khan Yunis, where the health ministry said 12 people, including some children, were killed in an Israeli strike on a camp for the displaced.
The Palestinian Red Crescent has warned that thousands were trapped in the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis and ""their lives are in danger"".
 
- 'Man-made famine' -
 Underscoring the desperation of civilians trapped by the fighting, Hamas has asked donor countries to stop their airdrops after 12 people drowned trying to recover parachuted food aid from the sea off Gaza's Mediterranean coast.
Hamas and the Swiss-based Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor also said another six people were killed in stampedes trying to get aid.
""People are dying just to get a can of tuna,"" Gaza resident Mohamad al-Sabaawi told AFP, holding a can in his hand after a scramble over an aid package.
Hamas has also demanded that Israel allow more aid trucks to enter the territory, which the United Nations has warned is on the brink of a ""man-made famine"" after nearly six months of fighting.
The war, triggered by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, has shattered Gaza's infrastructure and aid agencies say all of its 2.4 million people are now in need of humanitarian help.The UN children's fund, UNICEF, said vastly more aid must be rushed into Gaza by road rather than by air or sea to avert an ""imminent famine"".
UNICEF spokesman James Elder said the necessary help was ""a matter of kilometres away"" in aid-filled trucks waiting across Gaza's southern border with Egypt.
The US National Security Council said in a statement it would continue trying to get aid in by road, but also said it would continue airdrops.
AFPTV footage showed crowds rushing towards aid packages on Tuesday being dropped by parachute from planes sent by Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Germany.
 
- 'Political isolation' -
 The October 7 attack resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 32,414 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry.
Israeli troops have shown no sign of a let-up in the fight against Hamas, with the military saying its jets had struck more than 60 targets, including tunnels and buildings ""in which armed terrorists were identified"".
The UN Security Council resolution passed Monday demanded a ceasefire for the remaining two weeks of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan that should lead to a ""lasting"" truce.The United States, Israel's top ally, which had blocked previous resolutions, abstained from the vote, prompting Israel to cancel a planned US visit by senior officials.
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said Israel was experiencing ""unprecedented political isolation"" and losing US ""protection"" at the Security Council.
Washington has baulked at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's determination to launch a ground assault on Rafah, and the United States has also expressed increasing concern over the humanitarian toll.
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said before meeting his Israeli counterpart that ""the number of civilian casualties is far too high, and the amount of humanitarian aid is far too low"" in Gaza.
 
- Talks 'ongoing' -
 However, both Hamas and Netanyahu said the talks were failing and blamed each other.
Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said this week the talks were ""ongoing"".
In Khan Yunis, dozens of Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles surrounded the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis.
The health ministry said shots were fired around the sprawling complex but no raid had yet taken place.
Israeli troops have also been engaged in heavy fighting at Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital, the territory's largest, for nine days. 
Israel said it has killed 170 Palestinian militants and arrested hundreds there.Palestinians living near Al-Shifa have reported corpses in the streets, constant bombardment and the rounding up of men who are stripped to their underwear and questioned.

Hamas says 200 killed in 24 hours of Israeli strikes on Gaza,"GAZA CITY - Israeli strikes in Gaza killed more than 200 people in 24 hours, Hamas-controlled authorities said, as the United States again pressed its ally to do more to protect civilians. 
Despite growing calls for restraint and for more aid to reach war-stricken Palestinians, Israel showed little sign of modulating its 11-week-old ""Operation Swords of Iron"" -- which aims to rout Hamas.
Fighting is now centred on Gaza City and the southern city of Khan Yunis, both considered strongholds of the Palestinian militant group that carried out bloody October 7 raids into Israel.
Outside a morgue at the city's Nasser Hospital, grieving relatives prayed, wept and stared vacantly as they tried to process incalculable loss.Hamas authorities said the death toll from this war has now surged beyond 20,000.
Israel denies directly targeting civilians and says the war against Hamas is vital to ensure the October raids on farms, villages and kibbutzim that killed an estimated 1,140 people can never be repeated.
In Washington, President Joe Biden said he had another ""long talk"" with Israel's hawkish prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
The White House said the discussion focused on the ""objectives and phasing"" of Israel's military operation, as well as ""the critical need to protect the civilian population including those supporting the humanitarian aid operations"".
Israeli officials gave a terse readout of the call, saying ""the Prime Minister made it clear that Israel would continue the war until all of its goals have been achieved"".

It's ordering it to increase basic humanitarian aid to Gaza, including food, water, shelter and fuel.
The court says famine is no longer a risk, but has become a reality for millions of Palestinians.
The order was the result of an application brought by South Africa.

Blinken heads to Israel to press for 'immediate' truce in Gaza war,"CAIRO - Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Israel Friday to press for a truce in Gaza, ahead of a key UN Security Council vote on a US draft resolution calling for an ""immediate"" ceasefire.
Israel's main backer the United States announced it would submit for a vote on Friday a draft to the Security Council on the need for an ""immediate ceasefire as part of a hostage deal"", after repeatedly using its veto power to block other similarly worded resolutions.
After talks in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Blinken flies to Israel on Friday, his sixth trip to the region since the war began with Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7.
Fighting in Gaza this week has centred around Al-Shifa hospital, the besieged territory's largest, with Israel also vowing to launch a new ground assault in overcrowded Rafah in the south.
Israel said its spy chief would also head back to Qatar on Friday for more truce talks with US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators who are trying to negotiate a six-week pause.
The talks are focused on securing a truce agreement, hinged on the release of hostages held by Hamas militants in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody and the delivery of more aid to Gaza, where famine is threatening its 2.4 million people.
Blinken told reporters in Cairo on Thursday ""gaps are narrowing"" and that the United States was ""continuing to push for an agreement in Doha"".
""It's difficult to get there, but I believe it is still possible,"" Blinken said.
He warned that an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city where around 1.5 million people are hemmed in by the Egyptian border, would be ""a mistake"".""There is no place for the civilians amassed in Rafah to get out of harm's way,"" Blinken said. 
""There is a better way to deal with the ongoing threat posed by Hamas.""
 
- 'Immediate, durable ceasefire' -
 
The United States will submit its draft resolution to the UN Security Council on Friday, a spokesman for the US representative to the world body said.
The US resolution ""will unequivocally support ongoing diplomatic efforts aimed at securing an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as part of a hostage deal... we will be bringing this Resolution for a vote on Friday morning,"" Nate Evans, spokesman for US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said in a statement.
After blocking an Algerian draft resolution calling for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"" in Gaza at the end of February, US officials have been negotiating an alternative text focusing on support for a six-week truce in exchange for the release of hostages.
Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza has continued despite renewed diplomatic efforts, with the death toll in Gaza close to 32,000, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
Israel's military said it had killed more than 140 Hamas fighters and arrested more than 350 since the start of its operation in and around Al-Shifa hospital on Monday.
""This is the operation in which we have apprehended the largest number of terrorists since the start of the war,"" Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Thursday evening.Israel said militants were hiding out at the vast hospital complex and civilians had not been harmed. Hamas said the attack on an area crowded with patients and people seeking refuge was a crime.
AFP images showed streams of people fleeing south from the hospital along Gaza's coast.
A 60-year-old patient who gave his name as Younis said he had been forced outside without clothes, blindfolded and interrogated before being freed.
The soldiers ""beat all the young men and arrested them"", Younis told AFP.
The Israeli military said it was working ""to identify unusual cases"" involving its troops.
 
- Children 'starving to death' -
 
The bloodiest-ever Gaza war broke was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on October 7 that resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.Militants also seized about 250 hostages. Israel believes 130 remain in Gaza, including 33 who are presumed dead.
Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas and its response has killed at least 31,988 people, most of them women and children, have been killed, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory says.
Gaza's civilian infrastructure has also largely collapsed and UN agencies are warning the battered territory's population is on the brink of famine.
A UN panel of independent experts said Thursday that children in Gaza were ""starving to death"". 
""They are cut off from food, even crumbs are not easy to find,"" said the panel that oversees compliance with the UN child rights convention.
 
- 'Strong message' -
 The head of Israel's Mossad spy agency, David Barnea, was to travel to Doha Friday to meet CIA chief William Burns, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani and Egypt's intelligence chief Abbas Kamel for further truce talks.
However, a Hamas official said Israel's response to the group's latest proposal had been ""largely negative"".
Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled to escape fighting elsewhere, is the last urban centre to be so far spared an Israeli ground assault.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted a ground incursion is the only way to root out Hamas despite warnings by Blinken, the European Union, which called on Thursday for an ""immediate humanitarian pause"" in Gaza, and others.Tensions have also flared in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 440 Palestinians since the Gaza war began, according to Palestinian officials.
The Saudi government announced this week it would donate $40 million to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, which has been central to aid operations in Gaza.burs-pbt/ser

Israel PM says army will enter Rafah despite 'international pressure',"JERUSALEM -Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israeli troops would pursue a planned ground offensive in southern Gaza's Rafah that has spurred fears of mass civilian casualties.
""No amount of international pressure will stop us from realising all the goals of the war: eliminating Hamas, releasing all our hostages and ensuring that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel,"" Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting in a video released by his office.
""To do this, we will also operate in Rafah.""
His comments came as talks were expected to resume in Doha towards a truce in Gaza, where Israel has pursued a campaign against Hamas militants for more than five months.
Israeli cabinet members were set to discuss the ""mandate"" of the negotiations team later Sunday, Netanyahu's office has said.
He was also due to meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was expected to reiterate his warning against a Rafah ground offensive.
Most of Gaza's 2.4 million people have sought refuge from relentless Israeli bombardment in the southern city.
US President Joe Biden, who has backed Israel during the war, has said an invasion of Rafah would be a ""red line"" unless credible civilian protection plans are in place.
The head of the UN's World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, appealed to Israel Friday ""in the name of humanity"" not to launch the assault.
Netanyahu's office said Friday he had approved the military's plan for an operation in Rafah, though no timeline was given.
 
- Elections would 'paralyse' Israel -
 
Rafah is the last major population centre in Gaza yet to be subjected to a ground assault in the war, which was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel.
The attack resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli figures.
Hamas took about 250 Israeli and foreign hostages on October 7, and Israel believes about 130 of those remain in Gaza including 32 presumed dead.
Israel's military campaign has killed at least 31,645 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
Netanyahu on Sunday also criticised ""those in the international community who are trying to stop the war now"" by ""making false accusations"" against Israel and its military.
Israel has faced consistent criticism for civilian casualties in Gaza as well as stark aid shortages that have fuelled fears of famine.
On Thursday, US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Israel to hold new elections, sparking angry pushback from Netanyahu's Likud party, which said Israel ""is not a banana republic"".
Netanyahu on Sunday said new elections would ""stop the war, and paralyse the country for at least six months"".
""If we stop the war now, before all of its goals are achieved, it means that Israel has lost the war, and we will not allow that.""
In his first public response against Schumer, Netanyahu branded the lawmaker's remarks ""totally inappropriate"" and insisted most Israelis back the war.
""If Senator Schumer opposes these policies, he's not opposing me; he's opposing the people of Israel,"" Netanyahu told CNN on Sunday.
Meanwhile, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby warned of ""concerns"" about Israel's looming Rafah operation.
""We will not support, cannot support, an operation in Rafah that doesn't have an executable, verifiable, achievable plan to take care of the 1.5 million people that are trying to find refuge in Rafah,"" Kirby told Fox News Sunday.
Biden's administration ""would certainly welcome"" an opportunity to study the Rafah plan before the operation, Kirby added. 
""We haven't seen it yet.""

Israel PM orders army to prepare to evacuate civilians from Gaza's Rafah,"JERUSALEM - Israeli air strikes pummelled densely crowded Rafah on Saturday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered his troops to ""prepare to operate"" in the southern border city that has become a last holdout for displaced Palestinians.
Netanyahu's planned offensive on Rafah, where an estimated 1.3 million people have sought refuge, has drawn condemnation from rights groups and Washington, while Palestinians have said they have nowhere left to retreat.
Witnesses reported new strikes on Rafah early Saturday, after the Israeli military intensified air raids, with fears rising among Palestinians of a coming ground invasion.
""We don't know where to go,"" said Mohammad al-Jarrah, a Palestinian who was displaced from further north to Rafah.
The city is the last major population centre in the Gaza Strip that Israeli troops have yet to enter but is also the main point of entry for desperately needed relief supplies.
Netanyahu told military officials on Friday to ""submit to the cabinet a combined plan for evacuating the population and destroying the battalions"" of Hamas militants holed up in Rafah, his office said.The US State Department said it does not support a ground offensive in Rafah, warning that, if not properly planned, such an operation risks ""disaster"".
The United States is Israel's main international backer, providing it with billions of dollars in military aid.
But in a sign of his growing frustration with Israel's leadership, President Joe Biden issued his strongest criticism yet of the conduct of the war, describing the retaliation for Hamas's October 7 attack as going too far.
""I'm of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in Gaza, in the Gaza Strip, has been over the top,"" the US president said.
""There are a lot of innocent people who are starving... in trouble and dying, and it's got to stop.""
 
- 'Die in our homes' -
 
Palestinians displaced from other Gaza towns and cities have flooded into Rafah, where hundreds of thousands are sleeping in tents pushed up against the Egyptian border.
AFP images showed scenes of devastation in Rafah's streets, where people queued for increasingly scarce water.Rights groups have sounded alarm at the prospect of a ground incursion there.
""Israel's declared ground offensive on Rafah would be catastrophic and must not proceed,"" Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. ""There is no place that is safe in Gaza and no way for people to leave.""
The Palestinian Red Crescent said on Friday that three children were killed in a strike in Rafah.""We heard the sound of a huge explosion next to our house... we found two children martyred in the street,"" said Jaber al-Bardini, 60.
""There is no safe place in Rafah. If they storm Rafah we will die in our homes. We have no choice. We don't want to go anywhere else.""
The Israeli army said its forces had ""eliminated 15 terrorists"" in the past day in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza's biggest city.
Israeli forces raided the city's Al-Amal Hospital on Friday after a weeks-long siege during which the Palestinian Red Crescent has reported ""intense artillery shelling and heavy gunfire"".
The medical organisation said Israeli forces had arrested eight of its team members at the hospital, including ""four doctors, as well as four wounded individuals and five patients' companions"".UN chief Antonio Guterres has said any Israeli push into Rafah ""would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare"".
But Netanyahu's office said it would be ""impossible"" to achieve the war's objective of eliminating Hamas while leaving four of the militants' battalions in Rafah.
Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.In response, Israel vowed to eradicate Hamas and launched air strikes and a ground offensive that have killed at least 27,947 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
Militants seized 250 hostages, 132 of whom are still in Gaza, but 29 are presumed dead, Israel has said.
 
- Ceasefire talks -
 
State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said an Israeli ground operation in Rafah was ""not something we'd support"".
""To conduct such an operation right now with no planning and little thought... would be a disaster,"" Patel warned.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had conveyed Washington's concerns to Netanyahu directly during talks this week in Jerusalem, he added.On the ceasefire talks, Blinken insisted he still saw ""space for agreement to be reached"" to halt the fighting and bring home Israeli hostages, even after Netanyahu rejected what he labelled Hamas's ""bizarre demands"".
Hamas negotiators left Cairo on Friday after what a Hamas source described as ""positive and good discussions"" with Egyptian and Qatari mediators on a new Gaza truce and an exchange of hostages for prisoners.
""The delegation left Cairo tonight (Friday) and is awaiting Israel's response,"" a Hamas official told AFP on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the issue.
 
- Far-reaching impact -
 
The impact of the war has been felt widely, with violence involving Iran-backed allies of Hamas across the Middle East surging since October and drawing in US forces among others.
Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said on Friday it fired dozens of rockets at an army position in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, hours after launching a salvo at northern Israel.
Friday's attack came as Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian arrived in Beirut for talks with senior officials.Due to the ongoing war and risk of wider consequences, the US ratings agency Moody's downgraded Israel's credit rating on Friday, and also lowered its outlook for Israel's debt to ""negative"" due to ""the risk of an escalation"" with Hezbollah.

"Gaza war tensions spike after deadly Iran blasts, Lebanon killing","JERUSALEM - Fears that Israel's war in Gaza could spiral across the Middle East mounted Wednesday after twin explosions ripped through an Iranian crowd, claiming at least 103 lives following a strike in Lebanon that killed Hamas's deputy leader.
More than 200 other people were wounded when the blasts about 15 minutes apart struck mourners commemorating slain Revolutionary Guards general Qasem Soleimani on the fourth anniversary of his killing in a United States drone strike, Iran's state media reported. 
No group claimed responsibility for the blasts which, according to AFP archives, were the country's deadliest attack since a 1978 arson that killed at least 377 people.
State-run TV labelled the blasts a ""terrorist attack"". They came with regional tensions already soaring a day after the Beirut strike which killed Hamas number two Saleh al-Aruri.
A US official on Wednesday told AFP ""an Israeli strike"" took the life of Aruri, the most high-profile figure killed during the nearly three months that Israel has been at war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.Following Tuesday's unclaimed Beirut attack, Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said the military was ""highly prepared for any scenario"". He did not comment directly on the killing of Aruri, who Hamas said will be buried on Thursday in Beirut's Shatila Palestinian refugee camp.
Israel and Iran have long been bitter enemies. Violence involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen has spiked during the Gaza war sparked by the unprecedented October 7 attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on southern Israel.
There have been repeated, deadly exchanges of fire across the Lebanon-Israel border, attacks on shipping in the Red Sea area vital for global trade, and strikes against US-led coalition forces in Iraq and Syria.
More intense wider warfare has so far been avoided, but the Iran blasts rattled global markets, sending oil prices up by more than three percent.
Following the Aruri killing, Germany warned its citizens to leave Lebanon quickly and said, ""further deterioration of the situation and expansion of the conflict cannot be ruled out"". 
- Cross-border fire -
 
The bloodiest-ever Gaza war started after the Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the death of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Militants took around 250 hostages back to Hamas-ruled Gaza, 129 of whom remain in captivity, according to Israel.In response to the deadliest attack in its history, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, launching a relentless bombardment and ground invasion that has reduced swathes of Gaza to rubble and claimed at least 22,313 lives, according to the territory's health ministry.
The United Nations estimates 1.9 million Gazans are displaced, and the World Health Organization has warned of the risk of famine and disease, with only a minimal amount of aid entering.
After Tuesday's killing of Aruri, Lebanon's Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah blamed its foe Israel for the strike in its Shiite Muslim stronghold of southern Beirut.
Although Israel did not claim the assassination, Hamas and Lebanese security sources accused it of killing Aruri, 57, a founder of the Hamas military wing.  Hezbollah vowed the killing of Aruri and six other Hamas operatives would not go unpunished, labelling it ""a serious assault on Lebanon... and a dangerous development"".
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned Israel against all-out war on the country to its north. But in a televised speech he also said Israel has sent ""messages"" that it was ""settling scores"" with Hamas leaders and did not intend to target Lebanon or Hezbollah.
During the Israel-Hamas war, including on Wednesday, Israel has traded regular cross-border fire with militants, mainly Hamas ally Hezbollah.
Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said the Beirut strike proved Israel ""has not achieved any of its goals"".A few hours after those remarks, blasts in Soleimani's hometown of Kerman, Iran, tore through crowds gathered to honour Soleimani, the commander killed in a 2020 Baghdad drone strike by Israel's top ally the US.
Soleimani headed the Quds Force, the foreign operations arm of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, setting Iran's political and military agenda across the region.
Iran declared Thursday a day of mourning. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed ""evil and criminal enemies of the Iranian nation"" and said: ""This disaster will have a harsh response, God willing.""
Following the blasts, President Ebrahim Raisi cancelled a Thursday visit to Turkey.Saudi Arabia, which last year reconciled with Iran after a seven-year diplomatic rupture, expressed ""sincere condolences, sympathy and solidarity with Iran in this painful event"".
Washington also expressed sympathy ""to the victims and their loved ones,"" while calling ""ridiculous"" any suggestion of US involvement.
""We have no reason to believe that Israel was involved in this explosion,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller added.
Israeli military spokesman Hagari did not comment when asked about the Iran blasts. ""We are ready on all fronts,"" he said.
 
- 'Settling the score' -
 
Israel has vowed to kill commanders of the Hamas Islamist movement, which is considered a ""terrorist"" group by the United States and European Union.
The head of Mossad, David Barnea, said Israel's spy agency ""is committed to settling the score with the murderers"" who carried out the October 7, and with Hamas's leadership. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned the strike that killed Aruri was ""an additional factor that can cause an escalation of the conflict"". 
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Palestinian territory where Aruri was born, the Palestinian Authority called a general strike to mourn his death.
During the Israel-Hamas war violence in the West Bank has surged to levels unseen in nearly two decades, with at least 321 Palestinians killed by Israeli troops or settlers, the Palestinian health ministry said.
At a protest in Ramallah on Wednesday against Aruri's killing, one resident, Hala Abu Gharbiyeh, said his death will not affect ""the resistance.""In Israel's northern coastal city of Nahariya, near the border with Lebanon, many people are carrying weapons. Residents said they fear Aruri's killing could spark war in their region.
""We're scared,"" said Lee Zorviv, a clothing store owner.

"Blinken, Jordan raise Palestinian needs as Israel readies Gaza move"," 
AMMAN - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Jordan's king Friday about how to address a looming humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip as Israel readies a US-supported offensive following deadly attacks by Hamas.
Blinken huddled with King Abdullah II as well as Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in Amman at the start of a tour of six Arab countries that will also take the top US diplomat to Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
The Jordanian king, a longtime US partner, called for ""opening humanitarian corridors to allow for the entry of urgent medical and relief aid to Gaza, and protecting civilians and stopping the escalation and war on Gaza,"" a statement from the royal court said.
Blinken spent Thursday in Tel Aviv where he promised unwavering solidarity to US ally Israel after Hamas militants breached Israel's southern border on Saturday, killing over 1,200 people and taking about 150 more hostage.
Israel on Friday called on 1.1 million people to move south in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, which is already under an Israeli blockade. 
Israel has killed more than 1,530 people in strikes in the Gaza Strip since the Hamas attack and has cut off food, water and electricity.
Blinken spoke with King Abdullah on ""ways to address the humanitarian needs of civilians in Gaza while Israel conducts legitimate security operations to defend itself from terrorism,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. 
US officials are working with Egypt, which also borders Gaza and was the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, on a plan for a safety corridor from Gaza.
But Jordan, home to two million Palestinian refugees, warned against permanent displacement.
""The crisis should not be spread to neighbouring countries and exacerbate the refugee issue,"" the king told Blinken, according to the palace.
Hamas is financially backed by US arch-enemy Iran but also has longstanding ties with US partner Qatar, which has been seen as an intermediary in freeing the hostages.
""We'll continue pressing countries to help prevent the conflict from spreading, and to use their leverage with Hamas to immediately and unconditionally release the hostages,"" Blinken said late Thursday in Tel Aviv.
Saudi Arabia in the weeks before the attacks had spoken of progress in US-led diplomacy to normalise relations with Israel -- a landmark step for the conservative kingdom that is guardian of Islam's two holiest sites.
Few expect the momentum to be maintained, with the Saudis joining Qatar in blaming Israeli policies towards the Palestinians for the flare-up in violence.
 
- Working with Abbas -
 The nearly 88-year-old Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority enjoys small levels of autonomy in the West Bank, is a sworn foe of Hamas, whose control of the Gaza Strip has led to a 17-year Israeli blockade.
Blinken entered his private residence in Amman and shook hands next to a painting that depicted the veteran Palestinian leader superimposed in front of Islam's holy Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.
The United States under President Joe Biden and other Democrats has largely been supportive of the Palestinian Authority, seeing it as the best option for long-term peace with Israel.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long sought to sideline the Palestinian Authority and Abbas, saying he is insufficiently committed to stopping violence, with the hard-right Israeli government rejecting the prospect of a two-state solution.
Abbas made his first public remarks on the conflict on Thursday after meeting King Abdullah.
Abbas called for ""an immediate end to the comprehensive aggression against the Palestinian people"" and rejected ""practices related to killing civilians or abusing them on both sides"".
Blinken earlier spoke to Abbas by telephone about the attacks, urging him to condemn the violence and maintain stability in the West Bank.

Israel allows two fuel tankers into Gaza daily as aid halted,"GAZA - Israel has agreed to allow two fuel trucks a day into Gaza, Israeli officials said Friday, after the UN warned shortages had halted aid deliveries and put people at risk of starvation.
The situation was dire at the Al-Shifa hospital, the largest in Gaza. Israel's army said it was still searching the sprawling complex for suspected hideouts of fighters from the Islamist movement's armed wing.
Hamas rejects an Israeli charge that it has a command centre at the hospital, where thousands of people, including wounded patients and premature babies, are believed to be inside. The hospital also denies the claim.
Israel has vowed to ""crush"" Hamas in response to the group's October 7 attack, when it broke through Gaza's militarised border to kill about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and take about 240 hostage, according to Israeli officials.
The army's aerial bombing and ground campaign has killed about 11,500 people, including thousands of children, according to Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007.
In response to a US request, Israel's war cabinet unanimously decided to allow ""the entry of two diesel fuel tankers per day for the needs of the UN to support water and sewer infrastructure... provided that it does not reach Hamas"", Israeli officials said.The announcement came hours after the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said its aid trucks were unable to enter Gaza from Egypt for a second consecutive day due to the lack of fuel and a near-total communications blackout.
In a statement, the agency said it would be unable to ""manage or coordinate humanitarian convoys"" from Friday because of the telecommunications outage.
""The situation in Al-Shifa is catastrophic"" for patients, displaced people and health workers who are crammed inside without electricity, water and food, the hospital's director, Mohammed Abu Salmiya, told AFP on the phone later during a brief restoration of communications.
Israel has defended its Al-Shifa operation, with the military saying it found rifles, ammunition, explosives and the entrance to a tunnel shaft at the hospital complex.
- 'Anxiety and panic' -
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged hostages may even have been held at the medical facility.
""We had strong indications that they were held in the Shifa Hospital, which is one of the reasons we entered the hospital,"" he told ""CBS Evening News"".""If they were (there), they were taken out,"" he said.
Israel said its forces were searching Al-Shifa ""one building at a time"".
The army said it struck numerous targets in Gaza overnight Thursday-Friday, locating rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles at a post of the Islamic Jihad militant group in the north of the territory.It said troops killed Hamas members at a school where they found a ""large number of weapons"".
The military also said troops had recovered the remains of kidnapped woman soldier Noa Marciano, 19, ""from a structure adjacent to Al-Shifa hospital"".
It had confirmed her death this week, without giving the cause. Hamas said she had been killed in Israeli bombing.
On Thursday the army said soldiers near Al-Shifa found the body of another hostage. Yehudit Weiss, 65, had been kidnapped from the border kibbutz community of Beeri.
- 'Civilians face starvation' -
The Israeli government has come under increasing pressure to back up its allegations that Hamas is using hospitals as command centres.The United States has stood behind its ally, however, with President Joe Biden this week saying he had asked Israel to be ""incredibly careful"" in its military moves around Gaza hospitals.
More than half of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functional, due to either combat, damage, or shortages, and Israel's raid on Al-Shifa left extensive damage to the radiology, burns and dialysis unit, Hamas said.
AFPTV video showed Palestinians paying their last respects to loved ones on Friday as around a dozen bodies shrouded in white were laid out in front of the Indonesian hospital at Beit Lahia in north Gaza.
On Thursday, Jews and Arabs had come together for the funeral of another casualty of the Beeri attack -- peace activist Vivian Silver, who was hailed as an ""extraordinary woman"".
Negotiations are ongoing for the release of the hostages, including children, in exchange for a pause in fighting.
Qatar, where Hamas has political offices, and Egypt have been mediating what Egypt has described as ""very delicate"" discussions.More than 1.5 million people have been internally displaced, and Israel's blockade of the territory means ""civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation"", World Food Programme head Cindy McCain said.
UNRWA said 70 percent of people have no access to clean water in south Gaza, where raw sewage had started to flow on the streets.
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), described children sheltering at a UN school ""pleading for a sip of water, or for a loaf of bread"".
- West Bank violence -
Israel's ground operation has so far focused on north Gaza, where it has announced the seizure of key buildings and a port. It says 51 of its troops have been killed.Alongside the war in Gaza, there is growing concern about violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians has surged.
Raids by Israel's military, which says it is responding to ""a significant rise in terrorist attacks"", have also multiplied in the West Bank where the Palestinian death toll has soared.
The Israeli army said on Friday it had killed at least seven militants in two separate confrontations in the West Bank.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged Israel to take ""urgent"" action to ""de-escalate tensions in the West Bank, including by confronting rising levels of settler extremist violence,"" the State Department said.And on the northern border with Lebanon, the Israeli army said it struck several targets of the Hezbollah militant group and responded to fire from across the frontier.
The group of independent global leaders known as The Elders called on Biden to embrace a ""historic opportunity"" and deliver a peace plan between the Israelis and Palestinians.
""As polarisation increases, the world needs you to set out a vision for peace,"" they said in an open letter, stressing the plan ""must recognise the equal rights of Palestinians and Israelis.""

Tech firms struggle as Israel-Gaza falsehoods explode,"USA - From fake accounts impersonating journalists to war-themed video games fueling false narratives, tech platforms are struggling to contain a tsunami of misinformation around Palestinian-Israeli hostilities after rolling back content moderation policies.
While major world events typically trigger a deluge of falsehoods, researchers say the scale and speed with which misinformation proliferated online following the weekend's deadly assault on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas was unlike ever before.
The conflict, experts say, offers a grim case study of the diminished ability of prominent platforms such as Meta-owned Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, to combat false information in a climate of layoffs and cost-cutting that have gutted trust and safety teams.
Aggravating the problem on the Elon Musk-owned X, in particular, are a slew of contentious measures such as the restoration of accounts pushing bogus conspiracies and an ad revenue sharing program with content creators that researchers say incentivizes engagement instead of accuracy.
Experts fear these moves have increased the risk of misinformation provoking real-world harm, amplifying hate and violence especially in a fast-evolving crisis scenario such as the one unfolding in Israel and Gaza.
""Social media platforms are struggling to keep up with the constant churn of misinformation and incitements to violence,"" Andy Carvin, from the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), told AFP.
""It's a trend that's been building for some time now, and it's only gotten worse with layoffs impacting trust and safety teams, hampering their ability to keep up with the chaos.
""And in the case of X, changes to the platform have utterly shattered what was previously one of its greatest strengths -- monitoring breaking news and helping users separate fact from fiction.""
 
- 'Flood of grifters' -
 
Social media users are being bombarded with fake combat photos, old videos from Syria repurposed to look like they were taken from Gaza, and conflict-themed video game footage being passed off as a scene from a Hamas attack, misinformation researchers say.
An image circulating online purported to show Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas, but AFP factcheckers found the picture was taken in 2022 during a military exercise in Gaza.
AFP factcheckers also found several posts on X, Facebook and TikTok promoted a fake White House document allocating $8 billion in military assistance to Israel.
""The sheer amount of doctored, fake, old videos and images of attacks circulating (online) is making it harder to understand what is going on"" in Israel and Gaza, said Alessandro Accorsi, a senior analyst at the Crisis Group think tank.
Accorsi voiced ""huge concern"" that the misinformation, especially fake images of hostages including children, could stoke violence. 
""In crises like terrorist atrocities, wars and natural disasters, people tend to descend on social media platforms for quickly accessible information,"" Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, told AFP.
""(But) the flood of grifters spreading lies and hate to garner engagement and followers, combined with algorithms that promote this extreme and disturbing content, is why social media is in fact such a bad place to access reliable information.""
 
- 'Fundamentally broken' -
 
Making matters worse, tech platforms appear to be abandoning efforts to elevate quality information.
Social media traffic to top news websites from platforms such as Facebook and X has fallen off a cliff over the past year, according to data cited by US media from the research firm Similarweb.
Last week, X stripped headlines from news articles shared by users, with links now appearing only as pictures, a move that experts say could further reduce traffic to news sites.
Musk himself courted harsh criticism when he encouraged his nearly 160 million followers on X to follow two ""good"" accounts for updates on the war. Both accounts are known purveyors of misinformation.
Musk later deleted his post but not before it racked up millions of views. X did not respond to AFP's request for comment.
""Even though there are still countless talented journalists and researchers continuing to use X to help the public better understand what's going on, the signal-to-noise ratio has become intolerable,"" said DFRLab's Carvin.
""Its utility as a reliable research and reporting tool is fundamentally broken and may never recover."" ",Tuesday 10 October 2023 - 07:33am
Gaza civilian deaths test Israel's AI precision claims,"The Israeli military has said AI helps it more accurately target militants in its five-month war against Hamas, but as Gaza deaths rise, experts are questioning how effective algorithms can really be.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip says the war has killed upwards of 30,000 people, the majority of them civilians.
""Either the AI is as good as claimed and the IDF (Israeli military) doesn't care about collateral damage, or the AI is not as good as claimed,"" Toby Walsh, chief scientist at the University of New South Wales AI Institute in Australia, told AFP.
The health ministry does not specify how many militants are included in the Gaza toll.
Israel has said its forces ""eliminated 10,000 terrorists"" since the war began in early October, triggered by a deadly Hamas attack on southern Israel.
Israel's claimed use of algorithms adds another layer of concern for activists already alarmed by artificial intelligence-powered hardware like drones and gunsights that are being deployed in Gaza.
The Israeli military told AFP it had no comment on its AI targeting systems.
But the army has repeatedly claimed its forces target only militants and take measures to avoid harm to civilians.
 
- 'Precise attacks' -
 Israel began hyping AI-powered targeting after an 11-day conflict in Gaza during May 2021, which commanders branded the world's ""first AI war"".
The military chief during the 2021 war, Aviv Kochavi, told Israeli news website Ynet last year that the force had used AI systems to identify ""100 new targets every day"".
""In the past, we would produce 50 targets in Gaza in a year,"" he said.
The current Gaza offensive began when Hamas launched an attack on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Weeks later, a blog entry on the Israeli military's website said its AI-enhanced ""targeting directorate"" had identified more than 12,000 targets in just 27 days.
An unnamed Israeli official was quoted as saying the AI system, called Gospel, produced targets ""for precise attacks on infrastructure associated with Hamas, inflicting great damage on the enemy and minimal harm to those not involved"".
But an anonymous former Israeli intelligence officer, quoted in November by independent Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine, described Gospel's work as creating a ""mass assassination factory"".
Citing an intelligence source, the report said Gospel crunches vast amounts of data faster than ""tens of thousands of intelligence officers"" and identifies, in real time, locations likely to be used by suspected militants.
However, the sources gave no detail of the data put into the system or the criteria used to determine the targets.
 
- 'Dubious data' -
 Several experts told AFP the military was likely to be feeding the system with drone footage, social media posts, information from agents on the ground, mobile phone locations and other surveillance data.
Once the system identifies a target, it could use population data from official sources to estimate the likelihood of civilian harm.
But Lucy Suchman, professor of anthropology of science and technology at Britain's Lancaster University, said the idea that more data would produce better targets was untrue.
Algorithms are trained to find patterns in data that match a certain designation -- in the Gaza conflict, possibly ""Hamas affiliate"", she said.
Any pattern in the data matching a previously identified affiliate would generate a new target, but any ""questionable assumptions"" would be amplified, Suchman explained.
""In other words, more dubious data equals worse systems.""
 
- Humans in control -
 The Israelis are not the first fighting force to deploy automated targeting on the battlefield.
As far back as the 1990-91 Gulf War, the US military worked on algorithms to improve targeting.
For the 1999 Kosovo bombing campaign, NATO began using algorithms to calculate potential civilian casualties.
And the US military had hired secretive data firm Palantir to provide battlefield analytics in Afghanistan.
Backers of the technology have repeatedly insisted it will reduce civilian deaths.
But some military analysts are sceptical that the technology is advanced enough to be trusted.
In a blog post for the British Royal United Services Institute defence think-tank, analyst Noah Sylvia said last month that humans would still need to cross-check every output.
The Israeli military is ""one of the most technologically advanced and integrated militaries in the world"", he said.
But ""the odds of even the IDF using an AI with such a degree of sophistication and autonomy are low"".",Sunday 03 March 2024 - 13:00pm
Aid efforts intensify for famine-stalked Gaza,"RAFAH - Efforts grew on Thursday to get more aid into the war-devastated Gaza Strip, where the UN warns of famine and desperate residents have stormed relief shipments.
READ: Aid ship sails to Gaza as Israel-Hamas war grinds on
After mediators failed to reach a truce between Israel and Hamas militants for the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan, which started on Monday, fighting continued with at least 69 deaths over the previous 24 hours, the Hamas-run territory's health ministry said.
Hamas authorities reported more than 40 air strikes across Gaza, from Beit Hanun in the north to Rafah in the south, where most of Gaza's population has sought refuge and Israel is threatening a ground invasion.
Among the latest casualties, according to the health ministry, were seven people killed when Israeli troops opened fire on a group at an aid distribution point near Gaza City. The army had no immediate comment.The charity vessel Open Arms, pulling about 200 tonnes of food aid, was nearing Israel's coast after departing Cyprus on Tuesday, the Marinetraffic website showed on Thursday.
Cyprus's foreign minister said a second, bigger vessel was being readied in Larnaca port for the maritime corridor which, senior United States administration officials have said, will later be complemented by a temporary pier off Gaza to be built by American troops.
Daily aid airdrops by multiple nations have been taking place this month, and Germany said it would join the effort.
- 'No alternative' -
But the air and sea missions are ""no alternative"" to land deliveries, 25 organisations including Amnesty International and Oxfam said in a statement.""While a convoy of five trucks has the capacity to carry about 100 tonnes of lifesaving assistance, recent airdrops delivered only a few tonnes of aid each,"" they said.
Agnes Callamard, Amnesty's secretary general, added that the international community seems to have accepted that the war will drag on.
""Why are you making an investment that is going to take two months?"" she asked, referring to the Pentagon's timeline for setting up the temporary pier which, it said, could enable the provision of more than two million meals a day.The war began on 7 October when Hamas militants attacked Israel, resulting in about 1,160 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP count based on official figures.
The militants also seized about 250 Israeli and foreign hostages, dozens of whom were released during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes about 130 of the captives remain in Gaza and that 32 are dead.
Activists and families of Israeli hostages on Thursday kept up pressure for their release, again blocking a Tel Aviv highway in protest.
Vowing to destroy Hamas after the October 7 attack, Israel has carried out a relentless campaign of bombardment and ground operations in Gaza, killing at least 31,341 people, most of them civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.
The United Nations has reported difficulty in accessing Gaza's north with aid.
- Food warehouse hit -
On Tuesday the Israeli military said the UN's World Food Programme had sent an initial six aid trucks directly into northern Gaza as part of a pilot project.While efforts continue to get more assistance to the territory's 2.4 million people, the main United Nations aid agency in Gaza, UNRWA, said on Wednesday that an Israeli strike hit one of its food distribution warehouses in Rafah, killing an employee and wounding 22.
The agency's chief, Philippe Lazzarini, said the attack ""comes as food supplies are running out, hunger is widespread and, in some areas, turning into famine"".
Israel said later a Hamas militant was killed in a strike on Rafah and identified him as Muhammad Abu Hasna. Gaza's health ministry said he was one of four people killed in the strike.
Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the United Nations secretary-general, told reporters that ""the Israeli army received the coordinates... of this facility"".
It is the latest point of tension between Israel and UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, since Israel accused several UNRWA employees -- out of around 30,000 it employs in the Middle East -- of involvement in the attack that started the war.
Cypriot Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos hosted a virtual meeting on Wednesday with United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other foreign officials to discuss the maritime corridor.They also called on Israel to open Ashdod port, north of Gaza, to complement the Mediterranean corridor.
Senior officials would gather in Cyprus on Monday for ""in-depth"" briefings on the sea route, and would also discuss a possible ""common fund"" to support it, the statement said.
- 'Humanitarian island' -
The Spanish charity vessel Open Arms left Cyprus for Gaza on Tuesday. It is towing a barge with 200 tonnes of aid, marking the first voyage along the sea corridor.Open Arms is a partner of the American charity World Central Kitchen founded by Jose Andres. He wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that a jetty to receive the aid had reached nearly 60 metres (yards) in length.
His post included images of a bulldozer working on a promontory whose location was not given.
Israel's army said the Open Arms vessel ""underwent a comprehensive security check and was accompanied by Israeli officials to ensure that humanitarian aid alone reaches the Gaza Strip"".
By the shore in northern Gaza men including Eid Ayub waited.Whether by sea or air, the aid was not enough, Ayub said. ""When this aid arrives, there's no entity to distribute it,"" he said, adding that merchants were taking advantage of shortages.
Around 1.5 million Palestinians have sought refuge along Gaza's southern border with Egypt in Rafah, where Israel has threatened to send in troops against Hamas.
Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, late on Wednesday said ""a significant amount"" of those people, at least, would need to be moved ""to a humanitarian island that we will create with the international community"".

Israel to shift some troops north as negotiators push for Gaza ceasefire,"KHAN YUNIS - The Israeli army was preparing to shift some of its forces from the Gaza Strip to the restive Lebanese border, as international mediators pushed for a new deal to halt its war with Hamas.
With Gazans already facing dire humanitarian conditions, the United Nations chief was set to meet on Tuesday with key donors who paused funding after members of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency were accused of taking part in the October 7 attack that sparked the war.
Fears of a widening regional conflict were compounded after Israel's top ally Washington vowed to respond to an attack that killed three US troops in Jordan.
Israeli ground forces backed by tanks have been focused on Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas's Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, where the Palestine Red Crescent Society reported artillery fire around the Al-Amal hospital overnight.
Sinwar's office, military sites and ""a significant rocket manufacturing facility"" were raided by troops, the Israeli military said. 
Chief spokesman Daniel Hagari said Monday that the Israeli military had ""eliminated over 2,000 terrorists above and below ground"" in the Khan Yunis area, without offering evidence.
Israeli strikes across the besieged Gaza Strip killed 128 people overnight, the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory said early on Tuesday.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said late Monday that some units in Gaza were ""moving up to the north and preparing for what's to come"" -- a reference to the Israeli-Lebanese border, where there have been almost daily exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah militants aligned with Hamas.",Tuesday 30 January 2024 - 09:30am

UN chief warns Gaza growing more desperate 'by the hour',"KATHMANDU - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday warned the situation in Hamas-ruled Gaza is declining rapidly as he repeated desperate appeals for a ceasefire to end the ""nightmare"" of bloodshed.
""The situation in Gaza is growing more desperate by the hour. I regret that instead of a critically needed humanitarian pause, supported by the international community, Israel has intensified its military operations,"" Guterres said on a visit to Nepal's capital Kathmandu.
""The number of civilians who have been killed and injured is totally unacceptable.""
Israel unleashed its massive retaliation after Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and seizing 230 hostages, according to Israeli officials.
After weeks of heavy bombardment of Gaza, which the Palestinian health ministry said has claimed over 8,000 lives, the Israeli army said ""stage two"" of the war started with ground incursions since late Friday.
Panic and fear have surged inside Gaza, where over one million people are displaced, and where communications went dark for days after Israel cut internet lines, although connectivity had gradually returned early Sunday.
""The world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe taking place before our eyes,"" Guterres added.
""More than two million people, with nowhere safe to go, are being denied the essentials for life –- food, water, shelter and medical care –- while being subjected to relentless bombardment. I urge all those with responsibility to step back from the brink.""",Sunday 29 October 2023 - 13:05pm
Blinken back in Israel as deadliest Gaza war grinds on,"The Israeli army bombed Gaza and battled Hamas fighters on Tuesday as US top diplomat Antony Blinken was back in Israel on a regional tour aimed at stopping the war from escalating across the Middle East.
An AFP correspondent reported intense strikes overnight in Khan Yunis and Rafah, the biggest cities in the south of the besieged Palestinian territory which are crowded with internally displaced people.  
The army said its forces had killed 40 militants over the past 24 hours in ""expanded ground operations including air strikes"" in Khan Yunis, and that troops had seized AK-47 assault rifles, rocket launchers and other weapons.Israel has traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah for three months and more recently killed senior operatives of the Shiite Muslim militant group as well as of Hamas on Lebanese soil, sparking anger and threats of retaliation.
Hezbollah said Tuesday it had launched a drone attack on Israel's ""northern command centre"" in the city of Safed as part of its response to the killings of Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri and Hezbollah field commander Wissam Tawil.
The Israeli army confirmed that a ""hostile aircraft"" had come down at one of its bases in the north and said that ""no injuries or damage were reported"".The Israeli army also said Monday it had killed a ""central"" Hamas figure in Syria, Hassan Akasha, who had led ""terrorist cells which fired rockets... toward Israeli territory"".
The US secretary of state -- on his fourth Middle East tour since the war broke out -- was back in Israel where he held talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Blinken earlier pointed at ""the incredibly challenging times for Israel"", the fate of hostages remaining in Gaza and ""the relentless efforts to bring everyone home"", after talks with President Isaac Herzog.""I think there actually are real opportunities there but we have to get through this very challenging moment,"" Blinken said after meeting Foreign Minister Israel Katz on the latest leg of a tour that has already taken him to Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
 
- 'Heavy price' -
 
The bloodiest ever Gaza war broke out after Hamas gunmen launched their October 7 attack that resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.Militants of Hamas, considered a ""terrorist"" group by the United States and European Union, also took around 250 hostages. Israel says 132 of them remain captive, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.
Israel has responded to the deadliest attack in its history with relentless bombardment, a siege and then a ground invasion of Gaza that have killed at least 23,210 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
The Israeli army says its death toll inside Gaza had risen to 185 after nine soldiers were killed on Monday.
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, speaking in Qatar on Tuesday, argued that the October 7 attack ""came after an attempt to marginalise the Palestinian cause"".
He charged that, ""despite the heavy price, the massacres and the war of genocide, it (Israel) failed to achieve any of its goals.""In further comments, released later by Hamas in Gaza, he called on Muslim states ""to support the resistance with weapons, because this is... not the battle of the Palestinian people alone"".  
The war has reduced vast areas of Gaza to rubble and displaced most of its 2.4 million people with many at risk of famine and disease, according to the United Nations. 
With only minimal aid entering Gaza, Israeli human rights group B'Tselem charged that ""everyone in Gaza is going hungry"" as the ""direct results of Israel's declared policy"".
 
- More aid needed -
 
Washington has said Blinken will press Israel on its compliance with international humanitarian law and ask for ""immediate measures"" to boost aid into Gaza, where relief has arrived only in sporadic convoys.
US President Joe Biden said Monday he had been ""quietly working with the Israeli government to get them to reduce"" their troop presence in Gaza.The Israeli army has claimed to have largely achieved military control over northern Gaza, and said that the war is now entering a new phase. 
Army spokesman Daniel Hagari, speaking to The New York Times, said the next phase would involve fewer soldiers and air strikes and that a troop reduction had already begun this month.
Hagari alluded to the transition in his nightly briefing on Monday, saying that ""while there are still terrorists and weapons in the north, they are no longer functioning within an organised military framework"".
But he also acknowledged there were tough ""battles being fought both in the centre and the south"" of Gaza, where intense urban combat and house-to-house fighting have raged for weeks.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking in Cairo, also stressed the need for ""less intensive"" combat and greater aid flows, while reiterating Berlin's solid support for Israel.The United Nations said it was ""very concerned by the high death toll of media workers"" in Gaza, a day after a strike killed two journalists of the Al Jazeera network, including the son of Gaza bureau chief Wael al-Dahdouh.
Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli police confirmed three people were killed Monday during a raid on Tulkarem to arrest a ""wanted terrorist"".

Israel-Hamas fighting closes in on south Gaza city,"GAZA - Israeli forces on Wednesday battled Hamas militants in Gaza's main southern city, leading to ""deepening horror"" for civilians, the UN said, after nearly two months of war sparked by deadly attacks on Israel.
Israeli troops, tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers have rolled into Khan Yunis, Gaza's second-largest city, forcing already displaced civilians to flee again, witnesses told AFP.
The military wing of Hamas reported fighting with Israeli forces east of the southern city.
""We are devastated,"" said local resident Amal Mahdi who survived an overnight Israeli strike on Khan Yunis. ""We need someone to find us a solution so we can get out of this situation.""
Much of northern Gaza has already been reduced to rubble by fierce fighting and bombardment, displacing 1.9 million people according to UN figures.With Israel now focusing on the south, the streets of Khan Yunis were almost empty early Wednesday as residents sought shelter from shelling and artillery fire, AFP journalists reported, while the dead and wounded continued to pour into the city's hospitals.
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group's October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities, and saw around 240 hostages taken.
The latest toll from the Hamas government's media office said 16,248 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, had been killed.
""We, too, want this war to end,"" Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told reporters, ""But it can only end in a way that ensures that Hamas can never attack our people again.""
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and free 138 hostages still held in Gaza after scores were released during a short-lived truce.But mass casualties in Gaza have sparked global concern, heightened by dire shortages caused by an Israeli siege that has seen only limited supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines enter.
""The entire north of the Gaza Strip is left without health services,"" said Munir al-Bursh, director of the Hamas-run health ministry.
With mediation efforts seemingly stalled since the collapse of a truce on Friday, the UN human rights chief pleaded for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages.
""Palestinians in Gaza are living in utter, deepening horror,"" Volker Turk told a news conference.
""Civilians in Gaza continue to be relentlessly bombarded by Israel and collectively punished... I call for an urgent cessation of hostilities,"" he said.
 
- 'Relentless shelling' -
 
The Israeli army said Wednesday it had struck about 250 targets in Gaza over the past 24 hours and that troops had found a major arms depot ""in the heart of a civilian population"".
""One of the largest weapons depots in the Gaza Strip was found near a clinic and school"" in an undisclosed location in northern Gaza, it said.
""The depot contained hundreds of RPG missiles and launchers of various types, dozens of anti-tank missiles,"" explosives and drones, the statement added.Sources in Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group, told AFP their fighters were battling Israeli troops early Wednesday in a bid to prevent them from breaking into Khan Yunis.
The Hamas media office said dozens were killed and injured in heavy strikes east of the city.
Many civilians fled to Khan Yunis when Israel ordered them to evacuate the north of the densely populated Gaza Strip earlier in the offensive.
Hassan al-Qadi, a Khan Yunis resident displaced to Rafah, said ""the whole city is suffering from destruction and relentless shelling.""
""Many are homeless and some are searching for their missing children,"" he said.International aid groups have condemned the succession of orders to flee from one area to another, saying civilians were running out of options.
Israel's army has published a map it said was intended to enable Gazans to ""evacuate from specific places for their safety if required"".
But the UN children's agency, UNICEF, said it was ""not possible"" to create safe zones in a tiny territory with some 2.4 million people.
 
- 'Justice' on sexual violence -
 The UN has faced criticism over its alleged lacklustre response to reports of sexual violence by Hamas during the October 7 attack, which the Palestinian group has dismissed as ""unfounded lies"".
Its rights chief, Turk, voiced deep concern on Wednesday over the reports, saying ""these are very, very serious allegations and they need to be investigated, they need to be properly documented.""
""Justice must be served for the victims,"" he added.
UNICEF head Catherine Russell said ""survivors must be heard, supported, and provided with care. Allegations must be fully investigated.""
Fighting resumed after the collapse on Friday of a Qatar-mediated truce that saw scores of Israeli and other hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
The war has sparked fears of a wider regional conflict, with near-daily exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah across Israel's border with Lebanon and a surge of deadly violence in the occupied West Bank.In the West Bank, Israeli troops raided the northern Faraa refugee camp early Wednesday, sparking clashes that killed two people, one of them aged 16, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
Palestinian authorities say more than 250 Palestinians have been killed during the current conflict by Israeli fire or settler attacks in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967.

By Adel Zaanoun With Stuart White In Jerusalem",Wednesday 06 December 2023 - 11:30am
Gaza war rages on 100th day,"GAZA CITY - The Israel-Hamas war reached a grim milestone of 100 days on Sunday, with more civilian deaths in Gaza, and relatives of dozens of hostages still awaiting their freedom.
There were also casualties in the West Bank, and on the Israel-Lebanon border.
The conflict, sparked by unprecedented attacks on Israel, has created a humanitarian catastrophe for the 2.4 million people in Hamas-ruled Gaza, the United Nations and aid groups warn, and reduced much of the coastal strip to rubble.
The UN says roughly 85 percent of the territory's population have been displaced -- crowded into shelters and struggling to get food, water, fuel and medical care.""It's been 100 days and our situation is very bad,"" said Mohammad Kahil, displaced to Rafah, in southern Gaza near Egypt, from the territory's north.
""There's no food, no water, no heating. We are dying from the cold.""
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said diseases were spreading with ""the clock ticking fast towards famine"".
Violence involving Iran-aligned groups in Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria has surged since the war in Gaza began in early October.While a wider conflagration has so far been averted, fears increased following US and British strikes on scores of Yemeni rebel targets Friday.
Undeterred, the Huthis have vowed more attacks in solidarity with Gaza against what they deem Israeli-linked Red Sea shipping.
The Hamas government media office said Sunday that ""more than 100 people were martyred in the attacks last night until 6:00 am in all areas of the Gaza Strip"".
Among those killed was Yazan al-Zwaidi, a video-journalist for Cairo-based Al Ghad television, ""murdered by Israeli fire"", the station said on X, formerly Twitter.
- More civilians killed -
At central Gaza's Al-Aqsa hospital, the bodies arrived piled on a donkey cart after Israeli strikes that Hisham Abu Suweh said killed one of his children.
As civilians, Suweh said his family had thought they would be safe.""We're shocked by what happened,"" he said outside the emergency ward where his wife was being treated. ""We were sitting peacefully when the missile hit us.""
Fewer than half of Gaza's hospitals are even partly functioning, the World Health Organization says.
The war began when Gaza-based Hamas attacked on October 7, resulting in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Iran-backed Hamas is considered a ""terrorist"" group by the United States and the European Union.The militants also seized about 250 hostages, 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched a relentless military campaign that has killed at least 23,968 people in the Palestinian territory, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
On the Israel-Lebanon border, which has seen regular exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Hamas ally Hezbollah, the Israeli army said it killed three gunmen who had crossed the frontier and ""fired at the forces"".
The army said warplanes also hit Hezbollah positions after a missile strike on a house in an Israeli border community. The missile killed a woman and her son, local authorities said.
- PM under pressure -
""What has the enemy achieved in 100 days, other than killing?"" asked Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in a televised speech.
Israel's military has said its forces have dismantled the Hamas command structure in Gaza's north.
On Sunday the military said it had struck rocket launching pits in Gaza's north and hit targets across the strip, including the main southern city of Khan Yunis.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a government budget meeting on Sunday that additional security expenditures were needed.
""We must conduct this war, and it will yet take many months,"" he said.
Netanyahu is under intense domestic pressure to account for political and security failings surrounding the initial attack, and to bring the hostages home. He is also on trial for corruption charges, which he denies.
- Hostages 'in tunnels, in basements' -
On a cold and rainy Sunday in Tel Aviv, Israelis danced, sang and prayed at a series of events to mark the 100 days of captivity for the Gaza hostages.
""I don't think we imagined a situation where we would be here on the 100th day,"" said Gili Dvash Yeshurun, who attended the commemoration.Israel's trade union federation, the Histadrut, said hundreds of thousands of workers joined a 100-minute strike.
US President Joe Biden also acknowledged ""a devastating and tragic milestone"" for the hostages.
""No one should have to endure even one day of what they have gone through, much less 100,"" he said, adding the United States would ""never stop working to bring Americans home"".
Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said many of the hostages are likely to have been killed recently.
""The enemy's leadership and army bear full responsibility,"" he said in a televised statement.
Hamas on Sunday also released video footage it claimed showed three hostages alive in its custody in Gaza.
In the video, one woman and two men appear talking in Hebrew calling on the Israeli authorities to act for their return home. It was unclear when the footage was filmed.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed earlier Sunday: ""We will not let the world forget. We will not leave them behind.""Troops also detained two sisters of Saleh al-Aruri, Hamas's deputy leader killed in a strike in Beirut this month, Palestinian sources and the Israeli army said.
A US defence official has said Israel carried out that strike, which stoked fears of a wider war.
In Egypt, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged the establishment of a Palestinian state and a ceasefire in Gaza.
- by Adel Zaanoun with Jay Deshmukh in Jerusalem",Monday 15 January 2024 - 09:00am
Hunger grips war-torn Gaza as truce talks resume in Cairo,"Heavy fighting rocked besieged Gaza on Wednesday as aid agencies warned of looming famine, a day after a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire was blocked by a US veto.
Washington, which argued the resolution would have imperilled ongoing efforts to free hostages, sent top White House official Brett McGurk to Cairo for renewed talks involving mediators and Hamas.
Global concern has spiralled over the high civilian death toll and dire humanitarian crisis in the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack against Israel.
Combat and chaos again stalled the sporadic aid deliveries for desperate civilians in Gaza, where the UN has warned the population of 2.4 million is on the brink of famine and could face an ""explosion"" of child deaths.The UN World Food Programme said it was forced to halt aid deliveries in north Gaza because of ""complete chaos and violence"" after a truck convoy encountered gunfire and was ransacked by looters.
More Israeli strikes pounded Gaza, leaving 103 people dead during the night, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, which put the overall death toll at 29,313.
""We can't take it anymore,"" said Ahmad, a resident of Gaza City, where entire blocks are in ruins and cratered streets are strewn with rubble. 
""We do not have flour, we don't even know where to go in this cold weather,"" he said. ""We demand a ceasefire. We want to live.""
Particular concern has centred on Gaza's far-southern Rafah area, where 1.4 million people now live in crowded shelters and makeshift tents, fearing attack by nearby Israeli ground troops.
Aid groups warn a ground offensive could turn Rafah into a ""graveyard"" and the United States has said the vast numbers of displaced civilians must first be moved out of harm's way.US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that ""without properly accounting for the safety and security of those refugees, we continue to believe that an operation in Rafah would be a disaster"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted the army will keep fighting until it has destroyed Hamas and freed the remaining 130 hostages, around 30 of whom are feared dead.
War cabinet minister Benny Gantz has warned that, unless Hamas releases the captives by the start of Ramadan around March 10, the army will keep fighting during the Muslim holy month, including in Rafah.
 
- 'More massacres' -
 The war started when Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli figures.
Hamas also took about 250 hostages, many of whom were released during a week-long truce in late November.
Israel has heavily bombed Gaza and launched a ground invasion that has seen troops and tanks push through from the north towards the south, leaving vast swathes entirely destroyed. 
The World Health Organization called the devastation ""indescribable"" around Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis, where it said it managed to evacuate some 32 patients.
""The area was surrounded by burnt and destroyed buildings, heavy layers of debris, with no stretch of intact road,"" WHO said. The clinic has no power or running water, it added, and ""medical waste and garbage are creating a breeding ground for disease"".
Major powers have tried to navigate a way out of the crisis, so far without success.
On Tuesday the UN Security Council voted on an Algeria-drafted resolution which demanded an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the release of all hostages.
The United States vetoed the resolution, which it labelled ""wishful and irresponsible"", drawing strong criticism from China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and even close ally France.
Hamas said the US veto amounted to ""a green light for the occupation to commit more massacres"".
 
- US envoy in Cairo -
 Washington sent McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, to Egypt as part of efforts to advance a hostage deal, before he heads to Israel Thursday.
Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was already in Cairo for talks, the militant group said -- days after mediators warned that prospects for a truce had dimmed despite repeated talks.
Qatar and Egypt have proposed a plan to free hostages in return for a pause in fighting and the release of Palestinian prisoners, but Israel and Hamas have so far failed to agree on a deal.
McGurk will hold talks ""to see if we can't get this hostage deal in place,"" Kirby told reporters.As the bloodiest ever Gaza war has continued into a fifth month, Israel has faced a growing international chorus of criticism.
Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused Israel of ""genocide"" after Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had compared the Gaza campaign to the Holocaust. 
The war has set off clashes elsewhere in the Middle East, drawing in Iran-backed armed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
Israel has traded almost daily cross-border fire with Lebanon's Hezbollah, and US and British forces have hit Yemen's Huthi rebels to deter their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.Violence has also flared in the occupied West Bank where the Israeli army said its troops killed three Palestinian militants during an overnight raid in the northern city of Jenin.",Wednesday 21 February 2024 - 13:00pm
Netanyahu promises 'safe passage' to Palestinians ahead of Rafah operation,"JERUSALEM - The threat of an Israeli incursion into Gaza's southernmost town of Rafah persisted Sunday, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised ""safe passage"" to civilians displaced there.
In an interview airing Sunday, Netanyahu reiterated his intention to extend Israel's military operation against Hamas into Rafah.
Despite international alarm over the potential for carnage in a place crammed with more than half of the Gaza Strip's 2.4 million people, Netanyahu told ABC News: ""We're going to do it"".
""We're going to do it while providing safe passage for the civilian population so they can leave,"" he said, according to published extracts of the interview.
It remains unclear however, where the large number of people pressed up against the border with Egypt and sheltering in makeshift tents can go.  
When asked, Netanyahu would only say they are ""working out a detailed plan"".
As Israeli forces have pushed steadily southwards, Rafah has become the last major population centre in Gaza that troops have yet to enter, even as it is bombarded by air strikes almost daily. 
""They said Rafah is safe, but it is not. All places are being targeted,"" Palestinian Mohammed Saydam said after an Israeli strike destroyed a police vehicle in the city on Saturday. The Israeli premier, who contends ""victory"" over Hamas cannot be achieved without clearing battalions in Rafah, directed his military on Friday to prepare for the operation. His announcement set off a chorus of concern from world leaders and aid groups. 
""The people in Gaza cannot disappear into thin air,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wrote on social media platform X, adding that an Israeli offensive on Rafah would be a ""humanitarian catastrophe in the making."" 
Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry warned Saturday of ""very serious repercussions of storming and targeting"" Rafah and called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting, while UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said he is ""deeply concerned"" about the prospective offensive. 
""The priority must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out,"" he wrote.
 
- Sharpening US rebuke -
 
The war in Gaza was sparked by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Vowing to eliminate Hamas, Israel launched a massive military offensive in Gaza that the territory's health ministry says has killed at least 28,064 people, mostly women and children.Militants also seized 250 hostages, 132 of whom are still in Gaza, although 29 are presumed dead, Israel has said.
Netanyahu announced the plan for a ground operation in Rafah only days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Israel seeking a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange.
Netanyahu has rejected the proposed truce after what he called ""bizarre demands"" from Hamas.
But Israel's plans for Rafah have drawn sharp rebuke from main ally and military backer Washington, with the State Department warning that if not properly planned, such an operation risks ""disaster"".In unusually sharp criticism, US President Joe Biden on Thursday called Israel's retaliatory campaign ""over the top"".
Gaza's Hamas rulers warned on Saturday that a full-scale Israeli invasion of Rafah could cause ""tens of thousands"" of casualties.
The office of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said the move ""threatens security and peace in the region and the world"" and is ""a blatant violation of all red lines"".
The Hamas-run territory's health ministry said on Sunday that 94 people were killed in overnight bombardments across Gaza, including in Rafah.
The Israeli military said it killed two ""senior Hamas operatives"" in a strike on Rafah Saturday.
It was part of a wider bombardment that killed at least 25 people in the city, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
 
- UNRWA under pressure -
 
To the north in Gaza City, Israel's military claimed that its troops uncovered a Hamas tunnel under the evacuated headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called for its head, Philippe Lazzarini, to quit.
Lazzarini said the agency had not operated from the compound since October 12 when staff evacuated it under instruction from Israeli forces.Already under pressure after Israel claimed 12 UNRWA staff were involved in the October 7 Hamas attack, he called for an independent investigation into the latest Israeli accusations.
An AFP photographer was among a number of journalists taken to the compound and tunnel by the Israeli military on Thursday.
UN premises are considered ""inviolable"" in international law and immune from ""search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation and any other form of interference"".
Hamas has repeatedly denied Israeli accusations that it has dug a network of tunnels under schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure as cover for its activities.
On Sunday, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy called UNRWA ""a Hamas front"".
 
- Public fury -
 
The war, now in its fifth month, has spawned intensifying public fury in Israel.
Protesters took to the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday night to demand the release of the hostages, Netanyahu step down and fresh elections be called. 
""It's clear Netanyahu is dragging out the war, he has no idea what to do on the day after,"" Israeli protester Gil Gordon said.A senior Hamas officer survived an Israeli assassination attempt in Lebanon, Palestinian and Lebanese security sources told AFP, but two other people including a Hezbollah member were killed in the attack.
And in Syria, Israeli strikes near Damascus killed three people, a war monitor said, adding the targeted neighbourhood hosted villas for top military and civilian officials.

First relief convoy enters Gaza devastated by 'nightmare' war,"GAZA - The first aid trucks arrived in war-torn Gaza from Egypt on Saturday, bringing urgent humanitarian relief to the Hamas-controlled Palestinian enclave suffering what the UN chief labelled a ""godawful nightmare"".
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the Islamist militant group carried out the deadliest attack in the country's history on October 7.
Hamas militants killed at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians who were shot, mutilated or burnt to death, and took more than 200 hostages, according to Israeli officials.An Israeli siege has cut food, water, electricity and fuel supplies to the densely populated and long-blockaded territory of 2.4 million people, sparking fears of a humanitarian catastrophe.
AFP journalists on Saturday saw 20 trucks from the Egyptian Red Crescent, which is responsible for delivering aid from various UN agencies, pass through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt into Gaza.
The crossing -- the only one into Gaza not controlled by Israel -- closed again after the trucks passed.The lorries had been waiting for days on the Egyptian side after Israel agreed to a request from its main ally the United States to allow aid to enter.
UN chief Antonio Guterres said the 20 trucks admitted so far fell far short of the needs of Gazans, more than one million of whom have been forced from their homes.
""Much more"" aid needs to be sent, Guterres told a peace summit in Egypt on Saturday.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the aid and urged ""all parties"" to keep the Rafah crossing open.
But a Hamas spokesman said ""even dozens"" of such convoys could not meet Gaza's requirements, especially as no fuel was being allowed in to help distribute the supplies to those in need.
 
- 'Reeling in pain' -
 
Tens of thousands of Israeli troops have deployed to the Gaza border ahead of an expected ground offensive that officials have pledged will begin ""soon"".As international tensions soar, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was hosting a peace summit in Cairo on Saturday attended by regional and some Western leaders.
""The time has come for action to end this godawful nightmare,"" Guterres told the summit, calling for a ""humanitarian ceasefire"".
The region ""is reeling in pain and one step from the precipice"", he said.
Guterres said ""the grievances of the Palestinian people are legitimate and long"" after ""56 years of occupation with no end in sight"".
But he stressed that ""nothing can justify the reprehensible assault by Hamas that terrorised Israeli civilians"". 
""Those abhorrent attacks can never justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,"" he added.According to Arab diplomats who spoke with AFP on condition of anonymity, the meeting broke up without a joint statement, highlighting the gulf between Arab and Western countries on how best to bring lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
Western delegates demanded ""a clear condemnation placing responsibility for the escalation on Hamas"" but Arab leaders refused, the diplomats said.
Instead the Egyptian hosts released a statement -- drafted with the approval of Arab delegates -- criticising world leaders for seeking to ""manage the conflict and not end it permanently"".
The statement said such ""temporary solutions and palliatives... do not live up to even the lowest aspirations"" of the Palestinian people.
 
- 'Sliver of hope' -
 
A full-blown Israeli ground offensive of Gaza carries many risks, including to the hostages Hamas took and whose fate is shrouded in uncertainty.So the release of two Americans among the hostages -- mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan -- offered a rare ""sliver of hope"", said Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
US President Joe Biden thanked Qatar, which hosts Hamas's political bureau, for its mediation in securing the release.
He said he was working ""around the clock"" to win the return of other Americans being held.
Natalie Raanan's half-brother Ben told the BBC he felt an ""overwhelming sense of joy"" at the release after ""the most horrible of ordeals"".Traumatised families with loved ones missing in Gaza demanded more action.
""We ask humanity to interfere and bring back all those young boys, young girls, mothers, babies,"" Assaf Shem Tov, whose nephew was abducted from a music festival where Hamas killed hundreds, said Friday.
 
- Devastation -
 
Almost half of Gaza's residents have been displaced, and at least 30 percent of all housing in the territory has been destroyed or damaged, the United Nations says.Thousands have taken refuge in a camp set up in the city of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.
Fadwa al-Najjar said she and her seven children walked for 10 hours to reach the camp, at some points breaking into a run as missiles struck around them.
""We saw bodies and limbs torn off and we just started praying, thinking we were going to die,"" she told AFP.
In Al-Zahra in central Gaza, Rami Abu Wazna was struggling to take in the destruction wreaked by Israeli missile strikes.
""Even in my worst nightmares, I never thought this could be possible,"" he said.
 
- Regional tensions flare -
 
The United States has moved two aircraft carriers into the eastern Mediterranean to deter Iran or Lebanon's Hezbollah, both Hamas allies, amid fears of a wider conflagration.Exchanges of fire continued across Israel's border with Lebanon Friday, with Hezbollah reporting one of its fighters had been killed. In Israel, two Thai farm workers were wounded, emergency services said.
Hezbollah number two Naim Qassem warned: ""If something comes up that calls for greater intervention by us, we will do so.""
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant retorted: ""Hezbollah has decided to participate in the fighting, and is paying a price for it.""
Violence has also flared in the West Bank, where 84 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, according to the Palestinian health ministry.

"80 years after WWII, Holocaust survivor escapes Hamas attack","PARIS - Yaakov Weissmann survived the horrors of the Holocaust by hiding with a non-Jewish family in France when he was just four years old during World War II.
Now 83, he survived the October 7 attack in Israel by Hamas gunmen that has drawn comparisons to Nazi atrocities for its brutality.
Weissmann's village Netiv Haassara is just 500 metres (1,600 feet) from the border with the Gaza Strip, from where Hamas Islamists under the cover of a hail of missiles, stormed into Israel, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
Israel has declared war on Hamas, pounding Gaza incessantly since with air strikes that the densely populated enclave's authorities said killed 2,750 people, most of them ordinary Palestinians.
Weissmann heard rockets go off at around 6:00 am that Saturday, which was also the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest. 
""Rockets, rockets and booms. Well it's not the first time,"" said Weissmann, whose village of 800 inhabitants is used to projectiles aimed by armed Palestinian groups at Israel.
Pistol in hand, he and his wife followed the drill to get into his fortified shelter -- something that every home in the area is equipped with, securing the door and window within 15 seconds.
""Then I heard, with my wife, we heard machine gun fire. When we heard this, we know there has been an infiltration of enemy forces,"" he said.
A deep sadness came over him, he said, ""because as soon as there is gunfire, I know there are deaths"".
When he came out of the shelter, he found to his great relief that all 23 of his descendants -- children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren -- who live in the village were alive.
 
- Anger -
 
Twenty people in Netiv Haassara were killed, including many whom Weissmann knew personally. Five of them died with weapons in their hands. They were security volunteers, said Weissmann, who believes they had helped to prevent further bloodshed.
As the day went on, the scale and the horror of the attack became clear. 
In the worst-hit villages, entire families, including babies, were killed in their homes, some of which were also set on fire.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the attacks were ""savagery never seen since the Holocaust"".
US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin said the Hamas fighters took ""evil to another level"" from Islamic State jihadists.
Ten days on, Weissmann said the overwhelming emotion for him beyond sadness is ""anger, because, how did our famous army get caught off guard?""
Born in France in 1940, Weissmann said the attack had revived memories of his childhood hiding from the Nazis. 
His Polish parents fled pogroms to move to France in 1933 but his father was arrested by Nazi-allied French militia in 1944.
He was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, were killed.
A non-Jewish family took him and his sister in a village near the southeastern city of Lyon, pretending they were their nephew and niece on a visit. 
After the war, Weissmann moved to Israel, where he first lived close to the Jordanian border before resettling in Netiv Haassara, a farming village in the Sinai Peninsula after it was seized by Israel from Egypt during the 1967 six-day war. 
But the village was evacuated in 1982 under the framework of a peace deal which returned control of the peninsula to Egypt.
It was then displaced to its current location close to the Gaza Strip, conserving its name.
 
- 'Eradicate them' -
 
At 83, Weissmann has been displaced again -- this time to a retirement home in central Israel's Modiin. Inhabitants of villages close to Gaza have mostly vacated their homes in recent days as Israeli troops massed in preparation for a ground invasion. 
""I don't want revenge, but I want the people responsible to pay,"" said Weissmann, adding that for him, ""not only is Hamas at fault, but those Gaza"" who ""jumped in joy and distributed sweets"" when the gunmen were carrying out their attack.
His greatest revenge against the Nazis was simply having stayed alive and built a family.
""You wanted to exterminate us, well, I had children and grandchildren and we keep on living,"" he said, adding that he uses the compensation Germany pays him as a Holocaust survivor to take the family on vacation.
What he wants for Hamas is to ""eradicate them from the map"".
Israel's vow to ""destroy"" Hamas must be met, he said, adding: ""Then I will calm down.""
After that, he says without hesitation that he plans to return to Netiv Haassara. 
""But I can understand that my daughters may not want that,"" he conceded.

"Israel, Hamas truce and hostage release delayed","Israel said a four-day Gaza truce and hostage release will not start until at least Friday, stalling a breakthrough deal to pause the war with Hamas.
Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi indicated the release of at least 50 Israeli and foreign hostages held by Hamas was on track, but would not happen on Thursday as expected.
""The contacts on the release of our hostages are advancing and continuing constantly,"" he said in a statement.
""The start of the release will take place according to the original agreement between the sides, and not before Friday.""
A second Israeli official said that a temporary halt in fighting would also not begin on Thursday.
The delay is a hammer blow to families desperate to see their loved ones return home, and to two million-plus Gazans praying for an end to 47 days of war and deprivation.
The complex and carefully choreographed deal saw Israel and Hamas agree a four-day truce, during which at least 50 hostages taken in the Palestinian militant group's deadly October 7 attacks would be released.
For every 10 additional hostages released, there would be an extra day's ""pause"" in fighting, an Israeli government document said.
Three Americans, including three-year-old Abigail Mor Idan, were among those earmarked for release.
In turn, Israel would release at least 150 Palestinian women and children and allow more humanitarian aid into the besieged coastal territory after weeks of bombardment and heavy fighting.
It was not immediately clear what caused the delay in the deal that resulted from weeks of talks involving Qatar, Egypt and the United States. 
 
- 'We are winning' -
 
The agreement has been approved by Hamas leaders and by Israel -- despite fierce opposition from some within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government.
Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir described the deal as a ""historic mistake"" that would embolden Hamas and risk the lives of Israeli troops. 
Around 240 hostages were taken by Hamas and other Palestinian gunmen during bloody raids into Israel on October 7, which also killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
The shock attack prompted a blistering Israeli offensive into Hamas-run Gaza, which authorities there say has killed more than 14,000 people, thousands of them children.
Netanyahu has backed the agreement with Hamas, but vowed the truce will be temporary and will not end the campaign to destroy Hamas.""We are winning and will continue to fight until absolute victory,"" he said on Wednesday, vowing to secure Israel from threats emanating from Gaza and Lebanon, home to Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants.
Tensions rose on Israel's northern border early Thursday, after Hezbollah said five fighters, including the son of a senior lawmaker, had been killed.
Since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, the frontier between Lebanon and Israel has seen almost daily exchanges of fire, raising fears the Gaza war fuel a regionwide conflagration.
Israel's army said in statements Wednesday evening that it had struck a number of Hezbollah targets, including a ""terrorist cell"" and infrastructure.The White House has pressed Israel not to escalate clashes with Hezbollah, for fear of sparking a war that could drag in US and Iranian forces. 
Biden also spoke to the leaders of Qatar and Egypt Wednesday, as he pushed for the truce to be ""fully implemented"" and to ""ultimately secure the release of all hostages.""
In the Red Sea, US Central Command on Thursday said the USS Thomas Hudner had ""shot down multiple one-way attack drones launched from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen"" -- referencing another Iran-backed militia group.
 
- 'Pain in my heart' -
 Families on both sides grappled with a lack of clarity over how the releases would unfold.
""We don't know who will get out because Hamas will release the names every evening of those who will get out the next day,"" said Gilad Korngold, whose son and daughter-in-law are being held in Gaza along with their two children and other relatives.
Israel's list of eligible Palestinian prisoners included 123 detainees under 18 and 33 women, among them Shrouq Dwayyat, convicted of attempted murder in a 2015 knife attack.
""I had hoped that she would come out in a deal,"" her mother, Sameera Dwayyat, said, but added that her relief was tempered by ""great pain in my heart"" over the dead children in Gaza.
In Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, displaced Palestinians remained sceptical about the Israel-Hamas deal.
""What truce are they talking about? We don't need a truce just so aid can come in. We want to go home,"" said Maysara Assabagh, who fled northern Gaza for a hospital that now shelters about 35,000 displaced people.
Large parts of Gaza have been flattened by thousands of air strikes, and the territory faces shortages of food, water and fuel.For now, Israel appeared to be pushing on with its offensive in northern Gaza, with witnesses reporting strikes on Kamal Adwan hospital and nearby homes.

"Gaza in spotlight as Arab, Muslim blocs meet in Saudi","RIYADH - Arab leaders and Iran's president are in the Saudi capital Saturday for a summit meeting expected to underscore demands that fighting in Gaza end before the Israel-Hamas war draws in other countries.
READ: Palestinians say deadly strike hit Gaza hospital
The emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) comes after Hamas militants' bloody October 7 attacks that Israeli officials say left about 1,200 people dead and 239 taken hostage.
Israel's subsequent aerial and ground offensive has killed more than 11,000 people, also mostly civilians and many of them children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Aid groups have joined pleas for a ceasefire, warning of a humanitarian ""catastrophe"" in Gaza, where food, water and medicine are in short supply.
The Arab League and the OIC were originally meant to meet separately, but the Saudi foreign ministry announced early Saturday that the blocs' summits would be combined.
The move underscores the importance of reaching ""a unified collective position that expresses the common Arab and Islamic will regarding the dangerous and unprecedented developments witnessed in Gaza and the Palestinian territories,"" the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
The Arab League aims to demonstrate ""how the Arabs will move on the international scene to stop the aggression, support Palestine and its people, condemn the Israeli occupation, and hold it accountable for its crimes"", the bloc's assistant secretary-general, Hossam Zaki, said this week.
But Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad on Friday said it did not ""expect anything"" from the meeting, criticising Arab leaders for the delay. 
""We are not placing our hopes on such meetings, for we have seen their results over many years,"" Mohammad al-Hindi, the group's deputy secretary-general, told a press conference in Beirut.
""The fact that this conference will be held after 35 days (of war) is an indication of its outcomes.""
Israel and its main backer the United States have so far rebuffed demands for a ceasefire, a position that is expected to draw heavy criticism on Saturday.
""This is not just about Israel-Palestine -- this is about what is facilitating Israel to do this, which is basically the United States and the West,"" said Saudi analyst Aziz Alghashian.
That tension has been on display during US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent visits to the region, as well as during a stop this week in Riyadh by British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, who met with a number of his Arab counterparts who have called for a ceasefire.
""What we have said is that calling for a ceasefire is understandable, but what we also recognise is that Israel is taking action to secure its own stability and its own security,"" Cleverly said on Thursday.
 
- Raisi in Riyadh -
 Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi arrived in Riyadh on Saturday for the summit, his first Saudi trip since the two countries agreed to restore ties in March.
""The US has prevented the ceasefire in Gaza and is expanding the scope of the war,"" he said before departing from Tehran.
Raisi is the first Iranian president to visit Saudi Arabia since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attended an OIC meeting in the kingdom in 2012.
Iran backs Hamas as well as Lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Huthi rebels, placing it at the centre of concerns the war could expand.
The conflict has already fuelled cross-border exchanges between the Israeli army and Hezbollah, and the Huthis have claimed responsibility for ""ballistic missiles"" the rebels said targeted southern Israel.
Analysts say Saudi Arabia feels vulnerable to potential attacks because of its close ties with Washington and the fact that it was considering normalising ties with Israel before the war broke out.
Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Friday condemned ""continued violations of international humanitarian law by the Israeli occupation forces,"" his first public comments on the war, though Riyadh has levelled similar criticism in multiple statements.
Kim Ghattas, author of a book on the Iran-Saudi rivalry, said during a panel organised by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington that ""the Saudis are hoping that the fact they didn't normalise yet, and the fact that they have a channel to the Iranians, gives them some protection.""
And, she added, ""the Iranians are hoping that the fact that they're in touch with the Saudis and maintaining that channel, that it gives them some protection too.""

Hamas frees hostages as Gaza truce takes hold,"GAZA - Hamas on Friday freed a first batch of hostages seized in the deadliest attack in Israel's history under a deal that saw a temporary truce take hold in war-ravaged Gaza.
Thirteen Israeli hostages captured during 7 October cross-border raids were handed over to their country's security forces, an Israeli security source said.
It came after Hamas sources told AFP the hostages had been transferred to the Red Cross to be taken to the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. AFPTV live footage showed Red Cross jeeps entering the crossing with passengers on board, some of them waving.
The first group of women and child hostages were set to return to Israel under a deal that followed weeks of talks involving Israel, Palestinian militant groups, Qatar, Egypt and the United States.
Israel is set to release three times as many Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails -- women and teenage boys.Key mediator Qatar confirmed Hamas had on Friday released a total of 24 hostages and that Israel had freed 39 women and children from its prisons.
""Those released include 13 Israeli citizens, some of whom are dual citizens, in addition to 10 Thai citizens and a Filipino citizen,"" its foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari said.
A White House official said ""we do not expect Americans to be among the first group released today but remain hopeful that there will be Americans among the 50 released"".
Pictures released earlier by the Israeli army showed bright pink and blue headphones sitting on the seats of a helicopter ready for the released hostages to use, along with toys and teddy bears waiting at a reception centre where they were being taken to.In exchange, 150 Palestinians prisoners are expected to be released.
Hamas broke through Gaza's militarised border with Israel on 7 October, according to Israeli officials, about 1,200 people and seize around 240 Israeli and foreign hostages.
 
- 'Going home' -
 
The pause in fighting triggered a mass movement of thousands of Gazans who had sought refuge in schools and hospitals from relentless Israeli bombardment.""I'm going home,"" Omar Jibrin, 16, told AFP after he emerged from a hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip where he and eight family members had sought refuge.
In Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza where many Palestinians fled, a cacophony of car horns and ambulance sirens has replaced the sound of war.
For Khaled al-Halabi, the truce is ""a chance to breathe"" after nearly seven weeks of war.
Halabi had taken refuge in Rafah but is from Gaza City in the north, much of which has been reduced to rubble.
Israel's retaliatory air, artillery and naval strikes alongside a ground offensive have killed about 15,000 people, the Hamas government in Gaza said.
Gazans have struggled to survive with shortages of water and other essentials. Trucks carrying more aid, including fuel, gas, and food, began moving into Gaza from the Rafah crossing with Egypt shortly after the truce began at 7:00 am.Jens Laerke, spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian agency, OCHA, expressed hope in Geneva that the pause ""leads to a longer-term humanitarian ceasefire for the benefit of the people of Gaza, Israel and beyond.""
He repeated the need for access across Gaza, especially in the north ""where the damage and the humanitarian needs are the greatest"".
According to the UN, 1.7 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people are estimated to have been displaced by the fighting.
Now, thousands of them are trying to get home.
In Khan Yunis, they loaded belongings onto carts, strapped them to car roofs, or slung bags over their shoulders, crowding streets to return to their homes from temporary shelters.Israeli warplanes dropped leaflets warning people that the war is not over and it is ""very dangerous"" to return north, the focus of Israel's military campaign.
The truce was also a chance for some Palestinians to return to Gaza through the Rafah crossing.
In the morning, a few apparent gunshots could be heard and dark plumes of smoke rose periodically over northern Gaza, an AFPTV livecam showed, but the truce appeared to be holding in the afternoon.
 
- Carefully prepared -
 
Ziv Agmon, legal adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, told reporters the hostages would be received individually or in groups by the Red Cross, taken across the border and handed to the Israeli army.From El-Arish, in the Sinai, they would be flown to Israel, an Egyptian security source said.
Agmon said soldiers had been carefully prepared to receive potentially deeply traumatised women and children.
After medical examinations, the former captives will be able to telephone family members before reunions later at Israeli medical facilities, he added. 
AFP has confirmed the identities of 210 of the roughly 240 hostages.
At least 35 of those seized were children, with 18 of them aged 10 or under at the time.
Hamas earlier released four women and Israeli forces rescued another. Two other captives, including a woman soldier, were found dead by Israeli troops in Gaza.Maayan Zin, whose eight- and 15-year-old daughters Ela and Dafna are among the hostages, posted on social media platform X that she had been informed their names were not included.
""This is incredibly difficult for me; I long for their return,"" she wrote.

"Netanyahu rules out ceasefire, says no plans to occupy Gaza","WASHINGTON - Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out a ceasefire in Gaza on Thursday, saying the military was performing ""exceptionally well,"" but insisted Israel does not plan to reoccupy the Palestinian territory.
""A ceasefire with Hamas means surrender,"" he told Fox News, adding there was no ""timetable"" for the military offensive.
""I think the Israeli army is performing exceptionally well,"" he added.
""However long it takes, we'll do it.""
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the militant group poured across the border from Gaza on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians and taking around 240 people hostage, according to Israel.
READ: Tens of thousands flee as Israel tightens Gaza City 'stranglehold'
The retaliatory aerial bombing and ground offensive has killed more than 10,800 people in Gaza, mostly civilians and many of them children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Netanyahu said Israel has no plans to remain in Gaza longterm.
""We don't seek to govern Gaza. We don't seek to occupy it, but we seek to give it and us a better future,"" he said, adding that Israel does not ""seek to displace anyone.""
Pushed on his plan for Gaza's future, he said the impoverished and blockaded territory must be ""demilitarised, deradicalised and rebuilt.""

""We'll have to find a government, a civilian government that will be there,"" he added, without detailing who might form such a government.
And he said Israeli forces would have to remain ready to reenter Gaza and ""kill the killers"".
""That's what will prevent the reemergence of a Hamas-like entity.""
READ: Israel battles Hamas in Gaza City
The October 7 attack and subsequent conflict came as Israel moved closer to a peace deal with Saudi Arabia, building on the so-called Abraham accords that normalised ties with several Arab countries.
Netanyahu insisted the conflict would not torpedo diplomatic momentum and that conditions would be ""ripe"" for negotiations to resume after Israel destroys Hamas.
""I think conditions will be ripe. In fact, after a victory, I think they'll be even riper.""",Friday 10 November 2023 - 06:28am
First aid boat unloads in Gaza as Hamas proposes new truce,"A first aid ship plying a new maritime corridor from Cyprus began unloading its cargo of desperately needed food in Gaza Friday as Hamas proposed a new six-week truce in the war.
AFP footage showed the Open Arms, which set sail from Cyprus on Tuesday, towing a barge that the Spanish charity operating it says is loaded with 200 tonnes of food for Gazans threatened with famine after more than five months of war.
""World Central Kitchen is unloading the barge connected now to the jetty,"" said Linda Roth, a spokesperson for the US charity that is working with Open Arms.
The Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry said Israeli fire had earlier killed 20 people waiting to receive aid. Israel blamed ""armed Palestinians"" it said had opened fire on civilians.
The ministry said at least 149 people had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Witnesses reported air strikes and fighting in the southern Gaza Strip's main city Khan Yunis as well as areas of the north where humanitarian conditions have been particularly dire.
As Muslim worshippers marked the first Friday of the fasting month of Ramadan, AFP photographers saw Palestinians from the occupied West Bank queueing to pass through Israeli checkpoints to reach the revered Al-Aqsa mosque compound in annexed east Jerusalem.With tensions soaring over the Gaza war, Israel deployed thousands of police across Jerusalem's Old City.
In southern Gaza's Rafah, the last major population centre yet to be subjected to a ground assault but still pounded by Israeli strikes, AFPTV footage showed worshippers praying by the rubble of a destroyed mosque.
In negotiations aimed at securing a new truce and hostage deal, Hamas has put forward a new proposal for a six-week ceasefire and the exchange of several dozen Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, an official from the militant group told AFP. 
Hamas would want this to lead to ""a complete (Israeli) withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and a permanent ceasefire"", the official added.
The proposal would involve the release of some 42 hostages, who would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners at a ratio of between 20 and 50 prisoners per hostage, the official said, down from a previous proposal of a roughly 100-to-one ratio.
Palestinian militants seized about 250 Israeli and foreign hostages during the Hamas attack of October 7, dozens of whom were released during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes about 130 captives remain in Gaza including 32 presumed dead.
Israel said it was sending a delegation to Qatar for a new round of negotiations, a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of ""clinging to unacceptable demands"".
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was working ""intensively"" with its fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar ""to bridge the remaining gaps"".The United States, which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military assistance, has grown increasingly critical of Netanyahu over his handling of the war.
US Senate leader Chuck Schumer called for a snap Israeli election, describing Netanyahu as one of several ""major obstacles"" to peace in a speech praised by President Joe Biden.
""I think he expressed serious concern shared not only by him, but by many Americans,"" the president said.
Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party retorted that Israel was ""not a banana republic but an independent and proud democracy"".
 
- 'There is no bread' -
The United Nations has repeatedly warned of looming famine, with only a fraction of the supplies needed to sustain Gaza's 2.4 million people being let in.With fewer aid trucks entering by road, efforts have multiplied to get relief in by air and sea.
Cyprus, the nearest European Union member country to Gaza, has said a second, bigger vessel is being readied for the fledgling maritime air corridor after the Open Arms completes its mission.
""God willing, they will bring food for the children, that's all we ask for"", Abu Issa Ibrahim Filfil, a displaced Palestinian told AFPTV after spotting the ship from the beach.
Sea missions and airdrops are ""no alternative"" to the more effective land deliveries, 25 organisations including Amnesty International and Oxfam said in a statement this week.
Israel has accused some staff of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA -- the main aid organisation in Gaza -- of involvement in the October 7 attack. This led several donor governments to suspend support.Australia on Friday became the latest to resume funding after investigating the claims, with Foreign Minister Penny Wong saying: ""UNRWA is not a terrorist organisation"".
Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas, has killed at least 31,490 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry.
 
- 'Dying slowly' -Gaza's health ministry said Israeli troops opened fire from ""tanks and helicopters"" as Palestinians gathered at a roundabout in Gaza City in the north, killing 20 people and wounding dozens on Thursday.
Mohammed Ghurab, director of emergency services at a local hospital, told AFP there were ""direct shots by the occupation forces"" on people waiting for a food truck. 
An AFP journalist saw people who had been shot.
The Israeli military denied it had fired on the crowd. ""Armed Palestinians opened fire while Gazan civilians were awaiting the arrival of the aid convoy,"" and then ""continued to shoot as the crowd of Gazans began looting the trucks"", an army statement said.
Similar claims were made after a chaotic melee in the same area on February 29 in which more than 100 Gazans were killed, according to the health ministry.Samar Zari, a resident of Khan Yunis displaced with her family to Rafah, said the ""Gaza Strip is dying slowly. If not from the missiles, then from hunger. If not from hunger, then from dehydration.""",Friday 15 March 2024 - 19:25pm
"UN calls for ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"" in Gaza","WASHINGTON - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday alleged violations of international law in Gaza and urged an immediate ceasefire as Israel pounds the Palestinian territory in response to Hamas attacks, with the crisis deeply dividing the Security Council.
READ: Israel-Palestine Conflict | Ramaphosa reiterates call for dialogue
Israel voiced anger over the UN chief's plea before a high-level session of the Security Council, where the Palestinian foreign minister in turn denounced what he described as inaction in the conflict that has killed thousands on both sides, mostly civilians.
Opening the session, Guterres said there was no excuse for the ""appalling"" violence by Hamas militants on 7 October but also warned against ""collective punishment"" of the Palestinians.
""I am deeply concerned about the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza. Let me be clear: No party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law,"" Guterres told a Security Council session, without explicitly naming Israel.
Guterres said that the Palestinians had been ""subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation,"" telling the Security Council: ""It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum.""
His remarks infuriated Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen who, pointing his finger at Guterres and raising his voice, recounted graphic accounts of civilians killed on 7 October in the deadliest single attack in Israeli history.
""Mr Secretary-General, in what world do you live?"" Cohen said.
Pointing out that Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, Cohen said, ""We gave the Palestinians Gaza till the last millimeter. There is no dispute in regards to the land of Gaza.""
Israel shortly afterward imposed a blockade of the impoverished territory in place ever since after Hamas took power.
Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, called on Guterres to resign, writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the UN chief has ""expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder.""
 
- 'Epic suffering' -
 
Hamas militants stormed into Israel on 7 October and attacked largely civilian targets including families and a music festival, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 220 hostages, according to Israeli officials.
More than 5,700 Palestinians have been killed across the Gaza Strip in retaliatory Israeli bombardments, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry said.
Guterres, who personally traveled to the crossing between Egypt and Gaza in a push to let in assistance, welcomed the crossing of three aid convoys so far through the Rafah crossing.
""But it is a drop of aid in an ocean of need,"" Guterres said, warning that UN fuel supplies will run out within days.
""To ease epic suffering, make the delivery of aid easier and safer, and facilitate the release of hostages, I reiterate my appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.""
The Security Council session is bringing together top diplomats including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has previously rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying it would only allow Hamas to regroup.
The United States last week vetoed a draft resolution on the crisis, saying it did not sufficiently support Israel's right to self-defense.
Blinken told the Security Council that the United States was putting forward a new resolution that ""incorporates substantive feedback.""
He questioned why there was not more outrage over the killings of Israelis.
""We must affirm the right of any nation to defend itself and to prevent such harm from repeating itself. No member of this Council, no nation in this entire body, could or would tolerate the slaughter of its people,"" Blinken said.
The Palestinian Authority's foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki, a rival of Hamas, denounced inaction by the Security Council.
""The ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel -- the occupying power against the Palestinian civilian population under illegal occupation -- must be stopped,"" he said.
""It is our collective human duty to stop them,"" he said. ""Continued failure at this council is inexcusable.""

Fierce battles in Gaza after Jordan attack kills 3 US troops,"GAZA - Deadly fighting and air strikes rocked besieged Gaza on Monday, a day after an attack that killed three US troops in Jordan heightened fears of a wider regional conflict. 
Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip killed 140 people overnight, including 20 members of one family, said the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.
The Israeli army, in its war sparked by Hamas's 7 October attack, said its troops had ""encountered and killed dozens of armed terrorists in battles in central Gaza"".
Ground forces backed by tanks have focused combat operations on the coastal strip's main southern city of Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas's Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar.The almost four-month-old war was sparked by the Hamas attack which resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, in southern Israel, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Militants of Hamas, considered a ""terrorist"" group by the United States and European Union, also seized 250 hostages, of whom Israel says around 132 remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead captives.
Israel's relentless military offensive has since killed at least 26,422 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.
In the latest efforts to broker a new ceasefire, CIA chief William Burns met top Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials in Paris on Sunday, but no breakthrough was reported.US President Joe Biden sent Burns to try to negotiate the release of remaining hostages in exchange for a ceasefire, a security source has confirmed to AFP.
The New York Times reported Saturday that the negotiators were discussing a deal under which Israel would suspend the war for about two months in return for the release of over 100 hostages.
- Jordan attack kills 3 US troops -Since the outbreak of the Gaza war, Israel and its top ally the United States have faced attacks from, and struck back at, multiple Iran-backed armed groups with violence flaring in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
Lebanon's Hezbollah and Israel have traded near daily cross-border fire, and Yemen's Huthi rebels have launched attacks on Red Sea shipping, sparking US and British strikes on their bases.
US forces in Iraq and Syria have also been targeted more than 150 times, the Pentagon says. Most attacks were claimed by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-linked groups.
On Sunday, a drone attack on a remote base in Jordan, near the borders with Iraq and Syria, killed three US troops and wounded 25 others, the US military said.Biden blamed ""radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq"" and pledged to hold ""all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing"".
Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani labelled the accusations ""baseless"" and said Tehran ""does not welcome the expansion of conflict in the region"".
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri called the Jordan attack ""a message to the American administration"" and warned that ""the American-Zionist aggression on Gaza risks a regional explosion"".
- Bitter row over UN aid agency -The Gaza war has forced more than one million Palestinians to flee to the far-southern Rafah area near the Egyptian border, according to the UN, deepening the humanitarian crisis.
Hunger and disease have spread in crowded tent cities where families shelter in makeshift tents against the cold winter rain and mud while fearing more air strikes.
Alarm over their plight has heightened amid a bitter row over the main UN aid agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, after Israel charged several of its staff partook in the October 7 attack.
Japan became the latest major donor to freeze funding for the agency that has provided most food, medical and other aid to the 2.4 million people of long-blockaded Gaza.
UN chief Antonio Guterres has pleaded for continued financial support, saying ""the dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met"".
Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, warned that suspending funding ""overtly defies"" an International Court of Justice order to allow more aid into Gaza.Israel has argued the UN agency must play no role in post-war Gaza, and Israel's envoy to the UN, Gilad Erdan, charged that funding for it ""will be used for terrorism"".
Many Israelis, enraged by the October 7 attack, back the war effort by Netanyahu's government, the most religious and ultranationalist in Israel's 75-year history.
Hundreds of protesters have rallied at the Kerem Shalom border crossing in recent days and repeatedly blocked aid trucks from entering Gaza.
And thousands demonstrated Sunday to call for the re-establishment of Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, in a rally joined by several far-right ministers.
""If we don't want another October 7, we need to... control the territory,"" said National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.
Israel seized Gaza in 1967 before withdrawing its troops and settlers from the territory in 2005.
Netanyahu in official statements has rejected resettlement in Gaza, but the rally showed that the once-fringe position has gained momentum within his hard-right government.

Israel strikes Gaza's Rafah as truce talks under way,"TEL AVIV - Israel launched air strikes on southern Gaza's Rafah after threatening to send troops into the city, where around 1.4 million Palestinians have sought shelter from around the territory.
Global powers trying to navigate a way to end the Israel-Hamas war have so far come up short, but a US envoy was expected in Israel on Thursday to try to secure a truce deal.
International concern has spiralled over the high civilian death toll and dire humanitarian crisis in the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack against Israel.
More than four months of relentless fighting and air strikes have flattened much of the Hamas-run coastal territory, pushing its population of around 2.4 million to the brink of famine, according to the UN.
International concern has in recent weeks centred on Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, where more than 1.4 million people forced to flee their homes elsewhere in the territory are now living in crowded shelters and makeshift tents. 
The last city untouched by Israeli ground troops, Rafah also serves as the main entry point via neighbouring Egypt for desperately needed relief supplies.
Israel has warned it will expand its ground operations into Rafah if Hamas does not free the remaining hostages held in Gaza by next month's start of the Muslim holy month Ramadan.
War cabinet member Benny Gantz said Israel's operation in Rafah would begin ""after the evacuation of the population"", although his government has not offered any details on where civilians would be evacuated to.

'Living hell' in the ruins of Gaza's largest hospital,"GAZA - Hundreds of makeshift tents stand in a desolate landscape at the foot of Gaza City's ruined Al-Shifa hospital.
At least 30,000 people have taken refuge in its grounds between piles of rubble and waste after Israeli forces raided the medical facility last month, an AFP correspondent reported from the hospital.
Its medical equipment was heavily damaged and is now virtually unusable.
Food is scarce, too, but Gazans still come in search of what little safety a hospital -- supposedly protected under international law -- can afford as the shelling rumbles on.
AFP spoke to Gazans lacking everything from baby milk to tarpaulins for shelter from the rain and cold. 
Mohammed Daloul arrived at Al-Shifa ""with great difficulty"" and described shelling and shooting around the hospital.The 38-year-old, who fled with his wife and three children, said the artillery fire had not stopped for ""several days"".
He was unable to take anything from his house in the ruined Zeitoun district of Gaza City's old neighbourhood.
""Our life has become a living hell, there's no electricity, no water, no flour, no bread, no medicine for the children who are all sick,"" he told AFP. 
""All we can think about is survival"", he said.
- Hospital raid -
The largest hospital in bombed-out Gaza had already been under immense strain in the first stages of the war, with bodies piling up after food, fuel and anaesthetics ran out.
But it became a major focus of the Israeli ground offensive, with Israel claiming that Hamas was running a command centre below the facility despite repeated denials from hospital officials and the Palestinian militant group.
On November 15, Israeli troops sparked international outcry by launching a night-time raid on Al-Shifa.Several people, including the hospital director, were arrested and interrogated. 
Israel invited journalists to visit a tunnel it said it had found beneath the complex, but what it achieved in the raid remained unclear.
More than two months into the war, the fighting has killed at least 17,997 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Hamas triggered the conflict with deadliest-ever attack on Israel on October 7 in which it killed some 1,200 people and seized some 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials.
- 'Death will follow us' -
An estimated 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people -- about 80 percent of the population -- have been displaced, according to UN figures. Many are now in the south and running out of safe places to go.
Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are still believed to be in the heavily-bombed north.
On Saturday the Israeli army again told residents in the north to evacuate to safe areas -- but international organisations have condemned the lack of areas free from bombardment in the narrow coastal strip.
Hospitals have been hit repeatedly. On Sunday, Gaza's health ministry reported damage from a strike at the Jordanian field hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
Gazans are desperate. 
Souhail Abou Dhalfa said his family sought refuge at Al-Shifa after his 20-year-old son was wounded when their house was hit by relentless bombardment in Shejaiya, in the east of Gaza City.
""We put together a tent"", the 56-year-old said. ""We don't know if they will storm Al-Shifa again, and it doesn't matter -- wherever we go, death will follow us.""
Raed, who gave only his first name, has been sleeping on an old blanket under the stairs near the former emergency ward.
The 24-year-old's family of nine has no money for a tent, he said.

He was unable to take anything from his house in the ruined Zeitoun district of Gaza City's old neighbourhood.
""Our life has become a living hell, there's no electricity, no water, no flour, no bread, no medicine for the children who are all sick,"" he told AFP. 
""All we can think about is survival"", he said.
- Hospital raid -
The largest hospital in bombed-out Gaza had already been under immense strain in the first stages of the war, with bodies piling up after food, fuel and anaesthetics ran out.
But it became a major focus of the Israeli ground offensive, with Israel claiming that Hamas was running a command centre below the facility despite repeated denials from hospital officials and the Palestinian militant group.
On November 15, Israeli troops sparked international outcry by launching a night-time raid on Al-Shifa.Several people, including the hospital director, were arrested and interrogated. 
Israel invited journalists to visit a tunnel it said it had found beneath the complex, but what it achieved in the raid remained unclear.
More than two months into the war, the fighting has killed at least 17,997 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Hamas triggered the conflict with deadliest-ever attack on Israel on October 7 in which it killed some 1,200 people and seized some 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials.
- 'Death will follow us' -
An estimated 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people -- about 80 percent of the population -- have been displaced, according to UN figures. Many are now in the south and running out of safe places to go.
Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are still believed to be in the heavily-bombed north.
On Saturday the Israeli army again told residents in the north to evacuate to safe areas -- but international organisations have condemned the lack of areas free from bombardment in the narrow coastal strip.
Hospitals have been hit repeatedly. On Sunday, Gaza's health ministry reported damage from a strike at the Jordanian field hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
Gazans are desperate. 
Souhail Abou Dhalfa said his family sought refuge at Al-Shifa after his 20-year-old son was wounded when their house was hit by relentless bombardment in Shejaiya, in the east of Gaza City.
""We put together a tent"", the 56-year-old said. ""We don't know if they will storm Al-Shifa again, and it doesn't matter -- wherever we go, death will follow us.""
Raed, who gave only his first name, has been sleeping on an old blanket under the stairs near the former emergency ward.
The 24-year-old's family of nine has no money for a tent, he said.
His eight-year-old sister Manal sleeps with her head on a bundle of clothes. 
Beside her, their mother keeps watching over a bottle of water, some bread and cheese.",Sunday 10 December 2023 - 19:36pm
Aid ship sails to Gaza as Israel-Hamas war grinds on,"A Spanish charity ship taking food aid to Gaza left the Mediterranean island of Cyprus on Tuesday in hopes of opening a maritime corridor to the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.
The Open Arms set sail towing a barge loaded with 200 tonnes of relief goods for the sea journey of about 400 kilometres, as Cyprus said it was readying a second ship. 
""The departure of the first ship is a sign of hope,"" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen wrote on social media platform X. ""We will work hard together for many more ships to follow.""
Heavy Israeli bombardment again rained down on Gaza, killing at least 80 people overnight, and dozens more were missing under the rubble, said the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.The army said its forces were raiding targets across Gaza and had found ""AK-47 rifles, vests and explosive devices"" in a military compound in the main southern city of Khan Yunis.
The war since Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel has levelled vast parts of the coastal strip and sparked dire food shortages that have led the UN World Food Programme to warn ""famine is imminent"" in northern Gaza.
As the flow of aid trucks from Egypt has slowed -- a trend variously blamed on the war, the growing insecurity on the ground, and cumbersome Israeli inspections of cargo -- Western and Arab governments have stepped up daily airdrops.
However UN and other relief agencies warn that parachuting in aid parcels is less effective and falls far short of the hundreds of truckloads needed every day to sustain the population of 2.4 million people.The humanitarian crisis has gripped Gaza at a time Muslims have since Monday observed the month of Ramadan, where daytime fasts are traditionally broken with lavish evening iftar meals with family and friends.
In Gaza's southern city of Rafah -- now home to nearly 1.5 million people, many of whom have sought refuge in crowded shelters and makeshift tents -- one man, Mohammad al-Masry, said this year the family had just ""canned food and beans"".
Another displaced woman, Umm Muhammad Abu Matar from Khan Yunis, told AFP that this year, Ramadan has ""the taste of blood and misery"".
- Truce 'not near' -The militants also took around 250 hostages, dozens of whom were released during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes about 130 captives remain in Gaza, including 32 presumed dead.
The Israeli military said Tuesday a soldier believed to be held in Gaza, Itay Hen, 19, had been killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza.
US President Joe Biden expressed his condolences for the soldier, a dual Israeli-US national whose surname is also spelled Chen.
Israel's retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive have killed 31,184 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.Weeks of talks involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators failed to bring about a truce and hostage exchange deal ahead of Ramadan.
Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said that, although talks between the parties continued, ""we are not near a deal"".
Hamas has demanded a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, a demand labelled ""delusional"" by Israel, which accuses the group of seeking to stoke unrest during Ramadan.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed, despite growing international opposition, to push on with the war.
In an interview with Fox News, he doubled down on his plan to send troops into Rafah near the Egyptian border, the last area so far spared ground operations.
""We can't leave a quarter of the Hamas terror army in place, they're there in Rafah,"" the right-wing premier said, adding that ""it's either Israel or Hamas, there's no middle way"".
He said Israel agreed with the United States on the need to ""first enable the safe departure of the civilian population from Rafah before we go in"".
- Lebanon, Yemen violence -
The worst ever Gaza war, now in its sixth month, has stoked anger and protests worldwide, most of them against Israel.The Israeli army said Tuesday it had hit around 4,500 Hezbollah targets over the past five months in Lebanon and Syria, killing 300 fighters of the group and wounding more than 750.
The targets included ""weapons storage facilities, military structures intended for Hezbollah's offensive activity and operational command and control centres"".
New strikes on Tuesday on eastern Lebanon, far from the border, killed two people, Lebanese sources said, after Hezbollah said it had launched ""more than 100"" rockets at Israeli military positions.Yemen's Huthis have been attacking ships on the key Red Sea trade route leading towards the Suez Canal, in professed solidarity with the Palestinians, forcing many vessels to make the costlier journey around Africa.
US forces said Tuesday they had destroyed nearly 20 ballistic missiles and an underwater drone after the Huthis had fired two missiles, without causing casualties or damage, towards a merchant ship.
The Huthis said the attacks were ""in support of the oppressed Palestinian people"" and vowed that ""military operations will be escalated... during the month of Ramadan"".

"75 years after the Nakba, Palestinians still long for return","GAZA CITY - From her modest home in the blockaded Gaza Strip, Amina al-Dabai remembers the very different world in which she grew up more than seven decades ago.
Born in 1934, Dabai was still only a child when Israel was created on May 14, 1948.
Now she is one of 5.9 million Palestinian refugees living in the occupied West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria according to the United Nations.
They are descendants of more than 760,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes 75 years ago.
The event is known by Palestinians as the Nakba, or ""catastrophe"", during which more than 600 communities were destroyed or depopulated by Jewish forces, according to the Israeli organisation Zochrot.
The memory of the Nakba, which is commemorated on May 15, has become a rallying point for the Palestinian quest for statehood. 
It falls a day after Israel declared statehood in 1948, prompting an invasion by five Arab armies which the young nation defeated.
Ahead of the anniversary, AFP spoke to eight Palestinians in their 80s and 90s who were exiled during the Nakba to the Gaza Strip. 
 
- Soldiers in disguise -
 
Dabai recalled the day ""Jewish soldiers in disguise"" arrived in her hometown of Lydda, now known as Lod in central Israel.
Because the fighters' faces were covered in keffiyehs, a scarf that has come to symbolise the Palestinian struggle, locals thought they were reinforcements sent from Jordan.People were so delighted they ""rushed for the fountain"" in the town centre to celebrate.
But realising the soldiers were Jews, they ""fled into the mosque and their homes"".
""They (soldiers) stormed the mosque and killed everyone inside,"" she added. ""I was young and saw it with my own eyes.""
Planned deportation, expulsion or voluntary exile? A massacre of hundreds of civilians and unarmed fighters in a conflict where both sides were guilty of atrocities?
The events of July 12 to 13, 1948, during the capture of Lod by Israeli forces, remain the subject of debate and intense controversy even to this day.
One thing seems certain: the town was emptied of almost all of its 30,000 Arab residents practically overnight.
Following the war, the West Bank fell under Jordanian rule while Gaza was controlled by Egypt.
""We lived comfortably"" until that point, recalled Dabai, as she reminisced about children playing on swings, the central market, and the trickling of water from a large fountain surrounded by shops.
But she is bitter about what she lost: ""We were a weak country and we did not have powerful weapons.""The day after the disguised soldiers arrived, she said, they returned with orders -- leave Lod, or be killed.
""We said we don't want to leave. They said they would kill us. So all the poor people left, and we were among them,"" said Dabai.
The family fled on foot, walking for several days until they reached the Christian town of Bir Zeit, near Ramallah in the West Bank, then moving on towards Egypt.
But the journey was too expensive and so the family settled in Gaza instead.
Like many, they were sure they would be back soon.
Only after the Oslo Accords established the Palestinian Authority in the 1990s did Dabai manage to obtain a permit to visit her old neighbourhood in Lod.
""I put my hand on the wall of our house and said: 'my love, my grandfather's house, is destroyed, and our neighbours' homes are inhabited by Jews'"", she said.
She told AFP she would not accept any compensation for the home, and no longer expected to return, but insisted that ""future generations will liberate the country and return"".
""No one was filming the massacres and what was happening, in the way we do today,"" she added, her voice breaking.

- 'They surrounded the village' -

Umm Jaber Wishah was born in 1932 in the village of Beit Affa, near Ashkelon in what is now southern Israel.Decades later, with her greying hair covered by a white shawl, she painfully recounts how things were initially peaceful.
When Jews first came to the area of the village, ""they did not harm us and we didn't harm them,"" she told AFP from her home in the Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip.
""The Arabs worked for them (Jews) without problems, in safety,"" she added.
Yet the coexistence did not last long. She remembers the day in May 1948 that it shattered.
""I was baking bread, and they surrounded the village,"" she said, fighting back tears.
""They (Jewish soldiers) began besieging the village from the eastern side, and we hid from the shooting until the next day.""
""The men were tied up and were then taken prisoner, the children were screaming,"" she said.
According to Zochrot, Beit Affa was taken by Jewish forces the first time in July 1948 for a few days. During this period the residents in all likelihood left, ahead of the village's decisive capture later that year.
As in Palestinian refugee camps across the region, Bureij has long since traded temporary tents for more permanent structures of brick and wood. But many displaced still live in poverty.
Wishah, a wooden walking stick resting against her leg, said her Bureij home ""means nothing"".
""Even if they gave me the whole Gaza Strip in exchange for my homeland, I wouldn't accept it. My village is Beit Affa.""

- Rusty keys -

Ibtihaj Dola, from the coastal city of Jaffa, also remembers living side-by-side with Jews before Israel was established.
One of her relatives through marriage was Jewish and the city's large Jewish minority ""could speak Arabic"", said the 88-year-old.
Dola remembered returning home from school one day to find her family packing and preparing to flee.They boarded a boat for Egypt. She was still wearing her school uniform.
""I know Jaffa inch by inch,"" she said, fiddling with four rusty keys at her bedside in Gaza's Al-Shati refugee camp.
After the Oslo Accords she found an opportunity to return to Jaffa, where she discovered a Jewish woman was living in her house.
""We drank tea together and I started crying,"" she said, realising the woman was not interested in the fate of the previous owners.
Many of those who were displaced assumed it would just be temporary. They locked their front doors and took large metal keys with them.
Those keys today have become a symbol of their plight and their over-riding demand to return. In many homes, these keys are kept safely in a locked box under a bed, or memorialised in drawings and embroidery.
Israel claims Palestinians left voluntarily during the fighting and has repeatedly rejected claims its forces may have been responsible for war crimes.
It has steadfastly denied Palestinians the right to return -- often a sticking point in peace talks -- claiming it would be tantamount to a demographic surrender of the state's Jewish nature.
In 2011, after demonstrators marking Nakba day clashed with police, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the participants of ""questioning the very existence of Israel"".
Recognition of the Nakba is strongly rejected by Israelis, according to Zochrot which works to raise awareness of this period in history.
According to the organisation, Israelis ""are taught a false, greatly distorted but convincing narrative of 'a land without a people for a people without a land'.""

- 'Injustice does not last' -

Hassan al-Kilani, born in 1934 in Burayr village just north of the Gaza Strip, said he would only accept compensation if there was a political agreement.
""We, Arabs and Palestinians, cannot match the strength of Israel, let's be realistic,"" he said, wearing a crisp white headscarf.
""We resist, but our resistance is limited compared to our enemy,"" he added.
Kilani, a former construction worker, sketched a plan of Burayr, noting the name of each family, plot by plot.
The drawing now hangs on the wall of his living room, a constant reminder of the village where he grew up.
""Everyone who remained in the country was killed... even livestock, camels and cows,"" he said.
On another wall of the living room, a key is hung, symbolising the longed-for return.
""Injustice does not last,"" he added, but acknowledged, ""I am old. How many years do I have left to live?""

By Adel Zaanoun",Tuesday 02 May 2023 - 08:10am
No aid into Gaza as desperation mounts for millions trapped,"TEL AVIV - Israel said on Monday there was no temporary truce to allow aid in or foreigners out of the Gaza Strip, where desperation was mounting among millions of Palestinians trapped in the heavily bombarded enclave with little food or water.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to Israel Monday before a looming ground offensive to ""destroy"" the Hamas Islamist group that rules Gaza, and emphasised that ""civilians should not have to suffer for Hamas's atrocities"".
Israel declared war on Hamas a day after waves of its fighters broke through the heavily fortified border on October 7, shooting, stabbing and burning to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
Reeling from the deadliest attack in its history, Israel has unleashed a relentless bombing campaign of the Gaza Strip, flattening neighbourhoods and killing at least 2,750 people, mainly civilians.But with Israeli troops massed along the border, its calculations to invade Gaza where Hamas has built a warren of tunnels are complicated by the presence of 199 hostages captured by the Islamists.
The entire region was ""on the verge of the abyss"", warned UN chief Antonio Guterres, as cross-border fire also intensified between Israel and the Lebanese Iran-backed Hezbollah group, which has warned of retaliation if Israeli forces move into Gaza.
In Gaza, there were scenes of panic, anger and despair all around, as Palestinians heeded Israeli warnings to vacate the north before its major offensive.But the arrival of hundreds of thousands of people in the south was putting severe pressure on a place which had little resources to begin with and from where it is impossible to leave. 
""No electricity, no water, no internet. I feel like I'm losing my humanity,"" said Mona Abdel Hamid, 55, who fled Gaza City to Rafah in the south, where she is staying with strangers.
 
- Trapped -
 
With Israeli-controlled crossings closed and Egypt also having shut the Rafah border in the south, Gazans are effectively trapped.Any departure of Palestinians from Gaza is a sensitive issue, with Arab nations fearing that it could lead to permanent expulsion, something which Blinken has also categorically rejected.
Foreigners have flocked to Rafah in the hopes of being let out, after Blinken said he was confident the crossing ""will be open"" for aid into the strip.
Reports had suggested that Egypt was blocking the passage of Gazans with foreign passports until relief supplies are allowed in.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office dashed hopes of a deal, saying in a statement on Monday that ""there is currently no ceasefire and humanitarian aid in Gaza in return for removing foreigners"".
German national Ahmed Al Qasas, who has been waiting at the border three days for a chance to cross said ""people here are barely receiving water and food"".""In Gaza, in general, you can't say there is a safe zone for any person or for any animal or for even stones,"" said Danish national Etaf Al Rai, also waiting at Rafah in the hope of leaving. 
Lynn Hastings, the UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, accused Israel of linking humanitarian aid into Gaza with the release of hostages abducted by Hamas.
""Neither should be conditional,"" she insisted in a video posted by the UN.
""They have said they want to destroy Hamas, but their current trajectory is going to destroy Gaza.""
 
 
- 'Think twice' -
 
Harrowing testimonies from survivors of Hamas' attack and horrific scenes of devastation have bolstered an infuriated Israel's resolve to wipe out the group which it compared to the Islamic State.""I have seen babies, women and men beheaded,"" said Rabbi Israel Weiss, one of the leaders of the grim task to identify the victims using DNA samples, fingerprints and dental records.
The deadliest attack in Israel's 75-year history has left it deeply traumatised, but also brought a groundswell of support for a looming land, air and sea attack on Gaza involving a ""significant ground operation"".
Hamas backer Iran has warned that an invasion of Gaza would be met with a response, threatening wider security in the volatile region. 
But Germany warned Iran to ""think twice"" about inflaming the situation.
Fearful that the skirmishes with Hezbollah could escalate into a two-front war in Israel, the United States has sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean as a deterrent.With tensions intensifying, the Israeli army said it was evacuating residents who live ""up to two kilometres from the Lebanese border"".
A ship evacuating US nationals from Israel left for Cyprus from the Israeli port of Haifa Monday, an AFP correspondent reported, in anticipation of intensifying hostilities.
 
- Escalation risk -
 
The White House has voiced fears at the prospect of Iran becoming ""directly engaged"", after Tehran praised the Hamas attack but insisted it was not involved.Biden reiterated US backing for Israel in ""taking out the extremists"", but underlined that any move by Israel to occupy Gaza would be a ""big mistake"".
The United States, which like several Western governments proscribes Hamas as a terrorist group, has also appealed to China to use its influence in the region to ease tensions.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday Israel's response had ""gone beyond the scope of self-defence"", and demanded that it ""cease its collective punishment of the people of Gaza"".
Russia, which is waging war in Ukraine, called on both sides to ""immediately cease fire and start the process of political settlement.""
 
- Aid agencies' alarm - 
 
The UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees said Sunday that one million Palestinians had already been displaced in the first week of the conflict -- but the number was likely to be higher.In southern Gaza, the city of Khan Yunis, usually home to 400,000 people, has more than doubled in population within just days, with terrified families hunkering down in any available space, indoors and outdoors.
Israeli energy minister Israel Katz on Sunday said water supplies to southern Gaza had been switched back on, a week after a ""complete siege"" was announced.
But power outages threaten to cripple life-support systems, from sea water desalination plants to food refrigeration and hospital incubators.
Even everyday functions -- from going to the toilet, showering and washing clothes -- are almost impossible, locals said.
And being in the south is no guarantee of safety from Israeli air strikes.
Pointing to a doctor's house that was targeted, Rafah resident Khamis Abu Hilal said: ""All the family was wiped out.""

UN urges international probe into war violations in Gaza,"BRUSSELS - The UN human rights chief on Thursday highlighted allegations of serious rights violations in the Israel-Hamas war that he said needed ""full accountability"".
READ: Gift of the Givers staffer killed in Gaza
Volker Turk said ""extremely serious allegations of multiple and profound breaches of international humanitarian law, whoever commits them, demand rigorous investigation and full accountability"".
The UN high commissioner for human rights did not name Israel or Hamas, but he spoke after a visit last week to the Middle East, where he warned that both sides were committing war crimes in a conflict that has left thousands dead.
""Where national authorities prove unwilling or unable to carry out such investigations, and where there are contested narratives on particularly significant incidents, international investigation is called for,"" he said in a briefing to UN member states in Geneva.
Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas in retaliation for the attacks of 7 October, which it says killed 1,200 people. 
Hamas also took 239 people hostage, among them elderly people and young children, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel's relentless bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 11,500 people, also mainly civilians and including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
 
- Israel refuses access -
 
Turk decried the ""conflagration of violence (that) has been unleashed"". 
He said he had spoken to people crossing out of Gaza during a visit to the Egyptian border, and ""rarely have I heard such disturbing testimony about the catastrophic harm that ordinary people have endured"". 
He was unable to access Israel or the Palestinian territories, but stressed Thursday the urgent need for his department to go there, ""to ensure full and independent monitoring and documentation, and to coordinate protection work"".
He told reporters he had ""asked Israel to give me access both to Israel, but also to the occupied Palestinian territory. I have not yet received a response"", he said.
The Israeli mission to the UN in Geneva later dismissed his request to visit Israel, telling AFP it ""did not see any added benefit of the high commissioner's visit at this time"".
During his visit to the region last week, the Israeli mission said Turk had ""made it clear that his mind had already been made up, and therefore dialogue with (his office) would contribute little.""
 
- West Bank warning -
 
During Thursday's briefing, Turk voiced concern about the ""intensification of violence and severe discrimination against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem"".
""This creates a potentially explosive situation,"" he said.
""I am ringing the loudest possible alarm bell about the occupied West Bank.""
He urged an immediate ceasefire.
""It is apparent that on both sides, some view the killing of civilians as either acceptable collateral damage, or a deliberate and useful weapon of war,"" he said.
He also insisted that ""the Israeli occupation must end"".
""Israelis' freedom is inextricably bound up with Palestinians' freedom. Palestinians and Israelis are each others' only hope for peace.""
 
- Israel, Palestinians respond -
 
Israel harshly criticised UN attempts to balance criticism about violations, insisting that international law was ""not a suicide pact"".
If a state cannot defend itself ""or is criticised for doing so in line with international law, inevitably terrorist organisations will become more and more emboldened,"" Israeli ambassador Meirav Eilon Shahar told the gathering.
""There is no moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas. We will not let Israel be delegitimised by misrepresentation of reality,"" she said.
Palestinian ambassador Ibrahim Khraishi flatly rejected that view.
""You should wake up in this room. This is a massacre, this is genocide,"" he said, accusing Israel of acting ""above the law"".
""The problem didn't start on 7 October -- It started 75 years ago,"" he said.
He received support from other countries, including from Jordan's representative who insisted that ""Israel must halt its aggression"".
US ambassador Michele Taylor meanwhile branded the 7 October Hamas attack as ""pure evil"", and mourned the Palestinians killed ""by the violence resulting from these attacks"".
 
By Nina Larson",Thursday 16 November 2023 - 11:14am
Israel tells top US official war will last 'months',"Israel's defence minister warned Thursday the war with Hamas would last ""more than several months"" as he met a top US official amid a rift between the allies over mounting civilian casualties.
The war, now in its third month, began after the Palestinian group's unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel that Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
In response, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas and launched an unrelenting military offensive that has left swathes of Gaza in ruins. The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said 18,787 people have been killed, mostly women and children.
In Gaza's southern city of Khan Yunis, smoke rose from a grey landscape of rubble which people combed with shovels and their bare hands after a strike. One man sat on the broken concrete, wiping his eyes.
""Around four people are still stuck under the rubble"" after an airplane hit the building ""without a warning"", said Hassan Bayyout, 70.
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan arrived in Tel Aviv on Thursday and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.In their meeting, Gallant warned that Israel's fight with Hamas ""will require a period of time -- it will last more than several months, but we will win and we will destroy them"".
Ahead of his trip, Sullivan had told a Wall Street Journal event he would discuss a timetable to end the war and urge Israeli leaders ""to move to a different phase from the kind of high-intensity operations that we see today"".
US President Joe Biden, whose government has provided Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, delivered his sharpest rebuke of the war this week. He said Israel's ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza was eroding international support.
- 'Darkest chapter' -
But Netanyahu vowed to carry on ""until victory"" and Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said the war would continue ""with or without international support"".The Israeli prime minister has said there is also ""disagreement"" with Washington over how Gaza would be governed after the war.
Netanyahu rejects the two-state solution Washington is insisting upon.
Qatar-based Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said on Wednesday that ""any arrangement in Gaza or in the Palestinian cause without Hamas or the resistance factions is a delusion"".
This week, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly supported a non-binding resolution for a ceasefire, which Washington voted against.The United Nations estimates 1.9 million out of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, said on Wednesday that Gazans were ""facing the darkest chapter of their history"".
He said they are ""now crammed into less than one-third"" of the territory, and hinted there could be an exodus to Egypt, ""especially when the border is so close"".
- Hospital a focus -
Cold wintry rain has lashed the makeshift tents where the homeless struggle to survive without sufficient food, drinking water, medicines or cooking fuel, with diseases spreading.After a strike in Rafah, where many Palestinians have fled, the faces of relatives were contorted in grief after they identified the body of a child, Muhannad Ashour, at Najjar hospital. 
Despite the needs, aid distribution has largely stopped in most of Gaza, except on a limited basis in the Rafah area, the UN says.
COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, said the military ""is enabling tactical pauses for humanitarian purposes"". One was taking place Thursday for four hours in a Rafah neighbourhood to allow civilians to restock supplies such as food and water, it said.
Fewer than one-third of Gaza's hospitals are partly functioning, the UN says, and the World Health Organization expressed its concern about an Israeli raid on Kamal Adwan hospital in north Gaza.
The UN humanitarian agency OCHA said Wednesday that the hospital director and about 70 other medical staff ""remain detained in an unknown location outside of the hospital"". It said Israeli forces had released five doctors and female staff but there were reports of ""ill-treatment"" of those who had been held.
The Hamas-controlled health ministry said Israeli forces had ""fired at patient rooms"". AFP was unable to confirm the situation independently.
On Thursday the army said that, during military activity in the hospital area, ""over 70 terrorist operatives came out of the hospital with weapons in hand"".
It said troops killed ""a number"" of militants during fighting in the area.
Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals, schools, mosques and vast tunnel systems beneath them as military bases -- charges it denies.
- Cross-border fire -
Israeli tanks shelled Gaza from southern Israel on Thursday.
Militants have continued to fire rockets from Gaza towards Israeli territory.The Palestinian health ministry said Israeli forces killed 11 people in the occupied West Bank since launching a raid in Jenin and its refugee camp on Tuesday. The army says it has seized weapons, dismantled explosives laboratories, tunnel shafts and other military facilities.
The war has led to increased popular support for Hamas in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967.
In Israel, the army is coming under growing pressure to limit troop deaths -- it says 116 have been killed in Gaza -- and secure the release of remaining hostages.The Israeli military said fighter jets on Thursday struck infrastructure and compounds of Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, after a munition was launched towards northern Israel.
Israeli forces and Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, have engaged in regular exchanges of fire since the Israel-Hamas war began.
By Adel Zaanoun With Shatha Yaish In Jerusalem",Thursday 14 December 2023 - 18:37pm
Israel loses 24 soldiers in deadliest day of Gaza ground war,"Israel said Tuesday 24 soldiers were killed in the biggest single-day losses since the start of its ground war in Gaza amid growing pressure on the government to find a way to end the conflict.
The heavy clashes came as a White House official was due in the region for talks aimed at securing more hostage releases, and as US media reported a new Israeli proposal for a deal that would involve a two-month pause in fighting.
Twenty-four soldiers were killed on Monday, with the army saying 21 of them were reservists slain when rocket-propelled grenade fire hit a tank and two buildings they were trying to blow up.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an investigation was launched into the ""disaster"" and that Israel ""must learn the necessary lessons"". Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the ""deaths of 24 of our fighters, our best sons... is a heavy blow"".
More than 200 people attended the funeral of one of the reservists, Hadar Kapeluk, whose coffin was draped with an Israeli flag, at Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem.
An analyst said the mounting toll of soldiers killed -- now 221 -- since Israel launched its ground offensive in Gaza would heap pressure on the government.
""Everybody is mourning the soldiers this morning and I think people will demand clear answers about the purpose and the goal of this operation in Gaza,"" said Israela Oron of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.On the ground, fighting raged in Khan Yunis, the biggest city in southern Gaza, which the army said it had ""encircled"".
Witnesses said powerful explosions rocked Khan Yunis, as well as Deir al-Balah in north Gaza and Rafah in the south.
Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said its staff at Khan Yunis's Nasser Hospital felt the ""ground shaking"".
The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli forces had hit its headquarters in Khan Yunis ""resulting in injuries among internally displaced individuals who sought safety on our premises"".
 
- 'Looming threat of famine' -
 
UN agencies and aid groups have sounded the alarm about the growing threat of disease and famine in Gaza, where 1.7 million people are estimated to have been uprooted.
""The situation in Gaza is of course slipping every day into a much more catastrophic situation,"" with ""a looming threat of famine"", said Abeer Etefa, the World Food Programme's senior spokeswoman for the Middle East.Abu Iyad, his belongings piled on a donkey-drawn cart, said he was moving for the seventh time, fleeing Khan Yunis for Rafah on the Egyptian border, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought shelter, many in makeshift tents.
""I'm heading to the unknown,"" he told AFP. ""They told us to go to Rafah -- where to go in Rafah? Is there any space left?""
The Gaza war broke out with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attacks, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.
In response, Israel has carried out a relentless offensive that has killed at least 25,490 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.The Hamas attack also saw about 250 hostages seized, and Israel says around 132 remain in Gaza. That number includes the bodies of at least 28 dead hostages, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
A week-long truce in November saw 105 hostages released, the Israelis among them in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
Relatives of those still held captive stormed a parliamentary committee meeting on Monday demanding urgent action.
""You sit here while our children are dying over there,"" yelled Gilad Korngold, father of hostage Tal Shoham, an AFP correspondent reported.
 
- Two-state solution -
 
US news outlet Axios reported on Monday night that Israel had proposed to Hamas, via Qatari and Egyptian mediators, a new deal to free all the hostages.The report, citing unnamed Israeli officials, said the proposed deal would be carried out in multiple stages, and would also involve the release of an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners.
The plan was expected to take about two months to complete.
The proposal does not include promises to end the war, but it would involve Israeli troops reducing their presence in major cities in Gaza and gradually allowing residents to return to the territory's devastated north, Axios said.
News of the proposal comes as US media said the White House's coordinator for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, was expected in Egypt and Qatar for meetings aimed at securing a new hostage exchange deal.
State Department spokesman Vedant Patel, however, said Washington still believed ""a two-state solution, a creation of a Palestinian state, is the only path that gets us out of this endless cycle of violence"".
Netanyahu has steadfastly rejected calls for the creation of a Palestinian state, saying Israel must maintain ""security control over all the territory west of the Jordan"" River, an area that includes all of the Palestinian territories.
 
- US, UK hit Yemen's Huthis -
 
EU foreign ministers pressed Israel to change its mind at meetings in Brussels on Monday with the top diplomats from the two warring parties and key Arab states.""The two-state solution is the only solution, and even those who don't want to know about it have not yet come up with any other alternative,"" said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. 
At the gathering, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ignored questions from journalists over a future two-state solution and said his country was focused on returning the hostages and ensuring its security.
Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, who was also in attendance, said Israel's rejection of ""the two-state solution is dooming the future of the region to more conflicts"".Lebanon's Shiite movement Hezbollah said Tuesday it struck the Israeli air control base of Meron for a second time in recent weeks, in response to Israeli ""assassinations"" and attacks on civilians.
The United States and Britain launched a new wave of air strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels on Tuesday over their attacks on Red Sea shipping.
In response, the Huthis warned that ""these attacks will not go unanswered and unpunished"".",Tuesday 23 January 2024 - 15:40pm
Discussion | Diplomats vote on Israel-Palestine truce,"JOHANNESBURG - Israel is facing continued global pressure for a ceasefire in Gaza with a new UN Security Council vote currently underway.
The vote was due on Monday but the US said it could not support a reference to a “cessation of hostilities”. It said it might accept a call for a “suspension"" of hostilities.

"Stocks rise, oil prices slide","NEW DELHI - The main stock markets in Europe and the United States rose on Monday but oil prices fell as markets tracked the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Asian equity markets sank having caught up with losses in Europe and the United States on Friday as oil prices soared nearly six percent.
The safe haven dollar lost some strength on Monday.
Markets had taken fright on Friday at the possibility that a ground invasion by Israeli troops into northern Gaza, after a warning to civilians to evacuate, could spark a wider conflict.
""The worry was that the Israel-Hamas War would escalate and potentially turn into a wider conflict over the weekend when the stock market was closed for trading,"" said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
""That did not happen, so there is a measure of relief this morning,"" he added.
This sense of relief also saw oil prices slide after reaching nearly one-week highs.
""The lack of further escalation over the weekend has helped to cap the gains thus far, while reports that the US is easing restrictions on Venezuelan oil is helping to limit the upside,"" said Robert Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. 
Investors are also turning their attention to corporate earnings as companies begin to report third quarter results.
""The earnings season will be at full speed this week... (but) will likely remain under the shadow of mounting geopolitical tensions in the Middle East,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has returned to Israel after talks in six Arab states, hoping to coordinate efforts against Hamas while finding ways to alleviate Gaza's humanitarian crisis.
Four days after he paid a lightning visit to Tel Aviv to show solidarity with Israel, Blinken flew back and went straight to talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Jerusalem office.
As Israel prepares what is expected to be a major ground operation in the Gaza Strip, Blinken was later to meet Netanyahu's security cabinet.  
""The key uncertainty is whether a ground operation risks widening the conflict, with markets focused on whether Iran and its allies are drawn into the conflict,"" said National Australia Bank's Tapas Strickland. 
Adding to the unease was news the White House will tighten rules on Chinese access to semiconductor chips and chip-making equipment, maintaining a long-running security standoff between the superpowers, despite moves to ease tensions.
Traders will be keeping a close eye on speeches this week by several Federal Reserve decision-makers, including boss Jerome Powell, hoping for some idea about their plans for interest rates.
The talks come after a number of officials in recent weeks indicated they were happy to keep US borrowing costs on hold, soothing concerns about more tightening that some observers fear could flip the world's biggest economy into recession.

Dozens killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza: health ministry,"JERUSALEM - Israeli strikes killed dozens more people overnight, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Thursday, including in the territory's south where Israel has intensified operations.
The renewed strikes came as medicine for hostages held by the militants and fresh aid for civilians entered the Palestinian territory under a newly brokered deal, mediator Qatar said.
The ministry said 93 people had been killed, including 16 in a single strike on a house in the southern city of Rafah, where many people have fled.
""The strike left 16 killed, among them women and children, and 20 injured,"" the ministry said.
The Hamas government reported dozens of strikes, including on the southern city of Khan Yunis and Palestinian refugee camps in central Gaza.
Plumes of black smoke rose over Khan Yunis at dawn after the strikes.
Fighting has ravaged the Gaza Strip since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel that resulted in the death of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.At least 24,448 Palestinians, most of them women, children and adolescents, have been killed in Israeli bombardments and a ground offensive, according to figures from the health ministry.
Hamas and other militants seized about 250 hostages during the October 7 attacks, and around 132 remain in Gaza, including at least 27 believed to have been killed.
The fate of those still in captivity has gripped Israeli society, leading to pressure against the government for their release.
A broader humanitarian crisis in besieged Gaza is marked by the threat of famine and disease, fuelling international calls for a ceasefire.
Late Wednesday Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari said on X, formerly Twitter, that medicine for hostages and aid entered Gaza ""over the past few hours"" under the agreement announced on Tuesday following French and Qatari mediation.Two planes earlier arrived in the Egyptian city of El-Arish near the Gaza border with 61 tonnes of aid provided by Doha and France, including medicine and food, Qatar said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross welcomed the deal as ""a much-needed moment of relief"", under which 45 hostages are expected to receive medication.
France said the drugs would be sent to a hospital in Rafah, given to the Red Cross and divided into batches before being transferred to the hostages.
 
- 'Our life is gone' -
 
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the army was hitting Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis particularly hard to dismantle the Hamas leadership, which the army says has already been done in northern Gaza.
Israel's army announced the death of one soldier on Wednesday, bringing to 193 the total number killed in Gaza since ground operations began in late October.At the Abu Yussef Al-Najjar hospital in Rafah, Palestinians stood in front of bodies wrapped in shrouds, mourning loved ones killed in Israeli bombardment.
Hassan Gebril Franjee, a resident of central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp, returned to find his home had been destroyed.
""I wish they would stop the war because the situation is devastating. Our youth is gone. Our whole life is gone,"" he told AFP.
The United Nations says the war has displaced roughly 85 percent of Gaza's people, many of whom have crowded into shelters and struggle to get food, water, fuel and medical care.At Israel's Nir Oz kibbutz, where about one in four residents was killed or kidnapped in the Hamas attack, Yossi Schneider is clinging to hope for his relative Kfir Bibas, a baby, despite Hamas's announcing his death.
The youngest hostage kidnapped by Hamas was less than nine months old on October 7 and would be celebrating his first birthday this week.
""We are thinking about them every day, every second, every minute,"" Schneider said of Bibas and his missing brother and mother.
 
- West Bank violence -
 
Since October 7 violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank to a level not seen since the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, between 2000 and 2005.
Israeli army raids and attacks by settlers have killed around 360 people in the territory, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Israeli forces killed 10 people in the West Bank on Wednesday, the Palestinian health ministry and the Israeli army said.
Five were killed inside Tulkarem refugee camp, according to the ministry, while Israel's military confirmed an air strike that killed ""a number of terrorists"" during a raid there.
Separately, Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party, said five of its fighters died east of the city of Nablus.Among them was Ahmed Abdullah Abu Shalal, a Palestinian militant, both sides said.
The Israeli army said he was killed following intelligence ""of his cell's intentions of carrying out an imminent terrorist attack"".
Fears are mounting the Israel-Hamas conflict will trigger an all-out war across the Middle East, with growing violence involving Iran-aligned groups.
Israel has exchanged regular cross-border fire with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement since the start of the war.
Military chief Herzi Halevi warned on Wednesday the likelihood of war on Israel's northern border with Lebanon in the coming months was ""much higher"".
US forces late Wednesday said they conducted a fourth round of strikes on areas of Yemen controlled by Iran-backed Huthi rebels. United States Central Command (CENTCOM) said forces struck 14 Huthi missiles that were loaded to be fired.
The latest strikes came after Washington said it would re-designate the Huthis as a ""terrorist"" entity, for their attacks on merchant vessels in the Red Sea vital to world trade.CENTCOM said a US-owned and operated, Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier had been hit but was still sailing.
The United States and Britain bombed scores of targets inside Huthi-controlled Yemen last week in response to attacks by the rebels.",Thursday 18 January 2024 - 10:50am
Battle rages around Gaza hospital as truce talks to resume,"GAZA - Heavy fighting raged Monday in and around Gaza's largest hospital complex where the Israeli army said it was battling Hamas militants and told Palestinian civilians to flee the ""dangerous combat zone"". 
While the army launched the pre-dawn raid at Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital, the Israeli government deployed Mossad chief David Barnea to Qatar for renewed talks toward a ceasefire and hostage release deal.
Qatari and Egyptian mediators hope to pause or end the war that has devastated Gaza since the October 7 attack -- even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has doubled down on his vow to destroy Hamas.
Gaza's soaring civilian death toll, the large-scale devastation and the looming threat of famine for its 2.4 million people have hardened opposition to Israel's military campaign and siege.A UN-backed food security assessment warned that half of Gazans are experiencing ""catastrophic"" hunger, and that ""all evidence points towards a major acceleration of deaths and malnutrition"".
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Israel's military campaign had turned Gaza from the world's ""greatest open-air prison"" into its biggest ""open-air graveyard"" and that Israel was using famine as a ""weapon of war"".
Foreign Minister Israel Katz replied that ""Israel allows extensive humanitarian aid into Gaza"" and told Borrell ""to stop attacking Israel and recognise our right to self-defence against Hamas' crimes"".
In the latest heavy battle, Israel's army raided Al-Shifa, with witnesses reporting air strikes and tanks near the complex reportedly crowded with thousands of Palestinian patients and displaced people.
The health ministry of the Hamas-run Gaza Strip said nearby residents had reported dozens of casualties who could not be helped ""due to the intensity of gunfire and artillery shelling"".
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that ""we are terribly worried"" about the fighting which was ""endangering health workers, patients and civilians"".
 
- Hospital battle -
 
The Israeli military told Gazans to evacuate the area amid the raid that it said was based on intelligence ""indicating the use of the hospital by senior Hamas terrorists"".Israel's military dropped Arabic-language leaflets warning residents that ""You are in a dangerous combat zone!"" and urging them to flee the area.
The Hamas government media office condemned as a ""war crime"" the ""storming of the Al-Shifa medical complex with tanks, drones and weapons and shooting inside"".
The army previously raided Al-Shifa in November, sparking an international outcry, in an operation in which it said it found weapons in rooms in and below the hospital where it believed hostages had been held.
Israel's military said Monday that troops had been told to ""avoid harm to the patients, civilians, medical staff and medical equipment"", with Arabic speakers deployed. The bloodiest ever Gaza war broke out after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on October 7 that resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
The Islamist militants also seized about 250 hostages, of whom Israel believes 130 remain in Gaza, including 33 who are presumed dead.
Israel has carried out a relentless bombing campaign and ground offensive that Gaza's health ministry says has killed at least 31,726 people, most of them women and children.
As the fighting flared around A-Shifa, the army announced that the number of its soldiers killed in the Gaza ground invasion launched in late October had risen to 250.
 
- Truce talks -
 
Global concern has focussed on Gaza's far-southern city of Rafah, where about 1.5 million Palestinians now live in crowded shelters and tent cities near the Egyptian border.Netanyahu's repeated warnings of a looming ground invasion have raised fears the civilians would be in the line of fire, and Israel's top ally the United States has stressed Israel must ensure civilians are ""out of harm's way"".
The Israeli premier on Sunday reiterated that civilians would be evacuated from Rafah before any ground attack, without detailing where to.
""Our goal in eliminating the remaining terrorist battalions in Rafah goes hand-in-hand with enabling the civilian population to leave Rafah,"" he said.
Efforts toward a truce and hostage release deal -- which have involved US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators -- were expected to resume in Qatar, following a week-long ceasefire in November.Hamas had so far called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces, a demand which Netanyahu has rejected as ""delusional"".
A new Hamas proposal calls for an Israeli withdrawal from ""all cities and populated areas"" in Gaza during a six-week truce, and for vastly more aid, according to an official from the group.
It proposes a 42-day truce during which it would release about 42 hostages -- each in exchange for between 20 and 50 Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli custody.
The exchange could include women, children, elderly and ill hostages, whereas male soldiers and the bodies of dead hostages would be returned during a later, comprehensive exchange to coincide with a full ceasefire. Netanyahu's office said on Friday that Hamas's new proposal was ""unrealistic"" but that the government would send a delegation to Doha for another round of talks.
Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported Monday that ""the cabinet approved the departure of the delegation with a mandate to hold the negotiations. The delegation will leave today.""
A source close to the talks said on condition of anonymity that a meeting between Barnea, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani and Egyptian officials ""is expected to take place today"".

Israel army readies for Gaza invasion as civilians flee,"GAZA - Israeli forces were on Sunday readying for a looming Gaza ground invasion aimed at destroying Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist militant group that unleashed the bloodiest attack in the country's history.
In the eight days since Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,300 Israelis in their surprise onslaught, Israel has responded with a devastating bombing campaign that has claimed over 2,300 lives in Gaza.
Fear and chaos reigned in the 40-kilometre (25-mile) long strip that is one of the world's most densely populated areas, with no safe place for the large numbers of internally displaced Palestinians to flee to.Entire Gaza city blocks lay in ruins and hospitals were overflowing with thousands of wounded in the besieged territory, but there were fears of worse to come.
A bereaved and infuriated Israel has massed forces outside the long-blockaded enclave of 2.4 million ahead of what the army has said will be a land, air and sea attack involving a ""significant ground operation"".
Israel has also stationed troops and tanks on its UN-patrolled northern border with Lebanon and closed a four kilometre (2.5 mile) wide zone there to civilians after repeated exchanges of cross-border fire with Hezbollah and other militants groups.
 
- 'More is coming' -
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited front line troops in the south near Gaza on Saturday, wearing a flak jacket. ""Are you ready for what is coming?"" he said. ""More is coming.""
Israel's military spokesmen have repeatedly said that the army is ready for a ground operation but awaiting a ""political decision"" on the timing.
Special forces have made forays into Gaza and recovered the bodies of some of the up to 150 hostages feared taken by Hamas. Israel has said it has identified more than 120 captives, while Hamas has claimed 22 have died in Israeli air strikes.
A Gaza ground invasion threatens to bring the kind of gruelling house-to-house fighting that devastated Iraq's Mosul and Fallujah in years past, further complicated for Israeli forces by Hamas' vast tunnel network.Israel has warned 1.1 million Palestinians to leave northern Gaza and a steady stream of families in overloaded cars, trucks and donkey carts have since headed south.
Israel has accused Hamas of blocking them from fleeing in order to use them as ""human shields"".
 
  'Catastrophic situation' 
 Alarm has grown about a wider humanitarian crisis in Gaza where Israel has cut off water, food and power, vowing to maintain the complete siege until all hostages are freed.
""The situation is catastrophic,"" said Jumaa Nasser, who travelled from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza with his wife, mother and seven children.
""We've had no food or sleep. We don't know what to do. I've given my fate up to God.""
China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi charged that Israel's actions have gone ""beyond the scope of self-defence"" and said it must ""cease its collective punishment of the people of Gaza"".Egypt to the south controls the only other crossing with Gaza but has so far refused to open it to help evacuate foreign citizens unless aid convoys are allowed to enter, according to unnamed intelligence sources cited in media reports.
Anger has flared in much of the Muslim world and beyond, with pro-Palestinian protesters burning Israeli and American flags.Militant groups allied with Israel's arch foe Iran have a strong presence in Lebanon and Syria, heightening the risk of a multi-front war for Israel's army as deadly clashes have also flared in the occupied West Bank.
The past week has seen repeated clashes on Israel's northern frontier with Lebanon where the Iran-back Hezbollah movement has tried to send small groups of militants across the heavily fortified border.
The United States has deployed a second aircraft carrier to the region in an effort to ""deter hostile actions against Israel"", Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said.
 
 Grief and fury 
 The mood in Israel has swung between collective grief, fury and a strong desire to punish Hamas which Netanyahu has likened to the Islamic State group.
Public outrage has been fuelled by images and reports virally shared on social media of youths and families shot, stabbed, burnt and mutilated in the Hamas attack.
Israel pushed on with its evacuation of southern towns that were targeted in the Hamas attack and where air raid sirens kept wailing. Packed buses were taking families to hotels in Jerusalem and the Red Sea resort city Eilat.""We're going to Eilat, we'll be back as soon as possible,"" said Helen Afteker, 50, from Sderot, a city of 30,000.  
""It's hard, I'm crying. It's terrifying every time there's a warning, we have to leave. It's better for the children."" 
The army said Sunday a strike had killed Billal Al Kedra, the Hamas commander ""responsible for the Kibbutz Nirim massacre"" where residents were killed in their homes and others were under siege for nine hours before soldiers rescue them.
The army has called up 300,000 reserve units while convoys of trucks have rushed heavy armour to the south.Planeloads of Israelis have returned from around the world to join the latest of the many wars in Israel's 75-year history, while a large carpark in the coastal city of Haifa has been converted into a hospital.
Over the past week, Israel has levelled thousands of buildings in Gaza while Hamas has fired thousands of rockets at Israel, most intercepted by missile defence systems.
Gaza's electricity outage threatens to cripple the enclave's life-support systems, from sea water desalination plants to food refrigeration and baby incubators in hospitals.US President Joe Biden told Netanyahu in a call Saturday that the United States was working with the United Nations, Egypt, Jordan and others ""to ensure innocent civilians have access to water, food and medical care"".
The White House said Biden also spoke with Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas and pledged ""full support"" to the Palestinian Authority in its efforts to bring humanitarian aid to Palestinians, ""particularly in Gaza"".",Sunday 15 October 2023 - 14:00pm
UN Security Council due to vote on delayed Gaza resolution,"The United Nations Security Council was due to vote Wednesday on a much-delayed resolution calling for a pause to the Israel-Hamas war after members wrangled over wording while aid efforts in the Gaza Strip neared collapse.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza was rapidly deteriorating, with a senior UN official saying Israel's steps to allow in aid were ""far short"" of mounting need.
Members of the council had grappled for days to find common ground on the resolution, a vote on which was pushed back several times throughout Tuesday, after being postponed Monday. 
An official scheduling document said the 15-member body would finally vote on Wednesday.
Israel, backed by its ally the United States, a veto-wielding permanent Security Council member, has opposed the use of the term ""ceasefire.""
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday there would be no ceasefire in Gaza until the ""elimination"" of Hamas.
But Russia and the Arab League stepped up diplomatic pressure on Israel to bring fighting to a close, using the Russian-Arab Cooperation Forum in Morocco to call for a ceasefire.
Richard Gowan, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, said that ""everyone is basically stuck waiting to see what the US will decide to do.""
""It looks like even US diplomats do not know how this saga will end,"" he added, after several US diplomats gave non-committal answers when asked what would happen and why the vote had been delayed through Tuesday.
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said he did not want to ""get ahead of a resolution that hasn't been voted on yet.""
This week's back and forth comes after an impasse earlier this month when the United States, despite unprecedented pressure from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, blocked the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the war. 
It had called for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"" in the Gaza Strip, where Israel continues its deadly strikes in retaliation for Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack.
 
- 'Human catastrophe' -
 
Last week, the UN General Assembly adopted the same nonbinding resolution by 153 votes to 10, with 23 abstentions, out of 193 member states.
Bolstered by that overwhelming support, Arab countries announced the new attempt at the Security Council.A draft text prepared by the UAE, obtained by AFP on Sunday, called for ""an urgent and lasting cessation of hostilities to allow unimpeded access of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.""
The last version seen by AFP was, however, a modified text that seemingly sought to salvage a compromise.
It was less direct, calling for ""the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities.""
United Nations official Tor Wennesland said Tuesday that Israel's ""limited"" steps to allow aid into Gaza ""are positive, but fall far short of what is needed to address the human catastrophe on the ground.""
After the attack on October 7, which Israeli authorities say left around 1,140 people dead, most of them civilians, Israel vowed to ""annihilate"" Hamas. 
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says Israel's military response has killed 19,667 people, mostly women and children.

Palestinians say deadly strike hit Gaza hospital,"GAZA - Palestinians said Friday a deadly strike hit Gaza's largest hospital compound as heavy fighting between Hamas and Israel has sent tens of thousands of civilians fleeing their homes.
READ: Tens of thousands flee as Israel tightens Gaza City 'stranglehold'
Gaza's Hamas government, which reported a toll of 13, and the director of the Al-Shifa hospital, blamed Israeli troops for the strike at the facility sheltering people trying to flee the fighting. Israel did not immediately comment.
Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiya reported two people were killed and 10 wounded in a strike that he said hit the compound's maternity ward.
A Hamas government statement said: ""Thirteen martyrs and dozens wounded in an Israeli strike on Al-Shifa compound today"" in central Gaza City, giving a toll AFP was not immediately able to independently verify.
On Thursday Israel had reported heavy fighting near the hospital, saying it had killed dozens of militants and destroyed tunnels that are key to Hamas's capacity to fight.
The Israeli army has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals, particularly Al-Shifa, to coordinate their attacks against the army and also as hideouts for its commanders. Hamas authorities deny the accusations.Israel launched an offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters poured across the militarised border on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 240 hostages.
Vowing to destroy the militants, Israel retaliated with bombardment and a ground campaign that the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip says has killed more than 10,800 people, mostly civilians and many of them children.
Abu Mohammad, 32, had taken refuge in the hospital along with 15 relatives after the bombardments of his neighbourhood in the northeast part of Gaza City.
 
- 'No safe place' -
 
""There is no safe place left. The army hit Al-Shifa. I don't know what to do,"" he said.  ""There is shooting...  at the hospital. We are afraid to go out.""
Witnesses said tanks had surrounded some other hospitals in Gaza City as fierce fighting continued, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee to the south of the territory over the past few weeks.AFPTV footage showed a fireball and smoke rising over the city at dawn. Early Friday sounds of apparent gunfire and explosions could be heard.
The heavy fighting in the densely populated coastal territory, which is effectively sealed off, has prompted repeated calls for a ceasefire to protect civilian lives.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected halting the fighting, telling Fox News Thursday that a ""ceasefire with Hamas means surrender to Hamas, surrender to terror.""
He also looked ahead to the war's end, saying Israel does not ""seek to govern Gaza.""
""We don't seek to occupy it, but we seek to give it and us a better future,"" he told Fox.
Tens of thousands of civilians have streamed out of devastated northern Gaza in recent days, with men, women and children clutching meagre possessions as they emerge from the devastated warzone in a river of humanity.They have fled close-quarter fighting, with Hamas militants using rocket-propelled grenades against Israeli troops backed by armoured vehicles and heavy airstrikes.
The UN agency responsible for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said 70,000 people had travelled south on the route since November 4, most of them walking.
Almost 1.6 million people have been internally displaced since October 7, it added, more than half the area's population.
But the UN estimates hundreds of thousands of civilians remain in the fiercest battle zones in the north.
- Hostages -
Charities in Gaza's south, where Palestinians have fled from the heavy fighting to the north, are trying to help by preparing meals for as many people as possible.""As you can see large number of people come here and we can't feed all of them, children, elderly, women. They come here to have food,"" said Ibrahim Shallouf, a Palestinian volunteer.
Israel has accused Hamas of using hospitals including Al-Shifa to hide its military operations. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the alleged bombardments.
Complicating Israel's military push is the fate of the hostages abducted on October 7.
CIA director Bill Burns and David Barnea, head of Israel's Mossad spy agency, were in Doha for talks on pauses that would include hostage releases and more aid for Gaza, an official told AFP.
Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad released a video Thursday claiming to show two hostages -- a woman in her 70s and a 13-year-old boy -- which, if verified, would suggest not all captives are held by Hamas.
Israel's military called the video ""psychological terrorism"".""We don't sleep well. We don't eat well,"" Ronen Neutra, whose son Omer is being held hostage, told AFP in an interview.
""Everything stopped.""
Inside Gaza, the intense combat and effective blockade of the densely populated territory have led to increasingly dire conditions.
 
- Regional tensions -
 
Donors at an aid conference in Paris have pledged around $1.1 billion, but access to Gaza remains very limited, with around 100 trucks a day able to enter, far below the pre-war average.
""In our most conservative scenario, this conflict is likely to set back development (in the Palestinian territories) by well over a decade,"" UNDP administrator Achim Steiner told AFP.
Israeli officials, however, insist there is ""no humanitarian crisis"" in Gaza.Violence has surged in the occupied West Bank since the conflict erupted, with at least 14 Palestinians killed on Thursday alone, according to the Ramallah-based health ministry.
The conflict has also stoked regional tensions, with cross-border exchanges between the Israeli army and Lebanon's Hezbollah, and Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels saying they launched ""ballistic missiles"" at southern Israel.
A drone hit a school in southern Israel's Eilat on Thursday and Israeli air defences later intercepted a missile over the Red Sea, the military said.
On Friday, the military said it struck the source of the drone, in Syrian territory.
It did not identify the organisation behind the drone, but said it ""holds the Syrian regime fully responsible for every terror activity emanating from its territory.""

UN agency warns of 'halt' to Gaza aid operations,"JERUSALEM - A UN agency warned it could be forced to stop aid operations in war-riven Gaza on Wednesday due to dwindling fuel supplies, as calls mounted for a humanitarian ""pause"" in fighting.
After 18 days of withering Israeli air strikes and a near-total land, sea and air blockade of the Palestinian territory, UN refugee agency UNRWA warned operations were at breaking point.
""If we do not get fuel urgently, we will be forced to halt our operations in the Gaza Strip,"" said the UN agency, which provides aid to 600,000 displaced Gazans.
Israel launched its campaign in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas militants on October 7.
Gunmen from the Palestinian group poured into Israel from Gaza, killing more than 1,400 people and taking 222 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to ""eliminate Hamas"" and ensure it can no longer threaten Israeli civilians.
But there is growing international unease about the impact of Israel's ""Operation Swords of Iron"", which has killed thousands of Palestinians.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry claims 5,791 people have been killed in the war so far, many of them children.
Tuesday's toll was more than 700 people, the Hamas-run ministry said, with the UN saying it was the highest reported in a single day since the war began.
AFP has not been able to independently verify these figures.
Aid agencies report hospitals are overwhelmed, generators lack fuel and shelters are heaving under the weight of an estimated 1.4 million displaced -- more than half the population.
Since the war began a few dozen trucks with essential supplies have been allowed to cross the Egyptian border into Gaza, far fewer than necessary according to aid agencies. 
The Palestine Red Crescent said Tuesday it had received the fourth batch of humanitarian aid, consisting of eight trucks.
The supplies have included medicines, food and water, but not fuel, which Israel fears could end up in Hamas's hands.
 
- 'Epic suffering' -
 
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday said Gaza was now seeing ""epic suffering"" while calling on Israel to safeguard civilians.
""The relentless bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces, the level of civilian casualties, and the wholesale destruction of neighbourhoods continue to mount and are deeply alarming,"" he told the UN Security Council in New York.
""I am deeply concerned about the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza,"" he said. ""Let me be clear: No party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law.""
That warning drew an angry response from Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who cited the graphic ways in which Israeli civilians had been killed by Hamas, and demanded: ""Mr secretary-general, in what world do you live?"" 
Israel and its allies have so far rebuffed calls for a blanket ceasefire, which the White House says would only benefit Hamas.
But US officials have indicated that a more limited ""humanitarian pause"" in certain areas could be on the table to allow aid in and to safeguard civilians. 
President Joe Biden has said a full ceasefire could only be considered if and when Hamas releases the hundreds of hostages it is keeping captive in Gaza.
Meanwhile, Israel has continued massing tens of thousands of troops around Gaza ahead of an expected ground offensive.
That operation appears to have been stalled by concerns about objectives, the fate of hostages, civilian casualties and the difficulties of fighting in a densely populated area riven with underground tunnels.
""There are a lot of obstacles,"" one Israeli soldier serving with unit 601 of the military engineering corps told AFP on condition of anonymity.
""The enemy is spraying rockets and other things that I cannot detail to prevent us from progressing.""
 
- 'First objective' - 
 So far Hamas has only released four hostages, including 85-year-old Israeli Yocheved Lifshitz. 
Reuniting with family after more than two weeks in Hamas captivity, on Tuesday she spoke about the ""hell"" of her abduction.
She recalled how gunmen raided her kibbutz home, throwing her over the back of a motorbike and beating her as they stole away into Gaza.
""They didn't break my ribs, but they hurt me very much,"" she told reporters.
She and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper were released on ""compelling humanitarian"" grounds, according to Hamas, following mediation by Qatar and Egypt.
Both of their octogenarian husbands are still in Gaza. 
During a visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron said freeing hostages must be ""the first objective"" of Israel's military campaign.
He also called for the international coalition fighting the Islamic State group to be expanded to ""also fight against Hamas"".
Throughout the war, Hamas has continued to launch rocket attacks and raids into Israel.
Warning sirens wailed across central Israel on Tuesday afternoon and the Iron Dome air defence system was seen intercepting missiles near Tel Aviv, AFP correspondents said.
The Israeli military also said it had ""targeted a cell of (Hamas) divers"" that tried ""to infiltrate Israeli territory by sea in the area of kibbutz Zikim"" just north of Gaza.
Amid fears that the Israel-Hamas conflict is spilling over into the broader Middle East, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday warned Hamas ally Iran that the United States would respond ""decisively"" to any attack by its proxies.
""The United States does not seek conflict with Iran. We do not want this war to widen,"" he said after several reported attacks on US forces in Iraq by Iran-back groups.
""But if Iran or its proxies attack US personnel anywhere, make no mistake. We will defend our people, we will defend our security -- swiftly and decisively,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council session.

Israel bombs Gaza as Egypt hosts Hamas to discuss truce proposal,"RAFAH - Israel pounded Gaza on Friday as Egypt hosted a Hamas delegation for talks aimed at ending the conflict that has devastated much of the besieged Palestinian territory. 
READ: Israel bombs south Gaza as Hamas officials due in Cairo
With vast areas of northern Gaza in ruins and largely deserted, Israeli air strikes and ground combat have focussed on central and southern districts, driving ever more displaced families into crowded areas around Rafah near the Egyptian border.
Intense fighting around central Deir al-Balah and the biggest southern city, Khan Yunis, has driven about 100,000 newly displaced people into already-overcrowded Rafah, said the UN humanitarian office, even as targets there were bombed too.Rafah residents combed through rubble for survivors and bodies after a deadly air strike Thursday. 
One local man, Tayseer Abu al-Eish, said he was at home when ""we heard a loud explosion and debris started falling on us. My daughters were screaming.""
The relentless bombardment has caused mass civilian casualties and sparked global calls for a ceasefire as alarm has mounted over the dire fate of Palestinians enduring hunger and sleeping in makeshift shelters in the cold winter months.
After another strike, in Deir al-Balah, one bereaved mother, Suhair Nasser, wept as she cradled the bodies of her twin children, exclaiming that ""the house was bombed and the debris fell on the kids on 28 December, their birthday"".The military said it had ""eliminated dozens of terrorists"" across Gaza over the past 24 hours and was ""extending operations in Khan Yunis"", the hometown of Hamas's Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar.
Gunmen of Hamas, considered a ""terrorist"" group by the United States and European Union, launched an attack on October 7 that left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
The Palestinian militants also took about 250 people hostage, more than half of whom remain captive inside the war zone, some of them believed dead.Israel's relentless military campaign since then has killed at least 21,507 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza.
Israel's army says 168 soldiers have been killed inside Gaza.
Hamas's military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said Friday it had launched a fresh barrage of rockets at southern Israel.
 
- UN convoy attacked -
 The UN says more than 80 percent of Gaza's population has been driven from their homes, with many now living in cramped shelters or tents around Rafah.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said 308 people seeking shelter in their facilities have been killed.
UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths bemoaned ""an impossible situation for the people of Gaza, and for those trying to help them"". 
""You think getting aid into Gaza is easy? Think again,"" he wrote Friday on X, formerly Twitter. 
A UN aid convoy came under fire by the Israeli military without causing casualties, UNRWA said.
The severe shortages have been only sporadically eased by humanitarian aid convoys entering primarily via Egypt.A truckload of fresh food, including meat, eggs and fruit, reached a Rafah market Friday, bringing some relief.
""This is the first time eggs and some types of fruit have entered Gaza from Egypt,"" said vendor Muntasser al-Shaer.
""All types of fruit are missing in the markets. There are some types of vegetables but they're really expensive.""
 
- Cairo truce plan -
 While Israel has repeatedly vowed to destroy Hamas, Cairo has proposed a plan involving renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and ultimately an end to the war, say sources close to Hamas.
Speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, a Hamas official said the delegation would ""give the response of the Palestinian factions, including several observations"" regarding the proposal Egypt recently submitted to Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
Hamas would seek ""guarantees for a complete Israeli military withdrawal"" from Gaza, the official said.Israel is yet to formal comment on the Cairo plan but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told families of hostages on Thursday that ""we are in contact"" with the Egyptian mediators and promised that ""we are working to bring them all back"".
Egypt's State Information Services chief Dia Rashwan said the plan was ""intended to bring together the views of all parties concerned, with the aim of ending the shedding of Palestinian blood"".
In Tel Aviv, hundreds rallied on Thursday calling for a ceasefire.
""Israelis, Palestinians, Muslims, Jews, Christians -- this is everybody's home,"" said one demonstrator, teacher Itay Eyal, 51, who stressed that all sides are entitled to ""life, freedom, sovereignty and dignity"".He said ""the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7 will never be pardoned and excused"" but added that ""if you don't see the historical context, then you're condemned to repeat the same tragedy over and over again.""
Tensions have also flared in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian motorist who had wounded four people in an alleged car ramming attack.
The Gaza war has also seen violence flare elsewhere across the Middle East, where Israel has long waged a shadow war with its arch foe Iran and armed groups allied with Tehran.
Israeli forces have traded heavy cross-border fire with Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah since the Gaza war erupted.On Friday the army said it struck ""Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon"" after rocket fire from there.
A US warship shot down a drone and an anti-ship ballistic missile fired Thursday by Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels, the US military said.
The Huthis have repeatedly targeted vessels in the vital Red Sea shipping lane with strikes they say are in support of Palestinians in Gaza.

Fierce Gaza fighting renews as truce hopes fade,"PALESTINE - Israel and Gaza militants traded heavy fired Friday as hopes faded of securing a truce to end days of fighting that have killed dozens, all but one of them Palestinian.
The violence has been met with international calls for de-escalation, with the European Union pushing Thursday for an ""immediate comprehensive ceasefire"".
Israel announced it was ""striking Islamic Jihad targets"" in the densely populated Palestinian territory, while AFP journalists saw air strikes hit Gaza City.
Sirens warning of incoming fire meanwhile rang out in Israeli communities close to the border with the Gaza Strip, as well as blaring in an Israeli settlement near Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank.
Violence broke out Tuesday when Israel killed three top members of the Islamic Jihad militant group, while subsequent strikes have killed two other senior figures.Islamic Jihad said the latest rocket fire, seen by AFP journalists, was a ""response to the assassinations and the continued aggression against the Palestinian people"".
It came hours after a rocket killed one civilian in the central Israeli city of Rehovot on Thursday evening.
At least 31 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's health ministry, including militants and several civilians as well as children.
Daily life in the coastal territory, ruled by the Hamas militant group, has largely come to a standstill, while Israel has told its citizens near Gaza to stay close to bomb shelters.
In Gaza's central Deir al-Balah area, farmer Belal Basher stood beside the ruins of the home he said was hit by multiple Israeli strikes.
""Our situation is the same as that of any Palestinian citizen whose house is targeted and whose dream, built over the years, is destroyed,"" the 33-year-old told AFP.
Earlier Friday there had been cautious optimism a truce may be nearing, with an Islamic Jihad source telling AFP a deal drawn up by Cairo had been circulated among the group's leadership.
""Israel must commit to stopping the assassinations in Gaza and the West Bank,"" a second source within Islamic Jihad said, detailing the group's key condition for a ceasefire.
- Home 'seriously shaking' -The decision to renew air strikes on Gaza this week was authorised by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who returned to power in December alongside extreme-right and ultra-Orthodox Jewish allies.
The violence has left more than 90 people wounded in Gaza, according to the latest health ministry toll.
Israel's Magen David Adom emergency services has treated five people hit by shrapnel, glass or suffered blast injuries from the rocket fire.
In Rehovot, 82-year-old resident Ran Lev said he was heading to the bomb shelter when the rocket hit which killed his neighbour.
""The entire apartment was seriously shaking. All the photo frames fell,"" he said.The United States, which along with Brussels has blacklisted Islamic Jihad and Hamas, urged that steps be ""taken to ensure that violence is reduced"".
The Israeli military said it has hit 170 Islamic Jihad targets this week, while more than 860 rockets have been fired from Gaza.
Israel said a quarter of the rockets fell inside Gaza and killed four, including three children, an accusation Islamic Jihad and Hamas did not respond to when approached by AFP.
This week's escalation is the worst since August, when 49 Gazans were killed in three days of fighting between Islamic Jihad and Israel.
At least 19 of those fatalities were children, according to the United Nations, while rocket fire wounded three people in Israel.
That conflict followed multiple wars fought between Israel and Hamas since the group took control of Gaza in 2007.",Friday 12 May 2023 - 00:12am
Dozens of rare manta rays caught off Gaza coast,"GAZA CITY - Dozens of manta rays were laid out on a beach in the blockaded Gaza Strip as local Palestinian fishermen celebrated the mass catch.
The rare fish flock to the Mediterranean waters off the coast of Gaza every year in March and April.
Fishing is a major commercial activity in Gaza, which has been under an Israeli-led blockade since 2007, when Islamist movement Hamas took over the territory.
Fisherman Bashir Shoueikh caught more than 10 of the rays, each weighing between 200 and 300kg.
They sell for around 12 shekels ($3.30) per kilo.
""Each boat carries between 20 and 30 of these fish,"" Shoueikh told AFP. ""People like them a lot.""
The fishing zone off Gaza, determined by Israel, varies from five to 16 nautical miles, depending on the security situation.
The two species of manta ray -- manta alfredi and manta birostris -- are both on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's red list of threatened species due to their declining numbers.",Tuesday 14 March 2023 - 16:15pm
WHO says Gaza mass evacuation would be 'disastrous',"GAZA - The World Health Organization said Friday that a mass evacuation of the northern Gaza Strip would be ""disastrous"" for hospital patients, with hospitals in the south already at full capacity. 
Israel has given Palestinians 24 hours to leave the northern Gaza Strip ahead of an expected ground offensive in retaliation against Hamas for the deadliest attack in Israeli history. 
""The Palestinian Ministry of Health has informed WHO that it is impossible to evacuate vulnerable hospital patients without endangering their lives,"" the UN health agency said in a statement.
""Vulnerable patients include those who are critically injured or dependent on life support. Moving them amid hostilities puts their lives at immediate risk."" 
The WHO joined other UN bodies in calling for Israel to rescind the evacuation order. 
""A mass evacuation would be disastrous -- for patients, health workers and other civilians left behind or caught in the mass movement,"" it said.
The two major hospitals in the north of the Gaza Strip have already greatly exceeded their combined 760-bed capacity, ""with severe overcrowding"", the WHO said. 
""Of the thousands of patients with injuries and other conditions receiving care in hospitals, there are hundreds that are severely wounded and over 100 who require critical care. These are the sickest of the sick,"" it said.
Many thousands more, also with wounds or other health needs, cannot access any kind of care, the WHO noted.
Furthermore, the four health ministry hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip are already at or beyond capacity, and lack the critical care capacity and supplies needed to treat additional patients, said the WHO.
WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic earlier told reporters in Geneva that the Gaza Strip's health system was now at ""breaking point"", with six of the seven main hospitals only partially functioning.
WHO calls for ""an end to hostilities and violence in the Gaza Strip, where unimaginable human suffering is unfolding"" the spokesman said.
- Time 'running out' -
Concern is rising over the worsening humanitarian crisis in the long-blockaded Palestinian enclave, where Israel has now imposed a total siege, cutting off water, food and energy supplies.
With dwindling supplies of food, water and health services and without adequate shelter, people will be ""at heightened risk of disease"", said the WHO.
The UN agency's pre-positioned supplies in Gaza have mostly been consumed. 
The WHO is calling for an immediate humanitarian corridor to be established into the Gaza Strip.
Supplies which WHO had pre-positioned in Gaza have mostly been consumed. 
The organisation has prepared medical supplies for more than 300,000 patients with a range of wounds and diseases at its logistics hub in Dubai. It stands ready to deliver them to Arish in Egypt -- close to the southern Rafah crossing into Gaza. 
""Time is running out to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe if fuel, water, food and life-saving health and humanitarian supplies cannot be urgently delivered to the Gaza Strip amidst the complete blockade,"" said Jasarevic.

Gaza economy shrank by more than 80% in 4th quarter due to conflict: World Bank,"The Israel-Hamas war has had a ""catastrophic"" impact on Gaza's infrastructure and caused its economy to contract by more than 80 percent in the fourth quarter of the year, the World Bank said. 
The ongoing conflict has caused widespread damage and destruction across Gaza, and caused a ""massive loss of life,"" the Bank said a statement.
The October 7 Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel -- mostly civilians -- according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.  
Hamas militants also took around 250 hostages -- 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 30 presumed dead, according to Israel. 
Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed almost 30,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest count by the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. 
Beyond the devastating human impact, ""Almost all economic activity in Gaza has ground to a halt,"" the Bank said. 
""Since the start of the conflict, the Palestinian economy experienced one of largest shocks recorded in recent economic history,"" it added. 
The World Bank pointed to preliminary estimates from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), which found that Gaza's GDP has ""plummeted by more than 80 percent"" -- from around $670 million in the third quarter to just $90 million in the fourth quarter. 
This 80 percent quarterly decline amounts to an annual a drop of 24 percent, the Bank continued, adding that ""the observed level of fixed assets damage and destruction is catastrophic.""
""Nearly every resident of Gaza will live in poverty, at least in the short term,"" it said. 
Amid the ongoing conflict, the Bank announced a $30 million grant Thursday ""to help ensure the continuity of crucial education for children.""
""This grant will contribute to the education sector to help ensure that learners don't miss out on essential education,"" it said in a statement. ",Thursday 22 February 2024 - 19:40pm
UN chief calls for donors to maintain Gaza aid,"UNITED NATIONS - The UN chief called on donor states to guarantee the flow of aid to Gaza after several halted funding to the agency for Palestinians over claims some of its staff participated in the October 7 attacks.
While the row over the UNRWA aid agency for Palestinian refugees deepened, heavy fighting in the besieged Gaza Strip sent more people fleeing south towards the Egyptian border.
UNRWA said on Friday it had fired several employees over Israel's unspecified accusations about the involvement of some of its staff in Hamas's October 7 attack.
Donors including Germany, Britain, Italy, Australia and Finland on Saturday followed the lead of the United States, which said it had suspended additional funding to the agency over the accusations.
""While I understand their concerns -- I was myself horrified by these accusations -- I strongly appeal to the governments that have suspended their contributions to, at least, guarantee the continuity of UNRWA's operations,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement late on Saturday.
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called for UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini to quit after saying earlier the body ""must be replaced with agencies dedicated to genuine peace and development"" after Gaza's bloodiest war.
""Mr Lazzarini please resign,"" Katz said on social media platform X late on Saturday in response to a post by the UNRWA chief warning that the funding cuts meant the agency's operation in Gaza was close to collapse.
Guterres said the ""abhorrent alleged acts"" of some UNRWA staff should not mean that its thousands of other humanitarian workers were penalised.
""The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met,"" he said.
Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages and Israel says around 132 of them remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead captives.
Israel's ensuing military offensive has killed at least 26,257 people, most of them women and children, in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the territory.
 
- UN shelter hit -
 
Long-strained relations between Israel and UNRWA deteriorated rapidly after the UN body condemned tank shelling it said had hit a shelter for displaced people in Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis on Wednesday.
It said tens of thousands of displaced people had been registered at the shelter and that the tank shelling killed 13 people.The Israeli military has promised a thorough review but has also said it was examining the possibility it was a ""result of Hamas fire"".
Its military campaign is now centred around Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas's Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar, where it said on Saturday numerous militants were killed.
There were heavy clashes there overnight, including mortar rounds fired by militants at Israeli tanks, the armed wings of militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said.
Rockets were also fired into southern Israel, they said, and there was fighting in several neighbourhoods of Gaza City and further north.
At least 129 people were killed in Israeli strikes overnight, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which described the health crisis in the territory as ""catastrophic"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing growing domestic pressure over his handling of the conflict, doubled down on his vow to eliminate Hamas from besieged Gaza.
""If we don't eliminate Hamas terrorists... the next massacre is only a matter of time,"" he said in a televised statement on Saturday.
Experts have told AFP that Netanyahu's steadfast promise to eliminate Hamas is increasingly seen within his war cabinet as incompatible with returning the hostages held in Gaza.
Protesters carrying posters of the hostages and banners calling to ""bring them home"" gathered again in Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv on Saturday, as well as near Netanyahu's residence in the upscale coastal town of Caesarea.
 
- Ceasefire sought -
 
The UNRWA row follows the UN's International Court of Justice ruling on Friday that Israel must prevent possible acts of genocide in the conflict, and allow in more aid, although it stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.Diplomatic efforts to find a solution have also gathered pace.
CIA chief William Burns is to meet his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts, as well as Qatar's prime minister, in Paris soon to seek a ceasefire, a security source told AFP.
A week-long cessation of hostilities in November saw Hamas release dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
The New York Times said on Saturday US-led negotiators were getting closer to an agreement under which Israel would suspend its war in Gaza for about two months in return for the release of more than 100 hostages.
Quoting unidentified US officials, it said negotiators had developed a draft agreement that would be discussed in Paris on Sunday. 
 
- Displaced flee south -
 
Palestinians are fleeing further south from Khan Yunis towards Rafah, close to the Egyptian border, where the United Nations says most of Gaza's estimated 1.7 million displaced people have gathered.AFP images showed people wading through ankle-deep water around plastic shelters in Rafah, where bombardment still threatens.
The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) aid group has said surgical capacity at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis was ""virtually non-existent"".
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said the Al-Amal hospital was also ""under siege with heavy gunfire"".

Turkey detains 33 accused of spying for Israel,"ISTANBUL - Turkey announced on Tuesday it had detained 33 people suspected of planning abductions and spying on behalf of Israel's Mossad intelligence service.
Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the suspects were rounded up in raids across Istanbul and seven other provinces.
It was not immediately clear if they were Israeli nationals or locals allegedly working with Mossad.
Yerlikaya's office released video footage showing armed security service agents breaking down doors and handcuffing suspects in their homes.
The Istanbul public prosecutor's office said 13 additional suspects remained at large.
The raids came weeks after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of ""serious consequences"" should Israel attempt to target figures from Palestinian militant group Hamas living or working in Turkey.
""There is an insidious operation and sabotage attempts being made against Turkey and its interests,"" Erdogan said after the raids were announced.
""We will definitely destroy this game,"" he said in televised remarks.
Relations between Turkey and Israel imploded following the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly three months ago.
Erdogan has turned into one of the world's harshest critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The Turkish leader last week compared Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler and demanded that Israel's Western allies drop their support for the ""terrorism"" being conducted by Israeli troops in Gaza.
Erdogan has also recalled Ankara's envoy to Tel Aviv, and pushed for the trial of Israeli commanders and political leaders at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
The president's ruling Islamic conservative AKP party also led tens of thousands of protesters out on the streets of Istanbul on Monday for one of Turkey's biggest anti-Israel rallies of the entire war.
 
- End of thaw -
 
The Gaza war ended a gradual thawing in Turkish-Israeli relations that culminated with the reappointment of ambassadors in 2022.
Israel and Turkey resumed long-stalled talks about a major Mediterranean Sea natural gas pipeline project that could have reshaped geopolitical alliances across parts of the Middle East.
Turkey won words of gratitude from Israel in 2022 for detaining a group of Turkish and Iranian nationals were allegedly planning to murder and kidnap Israeli tourists in Istanbul.
Erdogan and Netanyahu met briefly on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting in New York in September and were discussing holding a formal summit this year.
The Turkish MIT intelligence service conducts periodic raids against suspected Israel operatives working in major cities such as Ankara and Istanbul.
Most are accused of conducting surveillance work on Palestinians living in Turkey.
Istanbul served as one of Hamas's foreign political offices until the outbreak of the Gaza war.
Turkey informally asked Hamas leaders to leave, days after militants conducted raids into southern Israel on 7 October that resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people.
The Islamists also took around 250 people hostage. Israeli officials believe more than half of them remain in Gaza.
The Gaza health ministry says Israel's relentless military campaign has killed around 22,000 people in Gaza since 7 October-- mostly women and children.
UN agencies have voiced alarm over a spiralling humanitarian crisis facing Gaza's 2.4 million people, who remain under siege and bombardment, most of them displaced and huddling in shelters and tents, amid dire food shortages.

Turkey celebrates centenary under shadow of Gaza war,"ANKARA - Turkey marks its centenary as a post-Ottoman republic on Sunday with somewhat muted celebrations held under the shadow of Israel's escalating war with Hamas militants in Gaza.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will be front and centre of day-long events that both honour the secular republic's founder and play up the achievement of the Islamic-rooted party running Turkey since 2002.
Erdogan and World War I-era military commander Mustafa Kemal Ataturk have become the seminal figures of the modern Turkish state.
Ataturk is lionised across Turkish society for driving out invading forces and building a brand new nation out of the fallen Ottoman Empire's ruins in the wake of World War I.
Turkey was formed as a Western-facing nation that stripped religion from its state institutions and tried to forge a modern new identity out its myriad ethnic groups.
It eventually became a proud member of the US-led NATO defence alliance and a beacon of democratic hopes in the Middle East.
But Ataturk's social and geopolitical transformation of the overwhelmingly Muslim nation created divisions that weigh on Turkish politics to this day.
Erdogan tapped into these as he led his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power over the leftist Republican People's Party (CHP) formed by Ataturk.
He has spent much of the past decade testing the limits of Turkey's secular traditions as well as its ties with the West.
These competing forces will be on full display as Erdogan starts the day by paying respects to Ataturk -- and ends it by overseeing celebrations of Turkey's more recent achievements while he was prime minister and president.
- Palestinian cause -
Sunday's celebrations have been partially eclipsed by Erdogan's increasingly fierce attacks against Israel over its response to the October 7 Hamas attacks.The militants killed 1,400 people and took 220 hostages in a surprise raid that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the worst ""since the Holocaust"".
Israel has retaliated with ferocious air strikes and an unfolding ground offensive that the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says has claimed more than 8,000 lives.
Turkish state television has also scrapped the broadcast of concerts and other festivities because of the ""alarming human tragedy in Gaza"".
Erdogan's lifelong defence of Palestinian rights has turned him into a hero across large parts of the Muslim world.
He announced that 1.5 million people had come out for a pro-Palestinian rally in Istanbul on Saturday that ended up drowning out national television coverage of the centenary.
Erdogan accused the Israel government of behaving like a ""war criminal"" and trying to ""eradicate"" Palestinians.
""Israel, you are an occupier,"" Erdogan declared.
His remarks prompted Israel to announce the withdrawal of all diplomatic staff for a ""re-evaluation"" of relations.
- Turbulent spell -
The emerging diplomatic crisis further pulled attention away from Turkey's birthday party and onto Erdogan's handling of global affairs.
Turkey has suffered a turbulent spell of relations with Western allies since Erdogan survived a failed coup attempt in 2016 that he blamed on a US-based Muslim preacher.Istanbul's Kadir Has University lecturer Soli Ozel saw Saturday's pro-Palestinian rally as part of Erdogan's tacit effort to undermine Ataturk's secular vision.
""Couldn't (this rally) have waited until next week? The centenary only comes around once in a century,"" Ozel said in an interview.
But one survey suggested that Erdogan's comments play to his Islamic conservative core of supporters and not the public at large.
The Metropoll survey showed just 11.3 percent of the respondents saying they ""back Hamas"".

UN chief to visit Gaza border as Israel vows to go ahead with Rafah attack,"TEL AVIV - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is expected to visit Egypt's border with Gaza on Saturday, after Israel said it would send in troops to fight Hamas in the nearby city of Rafah, even without US support.
During his visit, Guterres plans to reiterate his call for a humanitarian ceasefire, though renewed international pressure has so far failed to dissuade Israel from the planned ground offensive in Rafah, where most of Gaza's population has taken shelter.
Despite warnings that such an invasion would cause mass civilian casualties and worsen the humanitarian crisis gripping the territory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he must press ahead with the attack.
""I hope to do that with the support of the United States, but if we need to, we will do it alone,"" Netanyahu told visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday.
International efforts to pause the almost six months of fighting have grown increasingly desperate, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting 32,070 people killed in Gaza as of Friday and experts warning the entire population is teetering on the brink of famine. 
The ministry reported early Saturday morning another 67 people killed overnight, including 10 in a strike on a family home north of Gaza City.
""This is a man-made catastrophe,"" the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) Philippe Lazzarini wrote on social media platform X. He added that a ceasefire and ""flooding Gaza with food + lifesaving goods"" was the only solution. 
The latest bid for a Security Council resolution on an ""immediate"" ceasefire failed on Friday as China and Russia vetoed the American proposal, which Arab governments complained was too weak.
Diplomatic sources said that a vote on a new ceasefire text, initially planned for Saturday, would be postponed until Monday to allow for further discussions.Meanwhile, the violence has continued, particularly around Gaza's largest hospital complex, Al-Shifa, where Israeli forces claimed on Friday to have killed more than 150 Palestinian fighters and arrested hundreds of suspects.
At a funeral for the Barbakh family in the southern city Khan Yuins on Friday, relatives described seemingly endless losses.
""Every day we lament over a loved one,"" Turkiya Barbakh said. ""At the beginning of the war I lost my nephew, and now my sister, her husband and her children. Almost the entire family has perished.""
""How long are we supposed to endure this?""
 
- 'Defeat of Hamas' -
 
On Saturday, UN chief Guterres plans to meet with aid workers on the Egyptian side of Rafah, just across the border from the Gazan city where 1.5 million Palestinians have taken refuge. 
The city had been the subject of a disagreement between Netanyahu and Blinken in Tel Aviv on Friday.
""We have no way to defeat Hamas without getting into Rafah and eliminating the battalions that are left there,"" Netanyahu said. 
Afterward, Blinken said an invasion of Rafah was ""not the way to achieve"" that aim.
""We have the same goals as Israel: the defeat of Hamas,"" the top American diplomat wrote on X after the meeting. ""Next week I will meet again with Israeli officials in Washington to discuss a different way we can achieve this objective.""In a reflection of the increasing strain between the Biden and Netanyahu administrations, Israel announced the seizure of 800 hectares (1,980 acres) of land in the occupied West Bank on the same day as Blinken's visit. 
Successive Israeli governments have sharply accelerated the expansion of settlements across the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, which are regarded as illegal under international law.
Peace Now said the land seizure announced on Friday was the biggest since the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo Accords in the 1990s.
""You know our views on settlement expansion,"" Blinken said. ""Anyone taking steps that make things more difficult, more challenging with time is something we have a problem with.""
Blinken, on a whistlestop tour of the region to support truce talks in Qatar, also expressed disappointment Friday over the failed UN resolution.He accused China and Russia of ""cynically"" using their vetoes as permanent members of the council, while Hamas expressed its ""appreciation"".
While diplomats sparred in New York, Israel's spy chief David Barnea headed to Qatar for truce negotiations with CIA chief William Burns and Qatari and Egyptian officials.
The mediators are aiming to secure the release of Israelis still held by Gaza militants in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody and the delivery of more relief supplies.
 
- 'Starvation as method of war' -
 
Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages, of whom Israel believes around 130 remain in Gaza, including 33 presumed dead.
Since the start of its retaliatory campaign, Israel has imposed a near-complete blockade on Gaza, heavily restricting the flow of humanitarian aid, which mainly comes in from Egypt via Rafah.
According to the UN, these tight controls have reduced aid deliveries to barely a trickle.
""Before October 7, an average of 500 to 700 trucks entered Gaza every day. Today, the average is barely 150,"" UNRWA chief Lazzarini said.Israel rejected the allegation.
To try to alleviate the shortages, several countries have airdropped food and opened a sea corridor from Cyprus to Gaza. But the aid is still insufficient to meet the needs of Gaza's 2.4 million inhabitants.

Israel pounds Gaza ahead of UN truce vote,"Israel hit Gaza with air strikes on Tuesday as world powers grappled with how to broker a ceasefire ahead of a UN Security Council vote that was expected to be blocked by a US veto.
A total of 103 Palestinians were killed in the past 24 hours of Israeli strikes and ground combat in the besieged Hamas-ruled territory, its health ministry said. 
The United Nations has sounded the alarm over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, warning that food shortages could lead to an ""explosion"" of preventable child deaths.
More than four months of relentless fighting have flattened much of the coastal territory, pushed 2.2 million people to the brink of famine and displaced three-quarters of the population, according to UN estimates. 
""How many of us have to die... to stop these crimes?"" said Ahmad Moghrabi, a Palestinian doctor in southern Gaza's main city, Khan Yunis. ""Where is the humanity?""Global powers trying to navigate a way out of the spiralling crisis have so far come up short, with a push later Tuesday for a UN ceasefire resolution facing an expected US veto.
After months of struggling for a united response, all EU members except Hungary called Monday for an ""immediate humanitarian pause"". 
They also urged Israel not to invade Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, where nearly 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering, many in makeshift tents. 
The city, the last untouched by Israeli ground troops, is also the main entry point for desperately needed relief supplies via neighbouring Egypt. 
Israel's strikes on the city are hampering humanitarian operations, while the food supply is disrupted by regular border closures, says the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.The scarcity of food and safe water has triggered a steep rise in malnutrition, the UN children's fund warned Monday. 
One in six children in northern Gaza are now acutely malnourished, UNICEF said, a situation poised to ""compound the already unbearable level of child deaths"".
 
- 'Dying of hunger or bombing' -
 
The war started when Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli figures. 
Hamas militants also took about 250 hostages -- 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 30 presumed dead, according to Israel.Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 29,195 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest count by the territory's health ministry.
For weeks, Israel has concentrated its military operations in Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas's leader in the territory Yahya Sinwar, the alleged architect of the October 7 attack.
""Troops are continuing intensive operations in western Khan Yunis and killed dozens of terrorists over the past day,"" the army said on Tuesday, adding that it had also struck a Hamas arms depot in the city triggering secondary explosions.
The Hamas government said dozens of air strikes had hit the city accompanied by tank fire.""We don't know where to go -- every place is being bombed,"" said Zeitoun resident Abdullah Al-Qadi, 67.
Farther south in Al-Zawayda, Ayman Abu Shammali said his wife and daughter had been killed in an Israeli missile strike.
""People in the north are dying from hunger, while here we are dying from bombing,"" he said.
 
- Veto threats -
 
Israel has rebuffed repeated calls to spare Rafah, including from its closest ally the United States.It has warned that, unless all Israeli hostages still held in Gaza are freed by the start of Ramadan on March 10 or 11, it will push on with its offensive during the Muslim holy month, including in the city.
""If by Ramadan the hostages are not home, the fighting will continue everywhere to include the Rafah area,"" said war cabinet member Benny Gantz. 
International mediators have been scrambling to avert the assault and its feared mass civilian casualties. 
At the UN Security Council, two rival ceasefire proposals have been put forward.
The first, drafted by Algeria, demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and ""unconditional release of all hostages"".
It met swift opposition from the United States, which put forward an alternative draft.
That text, seen by AFP on Monday, emphasises ""support for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza as soon as practicable"". 
It also expresses concern for Rafah, warning that a major ground offensive ""would result in further harm to civilians"" and displacement.According to a diplomatic source, the draft stands little chance of being adopted in its current form and risks a Russian veto.
While Washington has pressed a truce-for-hostages deal, weeks of talks involving US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators have failed to reach an agreement. 
Hamas has threatened to walk away from negotiations unless more aid gets into Gaza. It has also issued a number of other demands that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed as ""delusional"".
In Jerusalem, Israeli protesters on Monday marched to Netanyahu's residence, accusing him of abandoning the hostages.
""There is no other way to get these people back without a deal,"" said protester Eli Osheroff.",Tuesday 20 February 2024 - 14:30pm
Israeli army says bodies of hostages likely held in Gaza hospital,"The Israeli army alleged on Thursday that bodies of hostages could be held at a hospital in southern Gaza, after troops raided the facility which medics say has been ""besieged"" for a month.
The military said troops were involved in a ""precise and limited operation"" inside Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis city, after intense fighting between troops and Hamas militants around the facility.
""We have credible intelligence from a number of sources, including from released hostages, indicating that Hamas held hostages at the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis and that there may be bodies of our hostages in the Nasser hospital facility,"" it said in a statement.
The military did not provide evidence or immediately respond to AFP's questions regarding when they may have been at the facility, for what purpose or whether soldiers had ever located a hostage inside a Gaza hospital.
The health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza has reported that thousands of people who had sought refuge at the Nasser hospital, including patients, have been made to leave in recent days.
Footage circulating on social media, which AFP could not independently verify, shows scores of people walking through a narrow alley as they left the hospital.
Another video clip showed rescuers trying to move patients from the hospital's orthopaedic ward, after it was reportedly struck, to safer rooms.
Using mobile flashlights, rescuers were seen dragging a patient on a bed, while some others carried another sick person in a blanket amid fallen debris.
Another video sent by the health ministry in Gaza showed a row of patients on their beds in a packed corridor of the hospital's medical building.
A nurse has told AFP of deadly sniper fire, sewage in the emergency room, and a lack of drinking water.
Israeli forces operating across the Gaza Strip have repeatedly raided hospitals, insisting the facilities are being used as command centres by Hamas militants.
Hamas denies such accusations and the Israeli military has not shown concrete proof of such command centres.
 
- 'Critical' facility -
 
The World Health Organization has described Nasser hospital as a critical facility ""for all of Gaza"", where only a minority of hospitals are even partly operational.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday he was ""alarmed"" by reports from Nasser hospital, which he described as the ""backbone of the health system in southern Gaza"".
The agency has been denied access to the facility in recent days and has lost contact with staff there, Tedros wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
Gaza's health ministry has called the situation at Nasser ""catastrophic"", with staff unable to move bodies to the morgue because of the risks involved.
The military said its ""mission is to ensure that the Nasser hospital continues its important function of treating Gazan patients"".
Hamas on October 7 carried out an unprecedented attack that resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.
Palestinian militants also took about 250 people hostage. Around 130 of them remain captive in Gaza, including 29 believed dead, according to Israeli officials. 
Earlier this week Israeli forces rescued two hostages from the southern Gaza city of Rafah during bombing that killed, according to Gaza's health ministry, about 100 people.
Since the war began at least 28,663 people have been killed in Gaza, most of them women, children and adolescents, according to the territory's health ministry.",Thursday 15 February 2024 - 15:00pm
UN warns of 'growing misery' in Gaza,"GAZA - Israeli forces pounded the northern Gaza Strip on Friday as UN chief Antonio Guterres warned of an ""avalanche of human suffering"" in the battered Palestinian territory.
The Israeli military said it had increased its strikes on Gaza ""in a very significant way"", as AFP live footage captured intense bombardment of the territory's north.
READ: Gaza war sparks Arab fears of new Palestinian displacement
The armed wing of the Islamist group Hamas that runs Gaza said it responded with ""salvos"" of rockets aimed at Israel.
Hamas said all internet connections and communications across Gaza had been cut, and accused Israel of taking the measure ""to perpetrate massacres with bloody retaliatory strikes from the air, land and sea"".
""We will continue to strike in Gaza City and around,"" Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised address.
Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping over 220 others, according to Israeli officials.
""Salvos of rockets in the direction of the occupied territories (Israel) in answer to the massacre of civilians,"" Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said on its Telegram channel.
The Hamas-run health ministry said Friday Israeli strikes on Gaza had now killed 7,326 people, mainly civilians and many of them children.
The UN chief warned that Gaza faces ""an unprecedented avalanche of human suffering"" because of the lack of food, water and power during Israeli bombing in response to the October 7 attack.
""I repeat my call for a humanitarian ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and the delivery of life-saving supplies,"" Guterres said in a statement.
""Misery is growing by the minute. Without a fundamental change, the people of Gaza will face an unprecedented avalanche of human suffering.""
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees had earlier warned that ""many more will die"" in Gaza from catastrophic shortages after nearly three weeks of bombardment by Israel.
The UN human rights office also raised the alarm over ""war crimes"" being committed as the Israel-Hamas conflict raged into its 21st day.
Concern is growing about regional fallout from the conflict, with the United States warning Iran against escalation while striking facilities in Syria it says were used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and others.
Israel's military on Friday accused Hamas of using hospitals in Gaza as operations centres for directing attacks.
""Hamas wages war from hospitals,"" in the territory, military spokesman Daniel Hagari said, and alleged the group was also using fuel stored in these facilities for its operations.
The allegation was swiftly denied by a senior Hamas official who said it had ""no basis in truth"".
 
- War crimes -
 
Israel has cut supplies of food, water and power to Gaza, notably blocking all deliveries of fuel saying it would be exploited by Hamas to manufacture weapons and explosives.""People in Gaza are dying, they are not only dying from bombs and strikes, soon many more will die from the consequences of (the) siege,"" said UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini.
""Basic services are crumbling, medicine is running out, food and water are running out, the streets of Gaza have started overflowing with sewage,"" he said of the densely populated territory where 45 percent of housing is reported to have been damaged or destroyed.
In Geneva, the UN human rights office raised the alarm over war crimes.
""Nowhere is safe in Gaza. Compelling people to evacuate in these circumstances... and while under a complete siege raises serious concerns over forcible transfer, which is a war crime,"" spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said of Israel's order for northern Gaza residents to flee south.
 
- 'Nothing more than crumbs' -
 
A first tranche of critically needed aid was allowed in at the weekend, but since then only 74 trucks have crossed. Before the conflict, the UN says an average of 500 trucks were entering Gaza every day.""These few trucks are nothing more than crumbs that will not make a difference,"" Lazzarini said, insisting Gaza needed a ""meaningful and uninterrupted aid flow"" and a ""humanitarian ceasefire to ensure this aid reaches those in need"".
His words echoed a call from EU leaders on Thursday for ""continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid"".
A first team of six medics from the International Committee of the Red Cross entered Gaza Friday via its Rafah crossing with Egypt, along with six aid trucks, the ICRC said.
Between the bombardments and the fuel shortages, 12 of Gaza's 35 hospitals have been forced to close, and UNRWA said it has had to ""significantly reduce its operations"".
With tens of thousands of Israeli troops massed along the Gaza border ahead of a widely expected ground offensive, the army said it had staged another brief ground incursion into Gaza, the second in as many days.
""We carried out a ground operation in central Gaza... as part of preparations for the coming stages of the war,"" the army's Hagari said. The first incursion had targeted northern Gaza.
Hamas said Israel had tried to stage ""a large-scale amphibious operation on Rafah's coast"" in southern Gaza at dawn but it had been thwarted, and the soldiers had ""fled by sea, leaving behind a quantity of weapons"".
Israel confirmed the operation, saying troops had struck ""Hamas military infrastructure and... a compound"" used by Hamas militants.
 
- 'Wherever we go, we will die' -
 
The army also updated to 229 the number of hostages held by Hamas, many of whom hold foreign passports, with their families frantic about their fate.""I have never felt such a feeling of helplessness,"" said 23-year-old Ella Ben Ami whose parents were kidnapped. With recurring nightmares every single night, she says she feels ""like the living dead"".
Militants also fired rockets on Friday towards Tel Aviv. One stuck the city, wounding three people, one moderately and two lightly, medics said.
Violence has also risen sharply in the occupied West Bank since the October 7 attacks, with more than 100 Palestinians killed and over 1,900 wounded.
Another four Palestinians were killed Friday during Israeli raids in the northern cities of Jenin and Qalqilya, the health ministry said.

Blinken to meet Palestinian leader after urging Israel to spare Gaza civilians,"MIDDLE EAST - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to hold talks Wednesday with the head of the Palestinian Authority, which Washington hopes could govern Gaza after Israel's war with Hamas ends.
The United States' top diplomat was on his fourth crisis visit to the Middle East since the war in the Gaza Strip began, meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Tuesday.
Blinken told a news conference afterwards that the United States would continue to support its ally, but also called on Israel to do more to protect those trapped in the besieged Palestinian territory, saying the ""daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly children, is far too high"".
Washington has floated a post-war scenario in which a reformed Palestinian Authority, currently led by president Mahmud Abbas, governs Gaza in addition to the West Bank.
The authority currently exercises limited rule in the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967.
""Israel must stop taking steps that undercut Palestinians' ability to govern themselves effectively,"" Blinken said Tuesday, emphasising the importance of progress towards a two-state solution.
""The Palestinian Authority also has a responsibility to reform itself, to improve its governance -- issues I plan to raise with president Abbas,"" he added.
Netanyahu, however, has shown no interest in reviving negotiations towards a Palestinian state, and a post-war plan outlined by Defence Minister Yoav Gallant envisions local ""civil committees"" governing Gaza after Israel has dismantled Hamas.
Blinken declined to say whether Netanyahu's views had shifted in their discussions.Multiple attempts at reconciliation have failed, but Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said last week he was ""open to the idea"" of a single Palestinian administration in Gaza and the West Bank.
Jordan's royal palace, meanwhile, said King Abdullah II would host Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Wednesday for talks on Gaza, including efforts to ""push for an immediate ceasefire"".
 
- 'We see no hope' -
 
The war in Gaza began after Hamas launched its unprecedented October 7 attack, which resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also took around 250 hostages that day. Israel says 132 of them remain in Gaza, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.Israel has responded with relentless bombardment and a ground invasion of Gaza that have killed at least 23,210 people, mostly women and children, the Hamas-run territory's health ministry said Tuesday.
The ministry announced on Wednesday that another 70 people were killed and more than 130 wounded in overnight attacks.
The Israeli army announced the death of another soldier early Wednesday, bringing the total killed since its ground invasion began to 186.
The war has displaced the vast majority of Gaza's population, and dire shortages of food, water and medicine have left hundreds of thousands at risk of famine and disease, UN agencies have said.
AFP footage on Tuesday showed a crowd of Gazans rushing towards aid trucks that were carrying flour and canned goods into Gaza City, in the territory's devastated north, with some climbing up the sides of the vehicles and tossing down food.
""We've been listening to the news for 98 days, hoping that the war will end, but due to this difficult situation we see no hope,"" Ibrahim Saadat told AFP at a camp for displaced people in the southern border town of Rafah.
""Due to the lack of water, we shower just once per month. Psychologically we are suffering, and diseases have spread everywhere.""
The World Health Organization warned on Tuesday that its ability to provide aid and support to Gazan hospitals was ""shrinking"".During his visit, Blinken called for ""more food, more water, more medicine"" to be delivered to the territory, and said that Israel had agreed to a UN assessment in the north to ""determine what needs to be done to allow displaced Palestinians to return safely"".
Israel says it has largely achieved military control over northern Gaza and that operations are focussing further south. 
In the southern city of Khan Yunis, wounded people, some of them children, were rushed to hospital on Tuesday after a strike hit displaced Palestinians living in tents at Al-Mawasi camp.
""We were chatting under a palm tree, and suddenly we saw stones and shrapnel everywhere,"" young Lama Abu Gemmayzeh told AFP. 
""Some of us started running, and others were on the ground, and we started screaming for ambulances.""
The Israeli army said it was keeping up its operations in the Khan Yunis and Maghazi areas on Wednesday, with more than 150 targets hit.
It said troops found 15 tunnel shafts in Al-Maghazi as well as rocket launchers, missiles, drones and explosive charges. 
 
- Fears of escalation -
 
Since the war started, fears have grown of an escalating conflict between Israel and its other regional enemies, a loose alliance of Iran-backed armed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
Defence Minister Gallant told Blinken on Tuesday that intensifying pressure on Iran was ""critical"" and could prevent a regional escalation, an Israeli government statement said.
Hours later, Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen ""launched a complex"" drone and missile attack in the southern Red Sea, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said.US and British forces shot down 18 drones and three missiles in the latest attack, CENTCOM said, adding no casualties or damage were reported.

Turkish club send Israeli player to Maccabi after Gaza controversy,"TEL AVIV - Turkish first division club Basaksekir on Thursday sent Israeli midfielder Eden Karzev on loan to Maccabi Tel Aviv following a probe into his repost of a social media message calling for the release of hostages held by Hamas militants.
The Istanbul side launched disciplinary proceedings against Karzev earlier this week after the defensive midfielder shared a message reading: ""Bring Them Home Now"".
The probe came the same day Israeli footballer Sagiv Jehezkel was briefly detained and charged with incitement to hatred for displaying a message about the Gaza war after scoring a goal for Antalyaspor
Jehezkel left Turkey after being formally charged in an Istanbul court on Monday.
Basaksekir took Karzev on loan from Israeli outfit Maccabi Tel Aviv last year.
""The player was fined in accordance with the club's disciplinary instructions, and it was deemed appropriate for the football player to continue his career abroad,"" Basaksekir said in a statement.
Maccabi said the 23-year-old -- capped five times by Israel -- was joining the Tel Aviv side on loan from Basaksekir for the remainder of the season.
""Eden Karzev returns to Maccabi after an agreement was reached with Turkish side Basaksehir for the loan of the 23-year-old midfielder until the end of the 2023/24 season with an option to make the move permanent,"" the Israeli side said.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has become one of the Muslim world's harshest critics of Israel over the scale of death and destruction in Gaza.
Turkey's overnight detention of Jehezkel outraged top Israeli officials.
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said it showed that ""Turkey has become a dark dictatorship"".
Fighting has ravaged Gaza since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel that resulted in the death of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Militants seized about 250 hostages during the October 7 attacks, around 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel is conducting relentless bombardment and a ground offensive.
These have killed at least 24,620 Palestinians, around 70 percent of them women, children and adolescents, according to Gaza health ministry figures.

Israel says 22 dead in 'war' after militants enter from Gaza,"GAZA - Palestinian militants had begun a ""war"" against Israel which they infiltrated by air, sea and land from the blockaded Gaza Strip on Saturday, Israeli officials said, a major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
READ: Palestinian water woes highlight dashed hopes of Oslo Accords
Israeli medics reported 22 people killed.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""we are at war"" and vowed severe retaliation after ordering an extensive mobilisation of army reserves. ""The enemy will pay an unprecedented price"" for the surprise attack, he warned.
Iran-backed Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, released a video showing its fighters had captured three men dressed in civilian clothes and described as ""enemy soldiers"" in the video caption.""We decided to put an end to all the crimes of the occupation (Israel). Their time for rampaging without being held accountable is over,"" said the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the Hamas armed wing.
""We announce Operation Al-Aqsa Flood and we fired, in the first strike of 20 minutes, more than 5,000 rockets.""
Israel's army said its forces were fighting Palestinian militants on the ground in several locations near the Strip. It dubbed its operation ""Swords of Iron"".
Army spokesman Richard Hecht said the militants conducted a combined raid ""which happened through paragliders, through the sea and through the ground"".
He would not be drawn on reports that Israelis had been captured.
Unverified videos on social media showed bodies of a number of people in military fatigues as well as dead motorists and passengers on a highway.""Send help, please!"" one woman sheltering with her two-year-old child pleaded as militants shot at her house and tried to break into their safe room, according to Israeli media.
Militant infiltration from Gaza, an impoverished enclave home to 2.3 million people, has been rare since Hamas took control in 2007, leading to Israel's crippling blockade. Gaza is sealed off from Israel by a militarised border barrier.
The rocket barrage from Gaza -- which Hecht said numbered at least 2,200 -- left cars burning beneath residential buildings in the Israeli city of Ashkelon, about 10 kilometres north of Gaza.
 
- 'Gates of hell' -
 
The attack occurred on Shabbat and during a Jewish holiday.Netanyahu said in a statement that the Hamas attack will be riposted at ""a magnitude that the enemy has not known"".
Israeli Major General Ghasan Alyan warned Hamas had ""opened the gates of hell"" and would ""pay for its deeds"".
AFP journalists said Israel's military began air strikes on Gaza, after rockets began streaming across the sky from inside the territory beginning at 6:30 am (0330 GMT).
The military said dozens of its fighter jets ""are currently striking a number of targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip.""An AFP journalist saw armed Palestinians gathered around an Israeli tank, which was partially in flames, after they crossed the border fence from Khan Yunis in Gaza.
Another AFP journalist saw Palestinians returning to Gaza City driving a seized Israeli Humvee.
Air raid sirens wailed across southern and central Israel, as well as an unusual number of times in Jerusalem, where AFP journalists heard multiple rockets being intercepted by Israeli air defence systems.
The army urged people to stay near bomb shelters.
 
- Hundreds of Gazans flee -
 
Israeli police set up roadblocks to check motorists on the highway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, an AFP journalist said.Hundreds of residents fled their homes in Gaza to move away from the border with Israel, mostly in the territory's northeast, an AFP correspondent said, adding the men, women and children carried blankets and food.
In the Israeli commercial centre of Tel Aviv, residents were seen boarding a bus to seek safety in a hotel.
An AFP photographer in the city saw a gaping hole in a building, with residents gathered outside.In Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, some Palestinian residents cheered and blew their car horns as sirens blared.
Israel's Magen David Adom emergency medical services said that, by early afternoon, its teams ""have pronounced 22 victims deceased"" from gunshots, while hundreds more were wounded.
Among the dead was the president of a regional council for Israeli communities northeast of Gaza. The council said its president was killed in an exchange of fire with Gaza attackers.
 
- Hamas calls to 'join battle' -
 
Hamas called on ""the resistance fighters in the West Bank"" as well as ""our Arab and Islamic nations"" to join the battle, in a statement posted on Telegram.An adviser to Iran's supreme leader said he was ""proud"" of the Hamas action.
Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which fought a devastating war against Israel in 2006, hailed the Palestinians' ""heroic operation on a grand scale"".
The Gaza fighting erupted as Washington attempts to mediate a landmark deal which would see Israel and Middle East powerhouse Saudi Arabia establish diplomatic ties.
Western capitals roundly denounced the Palestinian attacks on Israel.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called it ""terrorism in its most despicable form,"" while her foreign policy chief expressed ""solidarity with Israel"".
The EU, US and Israel consider Hamas to be a terrorist group.United Nations Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said the assault against Israeli communities and civilians has led to ""a dangerous precipice and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink"".
The violence follows heightened tensions in September, when Israel closed the border to Gazan workers for two weeks.
That shutdown came as Palestinian demonstrators along the border burned tyres and threw rocks and petrol bombs at Israeli troops, who responded with tear gas and live bullets.
In May, an exchange of Israeli air strikes and Gaza rocket fire killed 34 Palestinians and one Israeli.
Violence between Israel and the Palestinians has been surging since early last year.Before Saturday's violence at least 247 Palestinians, 32 Israelis and two foreigners have been killed in the conflict, including combatants and civilians on both sides, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.
The vast majority of fatalities have occurred in the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.

Hamas gives 'initial' support to Gaza truce plan as fighting rages,"Fighting in Gaza raged on Friday with scores reported killed overnight, after mediator Qatar said Hamas had given its ""initial"" support to a hostage-prisoner exchange deal that would pause its war with Israel.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said 112 people had been killed over the previous 24 hours, while the Hamas press office reported Israeli air and artillery bombardment around Khan Yunis -- southern Gaza's main city and the focus of recent fighting.
Gaza City resident Abir al-Madhun said leaflets calling on civilians to leave had again been dropped by Israeli aircraft over the Al-Shifa Hospital compound where she has sought refuge.
""Our houses were destroyed; our children were killed. Where should we go?"" she asked. ""The shooting must stop so we can find a place to live.""
Nearly four months of fighting have left Gaza ""uninhabitable"", the United Nations says, while an Israeli siege has resulted in dire shortages of food, water, fuel and medicines.
Winter storms brought torrential rain to Gaza Friday, piling more misery on the hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians who have sought shelter in bombed out buildings and makeshift camps.The humanitarian crisis and the mounting civilian death toll have triggered growing international calls for a ceasefire.
After a truce proposal agreed with Israeli negotiators was presented to Hamas on Thursday, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said there were hopes of ""good news"" about a fresh pause to the fighting ""in the next couple of weeks"".
Ansari said a truce plan thrashed out with Israeli negotiators by Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators in Paris earlier this week had received a ""positive"" initial response from Hamas.
""That proposal has been approved by the Israeli side and now we have an initial positive confirmation from the Hamas side,"" he said.
But a source close to Hamas told AFP: ""There is no agreement on the framework of the agreement yet -- the factions have important observations -- and the Qatari statement is rushed and not true.""A Hamas source said the group had been presented with a three-stage plan which would start with an initial six-week halt to the fighting that would see more aid deliveries into Gaza.
The pause would also see the release of ""women, children and sick men over 60"" among the Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, the source said, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks.
- A deal 'right now' -
The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.Militants also seized about 250 hostages, and Israel says 132 remain in Gaza, including at least 27 believed to have been killed.
After the attack, Israel launched a withering offensive that has killed at least 27,131 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
Visiting Khan Yunis on Thursday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told troops that the city's Hamas brigade had been ""dismantled"" and the ""same will happen in Rafah"", the border town where hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians have sought refuge.
Gallant reiterated the government's position that only military force can secure the release of Israeli hostages, telling troops their operations ""bring us closer to enabling the return of the hostages, because Hamas only responds to pressure"".The government's tough line has faced mounting opposition inside Israel, with protesters gathering again in Tel Aviv on Thursday night carrying placards featuring hostages' faces and slogans such as ""No more bloodshed"".
""This government, our leadership, needs to make decisions and they need to be brave,"" said activist Moran Zer Katzenstein.
""We need them to bring the hostages back, right now. The only way is through a deal.""
- Settler sanctions -
Violence has also flared in the occupied West Bank, where more than 370 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops and settlers since October 7.
The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on four Israeli settlers over the violence, in a rare US move against Israelis. Any assets they hold in the United States will be blocked, with Americans forbidden from financial transactions with them.""The situation in the West Bank -- in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction -- has reached intolerable levels,"" President Joe Biden said in an executive order laying the groundwork for US actions.
In Syria, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard was killed in an Israel strike south of Damascus, Iranian media reported. Two pro-Iran fighters were also killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said.
Hamas's war with Israel has sparked a surge in attacks by other Iran-backed groups around the region, primarily targeting Israel's Western allies.
Washington has vowed to retaliate for a Sunday drone attack by Iraq-based militants that killed three US soldiers at a base just across the border in neighbouring Jordan.
The deaths marked the first US military losses to hostile fire in the region since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7.
US officials have underlined that they are not seeking a confrontation with Tehran but Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi issued a stern warning Friday against any possible attack.
""We have said many times that we will not be the initiator of any war, but if a country, a cruel force wants to bully, the Islamic Republic of Iran will respond firmly,"" Raisi said.But another, the Al-Nujaba movement, vowed Friday to keep up its campaign. ""Any (US) strike will result in an appropriate response,"" Al-Nujaba leader Akram al-Kaabi said in a statement.

Hundreds more foreign nationals flee Gaza as bombing toll mounts,"GAZA - Hundreds more foreigners and dual nationals fled war-torn Gaza for Egypt Thursday as Israeli forces bombarded and fought ground battles in the besieged Palestinian territory, where thousands have died. 
Egypt said it eventually plans to help evacuate 7,000 foreigners through the Rafah crossing and a spokesman for the Palestinian side of the border post said about 100 had been able to leave Thursday.
A total of 400 foreign passport holders as well as 60 severely wounded Palestinians in ambulances were due to cross by the end of the second day of departures, Wael Abu Mohsen said, and Egyptian officials later reported the first arrivals.A list of those approved to travel Thursday shows hundreds of US citizens and 50 Belgians along with smaller numbers from various European, Arab, Asian and African countries. 
""There was no food, no water, no gas, nowhere to take shelter,"" said US passport holder Salma Shaath, 14, as she prepared to cross. 
""People were going to hospitals to sleep, there are a lot of martyrs, there is no internet, no communications and no electricity. Our house was bombed ... so we came here to Rafah.""The evacuation marks a tiny proportion of the 2.4 million people trapped in Gaza under weeks of bombardment since Hamas launched their bloody cross-border attack into Israel on October 7.
Britain said it had begun sending 30 tonnes of aid to Egypt -- such as forklift trucks, belt conveyors and lighting towers -- to help Rafah process humanitarian aid deliveries faster.  
The evacuations come as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken set off for his second trip to the Middle East since the latest crisis erupted. He will spend Friday in Israel before a trip to Jordan.
US President Joe Biden says the US supports a humanitarian ""pause"" in the conflict to relieve pressure on civilians but opposes calls for a ceasefire.
Ground battles flared again overnight in northern Gaza as Israeli troops have sought to destroy Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the territory. 
The Israeli army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said troops were inside Gaza, besieging Gaza City and ""deepening infiltration"" of Hamas-held areas.
 
- 'Whole families killed' -
 Global concern has risen sharply over Israel's response, in which the army says it has struck more than 12,000 targets so far. 
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 9,000 people have died, mostly women and children.
Special concern has focused on repeated heavy strikes on Gaza's largest refugee camp -- densely populated Jabalia, north of Gaza City -- where explosions brought down residential buildings.Gaza's Hamas-ruled government said 195 were killed in two days of Israeli strikes on Jabalia, with hundreds more missing and wounded, figures AFP could not independently verify.
Hamas said seven of the estimated 242 hostages it is holding, died in Tuesday's bombings, a claim that was also impossible to verify.
Major strikes also hit Gaza's Bureij refugee camp and an area near a UN-run school in Jabalia, where the health ministry said 27 had died.
Outside the Al-Quds hospital in Gaza City, displaced residents seeking shelter from Israeli strikes told AFP that civilians would not withstand the barrage much longer.""This is not a life. We need a safe place for our kids,"" said 50-year-old Hiyam Shamlakh. ""Everybody is terrified, children, women and the elderly.""
Talal Shamlakh, 65, said: ""There have been missiles since 7:00 am around the hospital and we couldn't sleep while children are screaming.""
Another Gazan, Mahmoud Abu Jarad, said civilians would not be able to tolerate another week of strikes. ""We demand a ceasefire. This is the most important thing,"" the 30-year-old said.
 
- 'Death every day' -
 Israel has sought to justify the first Jabalia attack by saying it targeted a senior Hamas commander in a tunnel complex below the camp.
AFP has witnessed rescuers desperately clawing through the rubble and twisted metal in frantic attempts to bring out survivors and bodies.
Emergency responders say ""whole families"" have died.
The wounded were rushed away by cart, motorcycle and ambulance as anguished wails and blaring sirens filled the dusty air.
But Gaza's hospitals have been overwhelmed and run short of medical supplies and even electricity. 
Violence has also flared in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where more than 130 Palestinians have died since October 7 according to the Palestinian health ministry.Three Palestinians were killed Thursday by Israeli fire in the West Bank, the ministry said, and an Israeli was killed in a Palestinian shooting attack, according to first responders.
In embattled Gaza, more than 20,000 people are wounded, according to aid group Doctors Without Borders.
Israel has argued it is trying to avoid civilian casualties and has told residents to evacuate northern Gaza. It also says Hamas has blocked many civilians from leaving to use them as ""human shields"".

Besieged Palestinians await aid trucks as Israel pounds Gaza,"Palestinians in war-torn Gaza on Thursday eagerly awaited aid trucks promised in a deal struck by US President Joe Biden with Egypt and Israel, as the army struck more Hamas targets.
The war -- sparked by the bloody October 7 Hamas attack on Israel that officials said has claimed more than 1,400 lives -- has set off fury across the Middle East against Israel and its Western allies.
The conflict has claimed at least 3,785 lives in the Gaza Strip, its Hamas-controlled health ministry said Thursday, with entire city blocks levelled, water, food and power cut off, and more than one million displaced.
""The pace of death, of suffering, of destruction... cannot be exaggerated,"" UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said about the situation in the crowded territory of 2.4 million people.
There are fears of worse to come if Israel launches an anticipated ground invasion to destroy Hamas and rescue Israeli and foreign hostages, whose known number Israel on Thursday revised up to 203.Biden, on a flying visit to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet on Wednesday, reiterated strong US support for its long-time ally but also stressed the need to address the plight of Palestinian civilians.
He said he had agreed a deal for an initial 20 trucks carrying relief goods to pass through the shuttered Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza, with the first deliveries expected Friday at the earliest.
""We want to get as many of the trucks out as possible,"" Biden told reporters on Air Force One as he flew home, while warning that ""if Hamas confiscates it or doesn't let it get through... then it's going to end"".
Amid the flaring crisis, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres headed to Egypt on Thursday, where President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi also hosted Jordan's King Abdullah II.
The pair, whose countries were the first Arab states to normalise relations with Israel in 1979 and 1994, condemned the ""collective punishment"" of Gazans and warned about the conflict spreading.""If the war does not stop"", it threatens ""to plunge the entire region into catastrophe"", a statement from the Jordanian royal court read.
Sisi and Abdullah -- seen as key mediators between Israel and the Palestinians -- had been due to have four-way talks with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and Biden.
But Amman cancelled the summit.
- Desperate to escape -More than 100 trucks carrying aid goods have been queued for days on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing, the only entry or exit point to Gaza not controlled by Israel.
Cairo has so far kept it closed, pointing to repeated Israeli strikes near the checkpoint and voicing fears that Israel may be hoping to permanently drive Palestinians out and into Egypt's Sinai desert.
On the Gaza side, scores of people were again waiting, desperate to flee, but careful to keep about 100 metres away in case of new Israeli bombardment.
""We're ready with our bags,"" said one man who only gave his name as Mohammed, 40, and who said he works for a European institution.Majed, 43, who said he works with a German organisation, told AFP: ""I came on my own this morning and, in case the crossing opens, I'd get my wife and children -- they're ready.""
- Israel united -
Biden, who was due to address the nation on Thursday about the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts, announced the aid truck deal after what he called ""blunt"" talks in Israel and a phone call with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.Israel consented to the deal while pressing on with its military campaign.
Its army reported Thursday that it had destroyed hundreds more Hamas targets, including missile launch site and tunnels, and that ""more than 10 terrorists were eliminated"".
Israel has stressed it must destroy Hamas after the worst attack on its soil which, the army said Thursday, had claimed 1,403 lives since the surprise onslaught on October 7 including at least 306 soldiers killed in battles to reclaim overrun villages and kibbutzim.Biden, the first US president to visit Israel during war time, strongly backed Israel but warned it not to overreact, cautioning that Washington made mistakes as it sought to avenge 9/11.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Thursday became the latest foreign leader to make a solidarity visit to Israel, meeting Netanyahu and President Isaac Hertzog.
He backed Israeli action but also stressed the need for getting aid into Gaza, before jetting to Saudi Arabia for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Netanyahu called Israel's fight-back a ""just war"", adding: ""I've never seen the people of Israel as united -- more united -- than they are now,"" he said.But intensifying cross-border fire between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon is stoking fears of a potential second front.
As tensions mounted, the United States and UK on Thursday advised their citizens to leave Lebanon while flights were still available.
- Hospital strike -
The Arab world has been united in anger and condemnation of Israel since a deadly strike hit a Gaza hospital compound on Tuesday.Both sides in the war have traded blame for the bloody carnage, but neither the provenance of the strike nor the death toll could be immediately or independently verified.
The strike left scores of bodies and charred cars at the Ahli Arab hospital compound in northern Gaza, AFP images showed.
Hamas accused Israel of hitting the hospital during its massive bombing campaign and Gaza's health ministry put the death toll at 471.
Israel blamed a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket, a claim backed by Biden who said the US Defense Department had concluded that ""it's highly unlikely that it was the Israelis. It would have had a different footprint"".
The Israeli military has pointed to the absence of a large impact crater typical of its air strikes and said fuel from the errant rocket had exploded.
A senior European intelligence source told AFP that he believed a maximum of 50 people were killed.Israeli army spokesman Jonathan Conricus has also disputed Hamas's figure of 471 dead, asking ""where are all the bodies?""
Hamas has dismissed Israel's position, saying its ""outrageous lies do not deceive anyone"".
It also slammed the United States, accusing it of being complicit in the ongoing strikes on Gaza.

Israel pounds Gaza as fears grow of push into Rafah,"RAFAH - Israel pressed its blistering assault in the Gaza Strip on Saturday as fears grew of a push into Rafah, the southern city teeming with civilians uprooted by the nearly four-month war.
A constant barrage of air strikes and tank fire rocked Khan Yunis during the night, an AFP journalist said of the main city in southern Gaza that has been the focus of the Israeli offensive.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said more than 100 people were killed across the Palestinian territory overnight, mostly women and children. The Israeli army said its forces killed ""dozens of terrorists"" in northern and central Gaza over the past 24 hours.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the fierce fighting have fled south to Rafah since the outbreak of the war, with their tents cramming spaces along streets and in parks.
The city that had been home to 200,000 people now hosts more than half of Gaza's 2.4 million population, the World Health Organization said on Friday.
Witnesses in Rafah said 12 people were killed in an air strike on a house owned by the Hijazi family.
Civilians who fled to Rafah have been pushed up against the border with Egypt, trying to avoid parts of the city exposed to the fighting in nearby Khan Yunis.
The United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA said it was deeply concerned about the escalation of hostilities in Khan Yunis, which has pushed more and more people south.",Saturday 03 February 2024 - 12:30pm
Hamas warns Israel Rafah push may cause casualties in 'tens of thousands'," 
JERUSALEM - Gaza's Hamas rulers warned on Saturday that Israel's planned army operation in overcrowded Rafah could cause ""tens of thousands"" of casualties in the city, the last refuge for displaced Palestinians.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the army to set its sights on Rafah. He told military and security officials late Friday to ""submit to the cabinet a combined plan for evacuating the population and destroying the battalions"" of Hamas in the southern city.
Hamas said in a statement that any military action would have catastrophic repercussion that ""may lead to tens of thousands of martyrs and injured if Rafah... is invaded"".Netanyahu's announcement, coming after US President Joe Biden had issued his strongest criticism of Israel's response to the October 7 attack, sparked concern among world leaders and the United Nations.
""The Israeli occupation's move threatens security and peace in the region and the world. This is a blatant violation of all red lines,"" said the office of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borell posted on X, formerly Twitter, Saturday: ""I echo the warning by several EU member states that an Israeli offensive on Rafah would lead to an unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe and grave tensions with Egypt.
""Resuming negotiations to free hostages and suspend hostilities is the only way to avert a bloodshed.""
Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warned ""another bloodbath in Gaza cannot be allowed"", in a post on X.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said he was ""deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah.
""The priority must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out,"" he posted.
 
- Biden frustration -
 
The war in Gaza was sparked by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Vowing to eliminate Hamas, Israel launched a massive military offensive in Gaza that the territory's health ministry says has killed at least 28,064 people, mostly women and children.Militants seized 250 hostages, 132 of whom are still in Gaza although 29 are presumed dead, Israel has said.
The United States is Israel's main international backer, providing it with billions of dollars in military aid.
The US State Department has said it does not support a ground offensive in Rafah, warning that, if not properly planned, such an operation risks ""disaster"".
In a sign of growing frustration, Biden issued his strongest criticism of Israel yet on Thursday, describing the retaliation for Hamas's October 7 attack as ""over the top"".
Biden said there are ""a lot of innocent people who are starving... in trouble and dying, and it's got to stop.""
But Netanyahu's office said it would be ""impossible"" to achieve the war's objective of eliminating Hamas while leaving four of its battalions in Rafah.
 
- Pressure on UNRWA chief -
 
The Israeli military said it had killed two ""senior Hamas operatives"" in an air strike on Rafah Saturday.
It was part of a wider bombardment that killed at least 25 people in the city, according to the health ministry.Israel's military claimed that troops had uncovered a Hamas tunnel under the evacuated Gaza City headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called for its head, Philippe Lazzarini, to quit.
Lazzarini said the agency had not operated from the compound since October 12 when staff evacuated it under instruction from Israeli forces.Already under pressure after Israel claimed 12 UNRWA staff were involved in the October 7 Hamas attack, he called for an independent investigation into the latest Israeli accusations.
An AFP photographer was among a number of journalists taken to the compound and tunnel by the Israeli military on Thursday.
UN premises are considered ""inviolable"" in international law and immune from ""search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation and any other form of interference"".
Hamas has repeatedly denied Israeli accusations that it has dug a network of tunnels under schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure as cover for its activities.
 
- 'Between life and death' -
 
Fears are mounting over the fate of more than one million displaced Palestinians who have taken shelter in Rafah, many of them in plastic tents pushed up against the border with Egypt.
""We are between life and death,"" said one of them, Bassel Matar. ""We don't know if there will be hope tomorrow for a truce or there will be changes on the ground.""Rafah is the last major population centre in the Gaza Strip that Israeli troops have yet to enter and also the main point of entry for desperately needed relief supplies.
Humanitarian organisations have expressed alarm at the prospect of a ground incursion.
The UN children's fund, UNICEF, warned this week that ""thousands more could die in the violence or lack of essential services"".
Netanyahu announced the plan for a ground operation in Rafah only days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Israel seeking a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange.
The impact of the war has been felt widely, with violence involving Iran-backed allies of Hamas surging across the Middle East.And in Syria, Israeli strikes near Damascus killed three people, a war monitor said, adding the targeted neighbourhood hosted villas for top military and civilian officials.

Gaza-Israel conflict: Opportunity and risk for Russia's Putin,"The conflict between Hamas and Israel is both an opportunity and a risk for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been mired in pressing his invasion of Ukraine for the past 19 months.
Here is an overview of five of Putin's objectives that are expected to shape his foreign policy:
- Divert attention from Ukraine -
The crisis in the Middle East has diverted international attention from Ukraine, which has battled to repel Russia's invasion for more than 600 days.
""The Hamas raid and its consequences actually contribute to the erosion of general Western interest in Ukraine,"" wrote Igor Delanoe, deputy director of the Franco-Russian Observatory think tank.
Alexander Gabuev, the Berlin-based director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said he expected senior US officials such as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan to spend much of their time on the Middle East crisis in the coming months.
""This conflict is a boon for Russia because it diverts a huge amount of attention of the United States and the West,"" Gabuev told AFP.
- Avoid chaos -
The Middle East has traditionally been a region of huge importance to Russia and it has contacts with Palestinian groups including Hamas and often thorny ties with Israel in a complex relationship going back to the Soviet era.
Hanna Notte, an analyst at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said she had not seen any evidence of ""direct Russian backing for Hamas and this attack - planning, weapons, execution.""
""And to be clear: there was no need for Russian assistance,"" she added.
Tatiana Stanovaya, head of R.Politik, a political analysis firm based in France, said that an escalation in the region leading to a conflict between Iran and Israel ""could jeopardise Russia's established presence in the Middle East and its long, ongoing campaign in Syria.""
Russia's military bases in Syria are an important hub and help project ""Moscow's influence in Africa as well as the Middle East,"" Stanovaya added.
- Deal with Iran -
The tightening of ties between Tehran and Moscow has become one of key objectives of Russian diplomacy given the massive use of Iranian drones in Ukraine by the Russian army.
But the rapprochement is not without risks as the Islamic Republic is a top backer of both Hamas and Hezbollah. 
""Russia's war in Ukraine has driven closer military ties with Iran. Hamas officials have visited Moscow at least three times since Russia invaded Ukraine,"" said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
""The question has always been how far such cooperation could go without causing (Israel) to rethink its ties with Moscow. Moscow must also fear that a severe retaliation against Iran could weaken one of its few close allies.""
- Accomodate Israel -
At the same time, Moscow must manage a careful balancing act in its ties with Israel, especially given the strong personal relations between Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a frequent guest in Russia.
Israel has refrained from sending any weapons to Ukraine following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""The Kremlin has so far succeeded in keeping (Israel) out of the war in Ukraine, and would like this Western country not to be an additional supporter of Ukraine,"" said Dimitri Minic of the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI).
But Putin conspicuously refrained from using the word ""terrorist"" to describe the Hamas attacks.
That stance is indicative of Moscow's ""changed political priorities and of the extent to which Russian messaging now caters to pro-Palestinian constituencies in the Middle East and across the Global South,"" said Notte.
- Weaken the West -
Putin says he wants to shape a new world order together with China as well as Moscow allies in Iran and North Korea.
The Kremlin chief has openly blamed Washington for the turmoil in the Middle East. 
Stanovaya said that the crisis ""helps to fan anti-Western narratives by attributing general global instability and the reopening of historic disputes to the West.""
Minic of IFRI noted that some countries in the so-called Global South and Russia were united in their ""resentment, even hatred and very often an irrational perception of the West.""
""And this relationship with the West has a number of sources which form an inexhaustible breeding ground for Moscow.""

"UN experts decry killing, silencing of journalists in Gaza","UN rights experts voiced alarm Thursday at soaring numbers of journalists killed in the Gaza war, decrying an apparent ""deliberate"" Israeli strategy to silence critical reporting.
""Rarely have journalists paid such a heavy price for just doing their job as those in Gaza now,"" the five experts said in a statement.
United Nations reports indicate that at least 122 journalists and other media workers have been killed and many others injured in the Gaza Strip since war erupted there following Hamas's deadly attacks inside Israel on October 7.
The Palestinian militants also killed four Israeli journalists on October 7, while three journalists have been killed by Israeli shelling on the Lebanese side of their border.
""We are alarmed at the extraordinarily high numbers of journalists and media workers who have been killed, attacked, injured and detained in the occupied Palestinian territory, particularly in Gaza, in recent months,"" the experts said.
The independent experts, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council but do not speak on behalf of the United Nations, said they had received ""disturbing reports that, despite being clearly identifiable in jackets and helmets marked 'press' or travelling in well-marked press vehicles, journalists have come under attack"".
This, they warned, ""would seem to indicate that the killings, injury, and detention are a deliberate strategy by Israeli forces to obstruct the media and silence critical reporting"".
""Targeted attacks and killings of journalists are war crimes."" 
The experts, including the special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, on rights in the Palestinian territories and on extrajudicial executions, also voiced grave concerns that Israel has refused to let media from outside Gaza to enter and report unless they are embedded with Israeli forces.
""The attacks on media in Gaza and restrictions on other journalists from accessing Gaza, combined with severe disruptions of the internet, are major impediments to the right of information of the people of Gaza as well as the outside world,"" they said.
They also urged international courts to pay particular attention to this ""dangerous pattern of attacks and impunity for crimes against journalists"". 
The war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza including at least 29 people believed to have been killed.
Israel has responded with a withering air, land and sea offensive that has killed more than 27,000 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
AFP journalists recently held a global show of support for the agency's journalists in Gaza who have not been allowed to leave since the war started.

Mediators seek Gaza truce as US calls for 'immediate ceasefire'," 
JERUSALEM - Mediators in Cairo pushed on Monday with efforts towards a Gaza truce after Israel's top ally the United States stepped up pressure for a halt in fighting and more aid to enter the besieged Palestinian territory.
Bombardment and combat claimed 124 more lives within 24 hours, said the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory which has been devastated and gripped by dire food shortages in the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attacks.
Qatari and Egyptian mediators met with US and Hamas envoys -- but no Israeli delegates so far -- in Cairo for a second day of talks aiming for a halt in fighting before the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan starts on March 10 or 11.
An Egyptian TV channel linked to the intelligence service reported ""significant progress"" towards a truce deal without giving any more details, while a Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the talks were continuing.The plan on the table aims for a six-week truce, the exchange of scores of remaining hostages for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and for more aid to enter Gaza -- but sticking points remain.
Hamas wants Israel to withdraw all forces, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted the army will finish its campaign to destroy Hamas, including in far-southern Rafah where about 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering.
Israel has also demanded a list of all remaining captives. Israel has said it believes 130 of the original 250 captives taken by Hamas remain in Gaza, but that 31 have been killed.
US Vice President Kamala Harris called on Sunday for the six-week truce deal to be accepted, while criticising Israel in unusually strong language over insufficient aid deliveries into Gaza.""Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table,"" she said in a speech in Selma, Alabama.
""Hamas claims it wants a ceasefire,"" she said. ""Well, there is a deal on the table. And, as we have said, Hamas needs to agree to that deal.""
The vice president also stressed that Gazans are starving and that conditions are ""inhumane"" and demanded the Netanyahu government ""must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses."" 
 
- Gantz in Washington -
 Her comments come as President Joe Biden faces acute pressure in an election year over his steadfast support for Israel and Gaza's soaring civilian death toll, which the health ministry there put at 30,534, mostly women and children.
Harris as well as Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, were later set to meet Israel's former military chief Benny Gantz in Washington.
Gantz is a member of Netanyahu's war cabinet -- but also a centrist political rival of the right-wing veteran premier, whom he harshly criticised before the war.In a sign of political divisions, Gantz's US visit was criticised by Doudi Amsellem, minister of regional cooperation, in a post on social media platform X that said: ""Mr Gantz, your entry into government was intended to create unity at a time of emergency, not to be a Trojan horse"".
Amid the crisis diplomacy, the Gaza conflict ground on unabated, with witnesses reporting clashes in Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood and the main southern city of Khan Yunis. 
Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas after its unprecedented attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of around 1,160 people, according to an AFP tally of official figures.The Hamas government media office said ""dozens of air strikes"" and ""intense artillery shelling"" hit areas across Gaza.
The Israeli military said it carried out ""targeted raids"" in the Khan Yunis area, killed ""15 terrorists"" over the past day, and detained dozens of suspects linked to Palestinian armed groups.
 
- 'Powder keg' -
 Gaza's hunger crisis came into stark relief last Thursday when more than 100 Palestinians were killed in chaotic and bloody scenes around a convoy of aid trucks in Gaza City.
Gaza health officials said Israeli forces opened fire into the crowd, while Israel's army said most victims were trampled to death or hit by trucks in a crush for food.
The UN Security Council voiced concern over Gaza's ""alarming levels of acute food insecurity"" and urged ""the immediate, rapid, safe, sustained and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale"".
Palestinian families have told AFP of grinding up animal feed and foraged plants, while the health ministry said at least 16 children have died of malnutrition in Gaza's aid-deprived north.Blinken said on X that ""it is imperative that we expand the flow of aid into Gaza to alleviate the dire humanitarian situation"".
A Hamas official has said the group wants the truce deal to include ""the entry of at least 400 to 500 trucks per day"" carrying food, medicine and fuel.
Witnesses told AFP that an Israeli strike hit an aid truck in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah on Sunday, killing several people.
The Israeli military denied the claim and told AFP: ""It was not an aid truck that was struck.""
It issued a statement saying a Hamas militant responsible for recruiting and fund-raising was travelling inside the truck and ""was eliminated in an aerial strike"".The Gaza war has sparked violence across the region, drawing in Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, whose Huthi rebels have attacked shipping off its coast.
UN human rights chief Volker Turk warned that the war ""has already generated dangerous spillover in neighbouring countries, and I am deeply concerned that in this powder keg, any spark could lead to a much broader conflagration"". 
""This would have implications for every country in the Middle East and many beyond it,"" Turk said in his global update to the United Nations Human Rights Council.

"Families of Gaza hostages, Palestinian prisoners torn between emotions","Israeli and Palestinian families were torn between hope and fear Wednesday following an overnight deal to free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. 
Under the terms of the deal, Palestinian militants will release 50 hostages, all women and children kidnapped during the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, in exchange for the freeing of 150 Palestinian prisoners, made up of women and teenagers.
But beyond the fact they would be released at a ratio of three prisoners for every hostage, little is known about how and when they would be freed -- although it will happen during a four-day pause in the fighting.
Israel has published a list of 300 prisoner names eligible for release, but no such information has been released by Hamas, sparking a welter of emotions on both sides. 
""We are very happy that a partial release is pending,"" said the Hostages and Missing Families Forum which represents the 240 or so people snatched on October 7, among them women, children and elderly people. 
""As of now, we don't know exactly who will be released when.""There are at least 35 children among the hostages, 18 of them aged 10 and under, according to an AFP count, as well as more than 50 women. 
""We don't know who will get out because Hamas will release the names every evening of those who will get out the next day,"" said Gilad Korngold, whose eight-year-old grandson Naveh and granddaughter Yahel, three, are among seven family members held captive. 
""We don't know anything but we have to stay at home. That's what they told us,"" he told AFP, the tension evident in his voice.
""Until I see them with my own eyes, I won't believe what anyone says.""
The most prominent Palestinian prisoner on the Israeli list is Israa Jaabis, 38, who was convicted of blowing up a gas cylinder in her car at a checkpoint in 2015, wounding a police officer. She was sentenced to 11 years in prison.
Her sister Muna told AFP that even though she was named in the document, the family did not know ""whether they could release her and deport her, or what her fate will be"".
And the violence of the Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip meant their emotions were mixed, she added.
""We try to accept the idea that all these detainees were released after thousands were killed, but it is difficult and the joy is stained with blood.""
- 'Pain in my heart' -
The hostages have become a focal point of Israel's massive military campaign in Gaza after Hamas militants stormed across the border on October 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians and snatching hundreds of others in the worst attack in Israel's 75-year history. 
Since then, Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and hit Gaza relentlessly, with the Hamas-run government saying more than 14,000 people have been killed, two thirds of them women and children. 
One Palestinian mother from annexed east Jerusalem said she was delighted her daughter was coming home after serving half of her 16-year sentence in an Israeli jail, but admitted she had ""mixed feelings"" over the high price that secured her release.
""I cry, laugh, and tremble... I had hoped that she would come out in a deal, and this year I kept imagining her walking through the front door,"" Sameera Dwayyat said of her 26-year-old daughter Shruq. 
""At the same time, there is great pain in my heart. I wish she had been sentenced for 10 more years and we hadn't lost a single child in Gaza.""
On the list of prisoners slated for release are 33 women, 123 boys under 18, and 144 young men aged 18. All are from the occupied West Bank or east Jerusalem and none had ""blood on their hands"", Israel has said. 
In Tel Aviv, supporters of the hostage families expressed relief at the breakthrough but shared deeply mixed feelings that the deal did not involve all those who had been abducted.
""We are happy for everyone who is being released, but we're still thinking about all the people who are left behind,"" 42-year-old teacher Marva Tovia told AFPTV. 
""It's really heartbreaking, I feel torn.""",Wednesday 22 November 2023 - 14:45pm
Israel intensifies Gaza strikes despite ceasefire calls,"JERUSALEM - Israel on Monday pounded Gaza with ""significant"" strikes as soldiers battled Hamas forces in the besieged territory, ignoring ceasefire calls by UN aid agencies who condemned surging civilian deaths in the month-long conflict.
Israeli troops and Hamas fighters engaged in house-to-house combat in densely populated Gaza, where the war has sent 1.5 million people fleeing to other parts of the territory in a desperate search for cover.
""We will take the fight to Hamas wherever they are, underground, above ground"", Israeli army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said at a briefing Monday, repeating calls for civilians to leave the urban war zone in the north of the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.
""We will be able to dismantle Hamas, stronghold after stronghold, battalion after battalion, until we achieve the ultimate goal, which is to rid the Gaza Strip -- the entire Gaza Strip -- of Hamas.""
Conricus again accused Hamas of building tunnels underneath hospitals, schools and places of worship in Gaza to hide fighters, plan attacks and store ammunition -- a charge the militant group has repeatedly denied.
""This strike is like an earthquake,"" Gaza City resident Alaa Abu Hasera said, in a devastated area where entire blocks were reduced to rubble.
Israel launched a massive bombing campaign after the Palestinian militants staged the worst attack in the country's history.
In their October 7 attack, Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 240 others hostage.
The health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, says more than 9,770 people, many of them women and children, have been killed in Israeli strikes and the intensifying ground campaign since the war began.
Israel has resisted calls for a halt in the fighting, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken touring the region calling for ""pauses"" while rejecting Arab countries' demands for a ceasefire.
Israeli troops now encircle Gaza City, effectively splitting the territory in two, with ""significant"" strikes carried out, army spokesman Daniel Hagari said late Sunday.
Shortly before the strikes, internet and telephone lines were cut, Hagari said, adding that the strikes would continue in the days to come.",Monday 06 November 2023 - 09:30am
Biden to visit Israel as Gaza ground invasion looms,"WASHINGTON - US President Joe Biden will visit Israel Wednesday in a show of ""ironclad"" support as Washington tries to prevent the escalating war against Hamas in Gaza from spilling into a wider Middle East conflict.
Anger and bloodshed have surged as the war has claimed thousands of lives since the Islamist attack, with most of the dead on both sides civilians.Biden's trip will come 12 days after the Palestinian militants of Hamas burst through Israel's heavily fortified Gaza border, killing, mutilating and burning more than 1,400 people.
Shell-shocked Israel has responded with withering air strikes that have killed more than 2,700 people. It has also imposed a crippling siege on Gaza and deployed tens of thousands of troops in preparation for a full-scale ground offensive.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas while also seeking to rescue the at least 199 hostages taken into Gaza by Hamas, which has released a video of one of the captives, French-Israeli woman Mia Shem.Her mother, Keren Shem, made an emotional plea for her safe return, at a Tel Aviv press conference.
""I ask world leaders that my daughter be returned to us in the state that she is today, as well as the other hostages,"" she said.
""I am begging the world to bring my baby back home.""
 
- Iran warning -
 
Army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said Tuesday that Israeli forces ""will commence the enhanced military activities when the timing suits the goal"".He stressed that ""if hostages are dead, that is the responsibility of Hamas and Hamas will pay the price"", with the army later announcing the killing of a senior Hamas commander, Ayman Nofal.
Israelis are still reeling from the worst attack in the country's 75-year history, which has sparked a mass mobilisation of reservists and the evacuation of about 500,000 people from areas near Gaza and Lebanon.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, back in Israel after a whistlestop regional tour, said Biden's visit would be a statement of ""solidarity with Israel"" and an ""ironclad commitment to its security"".
Washington has already sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean ""to deter hostile actions against Israel"".
The Pentagon has put 2,000 troops on deployment alert to be able ""to respond quickly to the evolving security environment in the Middle East"". US media said the troops would cover support roles such as medical assistance and handling explosives.Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tuesday that ""no one can stop"" forces opposed to Israel if it keeps up its bombardment of Gaza.
Deadly flare-ups have rocked Israel's northern border with Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement is based.
Israel's army said Tuesday it had killed four militants attempting to infiltrate from Lebanon, the latest in a series of incidents.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby was asked on CNN whether US authorities had so far noticed Iran engaging in the conflict in new ways.
""Outside of the rhetoric..., no we haven't,"" he replied.
 
- 'Corpses in the streets' -
 While signalling support, Biden will also try to quietly steer Israeli's military response, as international alarm has grown about the devastating impact of the war on Palestinian civilians.
At least 2,750 Palestinians -- mostly civilians -- have been killed, entire neighbourhoods have been razed and survivors are left with dwindling supplies of food, water and fuel.
""The situation is catastrophic beyond what I could have imagined,"" said Jamil Abdullah, a Palestinian-Swede, hoping to flee the blockaded enclave.
""There are corpses in the streets. Buildings are crashing down on their inhabitants. Blood is everywhere. The smell of the dead is everywhere.""AFP reporters in Gaza said mortuaries were overflowing, and corpses wrapped in white body bags were even being stored in an ice cream truck.
""Enough!"" cried Moamed Abu Zaid, counting about 20 family members killed in one strike. ""How long will this continue for?""
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says more than one million Palestinians -- almost half of Gaza's population of 2.4 million -- have fled their homes.
World Health Organization regional director Ahmed Al-Mandhari told AFP that Gaza was barrelling towards ""real catastrophe"".
Israel has demanded that residents of north Gaza leave for the south, hoping to clear the area of civilians in preparation for a ground assault that would involve gruelling urban combat.
 
- No escape -
 Since Israel's evacuation order in north Gaza, entire families, young children and the elderly have gathered belongings and fled to southern Gaza, bedding down in any available space, indoors and out.
Egypt kept closed Gaza's only border crossing not controlled by Israel, Rafah, meaning there is no escape.
Israel has repeatedly struck the area on the Palestinian side and  denied reports of any temporary ceasefire deal to open it.Rafah's closure has so far prevented the escape of thousands of Palestinian-Americans and others hoping to get out of Gaza, or the entry of relief goods now loaded on truck convoys waiting in Egypt.
For now Gazans remain trapped, with neighbouring Arab nations also fearful that if Palestinians leave the territory they could be permanently exiled.
Blinken, after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, signalled there was no agreement yet on humanitarian relief, but said there was a ""commitment"" to work on a plan ahead of and during Biden's visit.
Blinken said the US president hopes to ""hear from Israel how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimises civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not benefit Hamas.""

Hamas fighters free first wave of hostages in Gaza truce,"GAZA CITY - Masked Hamas gunmen freed a first wave of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, sparking rare scenes of celebration in a seven-week war that has killed thousands of people.
During a carefully orchestrated swap carried out at the start of a four-day ceasefire, Israelis beeped horns and applauded in the street as ambulances took the hostages to hospital for check-ups in the late evening, AFP video images showed.
Hamas released 24 hostages in total, all women and children, according to key mediator Qatar and an official Israeli list. They comprised 13 Israelis, some of them dual citizens, 10 Thais and one Filipino citizen.
Israel in turn freed 39 women and children from its prisons.
A two-minute video released by Hamas showed masked militants with rifles, wearing military fatigues and the green headband of its armed wing, as they handed hostages over to Red Cross officials.
The captives had been in Hamas' hands since its fighters smashed through Gaza's militarised border with Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and seizing around 240 Israelis and foreigners, according to Israel.
Among the freed hostages, four children and four women were admitted to Schneider Children's Medical Centre. 
Their physical condition is ""good"" and they will undergo a medical and psychological assessment, the hospital's chief executive, Efrat Bron-Harlev, said.",Saturday 25 November 2023 - 06:28am
Israel pressed on two-state solution as forces hammer south Gaza,"GAZA - Gazans sheltered Monday from intense bombing and shooting in the city of Khan Yunis, as pressure built on Israel for an eventual two-state solution involving statehood long sought by Palestinians.
Witnesses reported deadly strikes and fierce fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas militants overnight in the southern city which has become the latest epicentre of the war.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza reported on Monday that more than 120 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours.
""Artillery shelling has not stopped since 5:00 am,"" said Yunis Abdel Razek, 52, sheltering with his family at the city's Al-Aqsa University.
Mahdi Antar, 21, had sought refuge at Al-Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis. 
""The situation is terrifying. Tonight and today are very difficult, bombing and shooting. I do not know what to do. I think they will storm the hospital,"" he said.Victims of the latest Israeli strikes were brought to the hospital, at least one on a hand-pulled cart.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli forces were ""besieging"" their ambulance centre ""and targeting anyone attempting to move in the area"".
At one building that had been hit, men walked over broken concrete with only torches casting a dusty light to help them search in the darkness for survivors.
The strikes came as European Union foreign ministers held meetings in Brussels with top diplomats from the warring sides and key Arab states.
 
- Condemnation, defiance -
 
The 27 EU ministers first met Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz before sitting down separately with the Palestinian Authority's top diplomat, Riyad al-Maliki.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told Israel ""peace and stability cannot be built only by military means"".  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has drawn condemnation from the United Nations and defied the United States, which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, by rejecting calls for a Palestinian state. 
Maliki demanded the EU call for an immediate ceasefire and urged the bloc to consider sanctions against Netanyahu for ""destroying the chances for a two-state solution"".
Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said ""the whole world"" sees a two-state solution as ""the only way out of this misery"".
Katz told reporters he was in Brussels to discuss the need ""to bring back our hostages and restore security for the citizens of Israel"".
The talks came a day after Hamas issued a 16-page report, in Arabic and English, explaining the background to the October 7 attacks against southern Israel which sparked the war.It called the attacks a ""defensive act"" and ""necessary step"" against Israeli occupation, ""reclaiming the Palestinian rights and on the way for liberation and independence like all peoples"".
The attacks resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
In response, Israel has carried out a relentless offensive that has killed at least 25,295 people in Gaza, around 70 percent of them women, young children and adolescents, according to the latest toll issued Monday by Gaza's health ministry.
 
- Parliamentary committee stormed -
 
US intelligence agencies have estimated that the Israeli campaign has killed ""around 20 percent to 30 percent"" of Hamas fighters and is still far from its goal of destroying the Islamist movement, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
In a video statement issued after the Hamas report, Netanyahu said ""our soldiers have fallen in vain"" and security would not be guaranteed if Israel accepted Hamas's demands for the release of hostages.
These included ending the war, withdrawing Israeli forces from Gaza, releasing Palestinian prisoners and guaranteeing that Hamas would stay in power, he said.Netanyahu is under intense pressure to return the captives and account for security failings surrounding the October 7 attacks.
Hamas militants seized about 250 hostages and Israel says around 132 remain in Gaza. This includes the bodies of at least 28 dead hostages, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli data.
Relatives and supporters of the captives have held regular rallies and on Monday upped their pressure by storming a parliamentary finance committee meeting, where they shouted and brandished signs.
In a bid to secure a new hostage exchange deal, US media said the United States coordinator for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, was due to meet top officials in Cairo on Monday, followed by a trip to Qatar.The three countries helped broker a one-week truce in late November that saw 80 hostages freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israel.
Rising tensions and violence across the Middle East -- involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen -- have stoked fears of a wider conflagration.

Israel sends troops into 'besieged' Gaza hospital,"Israel sent troops into a hospital in war-torn Gaza on Thursday where it said hostages may have been held, as medics warned the key medical facility was operating in ""near impossible"" conditions.
The raid came after days of intense fighting between troops and Hamas militants around the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis -- one of the largest medical sites in southern Gaza, and one of the few hospitals that are still operational in the territory.Israel, which has accused Hamas militants of using hospitals for military purposes, said it was carrying out a ""precise and limited operation"" at the facility with ""no obligation"" for patients or staff to evacuate.
Israeli army spokesman Rear-Admiral Daniel Hagari said there was ""credible intelligence from a number of sources, including from released hostages, indicating that Hamas held hostages at the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis and that there may be bodies of our hostages"" at the hospital.
The health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza has reported that thousands of people who had sought refuge at the hospital, including patients, have been made to leave in recent days.It has called the situation at Nasser ""catastrophic"", with staff unable to move bodies to the morgue because of the risks involved.
Nurse Mohammed al-Astal told AFP this week that the facility had been ""besieged"" for a month and was facing deadly sniper fire, sewage in the emergency room, and a lack of drinking water.
Doctors Without Borders has warned its staff there are continuing to treat patients ""amid near impossible conditions"".
 
- Gaza pounded -
 
The World Health Organization has described Nasser hospital as a critical facility ""for all of Gaza"", where only a minority of hospitals are even partly operational.The army, citing intelligence estimates and information from the ground, said ""over 85 percent of major medical facilities in Gaza have been used by Hamas for terror operations"".
Roughly 130 hostages are still believed to be in Gaza after the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Dozens of the estimated 250 hostages seized during the attack were freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during a week-long truce in November. Israel says 29 of those still in Gaza are presumed dead.Israel launched more deadly strikes on southern Gaza on Thursday, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted it would push ahead with a ""powerful"" operation in the overcrowded city of Rafah for ""complete victory"".
AFP photographs show thick black smoke billowing into the sky over Khan Yunis, as Israeli bombardments continue.
 
- 'No safe place' -
 
Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven into Rafah, seeking shelter in a sprawling makeshift encampment near the Egyptian border.""We were displaced from Gaza City to the south,"" said Ahlam Abu Assi. ""(Then) they told us to go to Rafah, so we went to Rafah.
""We can't keep going and coming,"" she added. ""There is no safe place for us.""
Australia, Canada and New Zealand were the latest to warn Israel not to launch a ground offensive in Rafah, issuing a joint statement saying it would be ""devastating"" for the 1.5 million Palestinians trapped there.
""There is simply nowhere else for civilians to go,"" they said.In Cairo, efforts to secure a ceasefire entered a third day, with negotiators from the United States, Qatar and Egypt trying to broker a deal to suspend the fighting and see the release of the remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
CIA director William Burns joined the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence service for talks with mediators on Tuesday, while a Hamas delegation was in Cairo Wednesday.
But there was no sign of immediate progress.
 
- 'War in the north' -
 
Netanyahu's office said it did not receive ""any new proposal"" from Hamas about releasing hostages, and Israeli media reported that the country's delegation was not to return to negotiations until Hamas softens its stance.While he did not comment directly on the reports, Netanyahu said: ""I insist that Hamas drop their delusional demands, and when they drop these demands we can move forward.""
Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas, who governs the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has urged Hamas to ""rapidly"" agree to a truce and stave off further tragedy for Palestinians.
Meanwhile a reported peace plan was slammed by two powerful Israeli far-right ministers on Thursday, who said they would ""in no way agree"".
The Washington Post said US President Joe Biden's administration and a small group of Arab allies were working out a comprehensive plan for long-term peace which included setting out a timeline for creating a Palestinian state.
With regional tensions high, the Israeli army said rocket fire from Lebanon Wednesday killed an Israeli soldier, while Lebanese sources said Israeli strikes had killed 15 people, 10 of them civilians.
A security source in Lebanon said Thursday the dead included Hezbollah commander Ali al-Debs and two other Hezbollah fighters.But the worst single-day civilian death toll in Lebanon since October raised fears of a broader conflict between Israel and militant group Hezbollah.
After meeting commanders near the Lebanese border, Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi said Israel is ""now focused on being ready for war in the north"".",Thursday 15 February 2024 - 14:40pm
Israelis reservists thrust into unknown on frontlines of war with Hamas,"BEIT KAMA - An earring pokes out from under the helmet of Israeli army reservist Amir, a self-professed leftist who is pro-peace but finds himself looking through his rifle scope at buildings inside Gaza.
""It's surreal to be here"", said Amir, one of more than 360,000 Israeli reservists called up for the war against Gaza-based Hamas militants.
Civilians one day, men and women like Amir become soldiers the next.
Under camouflage only 1.5 kilometres (one mile) from the Palestinian enclave, Amir who did not give his last name according to army orders -- finished his military service in 2014, just after an earlier Israeli war with militants in Gaza. 
He said meekly that he still has ""grief and trauma"" from that conflict, and despite undergoing annual training exercises, he didn't ""realise"" that -- nine years later -- he'd be called to fight again.
""No one should have to find themselves in this situation"", he said, holding his rifle.
""I still know how to use it, but I hope I don't have to"", he sighed.
Behind him, his platoon, a group of reservists who didn't know each other, practise the basics of tactical movement while camouflaged on the ground, communicating silently through hand signs.Most Israelis who have already done their mandatory military service remain in the reserves until age 40. 
In Amir's unit, like many across Israel, older volunteers have also decided to come back into service since the beginning of the war on October 7, when Palestinian Hamas militants broke through the militarised border barrier around Gaza and attacked southern Israel.
They gunned down, stabbed and burned more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
Israel is preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza but has for days been dropping thousands of munitions on targets in the coastal strip, levelling entire neighbourhoods, where at least 2,750 people, most of them ordinary Palestinians, have been killed.
Israel's reserves supplement the 169,500 military personnel under contract -- both mandatory service and career soldiers. 
 
- Terrifying -
 
Elia, 24, is a female reservist, a medic who hasn't worn a uniform in four years. 
The French-Israeli, who works in a startup, found out that she had been called up for service while she was on a beach in Thailand.
""Even for us, it's terrifying. Of course I'm asking myself what I'm doing here, but this is just how it is. It's our duty"", she told AFP, with a medical bag on her back.
Since the last week, at least 258 Israeli soldiers have been killed in fighting, the army said.
At a rest stop in Beit Kama, one of the last stops before Gaza, the scene is colourful as the transformation from civilian to soldier takes place. Dreadlocks hang from under helmets. There are hipster beards, quirky glasses, oversize pants hanging down below the waist, and hiking shoes that are anything but regulation.While the army dress code is extremely rigid, and a source of punishment for soldiers who deviate from the right sock colour to the texture of a hair scrunchie, the reservists ""come as they are"", a military police officer near Gaza explained to AFP.
In Israel, flipping from civilian to military life happens via text message or phone call.
Since October 7, entire planes have been chartered to bring home reservists and other Israelis.
The extent of the mobilisation can be seen in the two kilometre line of cars parked along the highway passing one of the largest bases in the country, near Jerusalem.
To support their loved ones, the home front is increasing donations: food, equipment, camping material, and even free hair cuts. But the army reminded over-eager donors that tactical or combat equipment is its responsibility.

Moroccan protesters decry Gaza 'genocide',"MOROCCO - Several thousand Moroccans demonstrated on Sunday in Rabat to condemn ""genocide"" in the Gaza Strip and demand the end of diplomatic relations with Israel, AFP journalists reported.
They marched through the city behind a huge banner denouncing ""the Holocaust in Gaza"" and calling for ties with Israel to be repealed.
Morocco and Israel established full relations in 2020 in exchange for the United States recognising Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed territory of Western Sahara.
On Sunday, demonstrators waving Palestinian flags and wearing keffiyeh scarves marched against ""war crimes and genocide"" in Gaza, and calling for an end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories.
The demonstration was organised by the ""National Action Group for Palestine"", a coalition of leftist parties and Islamists.
Protester Saoussane, 41, said she was there ""to express support for the Palestinian people, and for the children they are killing who have nothing to do with Hamas"".
""How can we talk about collateral damage with 17,000 dead?"" she asked. ""It is genocide -- it is not even a war any more.""
According the Hamas health ministry in Gaza, 17,997 people have been killed by Israel's relentless air strikes and ground invasion, mostly women and children.
In retaliation for Hamas's unprecedented attack on October 7 in the south of Israel, which killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and in which they took 240 hostages, Israel's military launched a campaign to ""annihilate"" Hamas. Since the war began, huge demonstrations across Morocco have called for an end to the North African country's diplomatic normalisation with Israel, whereas before October 7 opposition to normalisation was limited.
""Gaza, under siege for 17 years, is experiencing the worst genocide with the blessing of the United Nations which is unable to take firm decisions to stop it, with the participation of the United States and Western countries"", said another demonstrator, Halima Chouika.
At the end of November, Morocco's King Mohammed VI condemned Israel's ""flagrant violation of international law and humanitarian values"" in its reprisals against Hamas.
He said he rejected Israel's ""policy of collective punishment, forced displacement and any attempt to impose new facts on the ground"", in a message addressed to the United Nations.",Sunday 10 December 2023 - 18:50pm
Deadly chaos at Gaza aid distribution as WHO renews hospital warning,"GAZA CITY - An aid delivery in Gaza descended into chaos on Saturday with shots fired and a Red Crescent paramedic reporting five dead, as almost six months of Israeli bombardment has left hundreds of thousands in desperate need.
Israel's siege, sparked by a deadly militant attack on October 7, brings nightly air strikes and in recent days major operations around several hospitals, which it says are used by Palestinian militant groups -- claims denied by Hamas.
The World Health Organization warned that Gaza had just 10 ""minimally functioning"" hospitals for its more than two million people, with its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying around 9,000 patients urgently needed treatment abroad.
UN agencies have warned repeatedly that northern Gaza is on the verge of famine and called it a man-made crisis because aid lorries are backed up on the Egypt-Gaza border awaiting long checks by Israeli officials. Israel has denied responsibility.
Two charities have organised aid deliveries by sea from Cyprus, with their second mission in just over two weeks setting sail on Saturday.
 Organisers said the flotilla, which had been repeatedly delayed by bad weather, was carrying around 400 tonnes of supplies, a fraction of Gaza's needs.
The top UN court has ordered Israel to allow in aid and the UN Security Council has adopted a resolution demanding an ""immediate ceasefire"" but neither has affected the situation on the ground.
Israel and Hamas have been unable to agree a truce in indirect talks in Qatar, with each side blaming the other.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave the go-ahead Friday for a new round of talks with negotiators expected to resume their work on Monday.
Witnesses told AFP shots were fired both by Gazans overseeing the aid delivery and Israeli troops nearby, and panicked lorry drivers drove quickly away, hitting people trying to get the food. The Israeli military told AFP it had ""no record of the incident described"".
Aid deliveries have become increasingly fraught as the needs of Gazans increase.",Sunday 31 March 2024 - 07:28am
Gaza battles rage as Israel vows to shut out UN agency after war,"Intense fighting raged Saturday in the Gaza city of Khan Yunis, the main theatre of conflict where the Israeli army is targeting the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas.
The unabated hostilities came a day after the UN's International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled Israel must prevent possible acts of genocide in the conflict but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.
Tensions rose between Israel and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees after Israel alleged several UNRWA staff were involved in the Hamas attack of October 7, leading some key donor countries to suspend funding.Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Saturday that Israel wants to ensure the UN agency, with tens of thousands of staff in the territory, ""will not be a part of the day after"" the bloodiest ever Gaza war.
Alarm has grown over the plight of civilians in Khan Yunis, the southern hometown of Hamas's Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar, the suspected mastermind of the October 7 attack.
AFPTV images showed thousands of civilians, among them women and children, fleeing the city on foot as an Israeli tank loomed behind them.
""They besieged us, so we fled,"" said Tahani al-Najjar, who left Khan Yunis with her daughter. ""We call on the UN to intervene, to stop the war. Enough of fear and terror!""
Gaza civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the displaced endured incessant cold rain and warned of the ""spread of contagious diseases"".The Israeli army said its ""troops continued to kill numerous armed terrorists from close range"" and raided a weapons storage facility in Khan Yunis.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said at least 135 people were killed in Khan Yunis overnight. 
The Hamas government said ""massive tank bombardment"" targeted a refugee camp in the city and its Nasser hospital.
 
- UN court ruling -
 
Issuing a highly anticipated ruling on Friday, the UN's top court said Israel must prevent genocidal acts in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid into the narrow strip of land which has been under relentless bombardment and siege for almost four months.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the case as ""outrageous"" while Gaza's Hamas rulers hailed the ruling, saying it ""contributes to isolating Israel and exposing its crimes in Gaza"".
The decision was based on an urgent application brought by South Africa, long a supporter of the Palestinian cause, but a broader judgement on whether genocide has been committed could take years.
""This is the first time the world has told Israel that it is out of line,"" said Maha Yasin, a 42-year-old displaced Gaza woman.
""What Israel did to us in Gaza for four months has never happened in history."" 
Israel's military campaign began soon after Hamas's October 7 attack that resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.Militants also seized about 250 hostages and Israel says around 132 of them remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead captives.
Israel has vowed to crush Hamas, and Gaza's health ministry says the Israeli military offensive has killed at least 26,257 people, about 70 percent of them women and children.
The army says at least 220 soldiers have been killed since Israel launched its Gaza ground operations.
 
- Patients trapped -
 
With Gaza's humanitarian crisis growing, the UN says most of the estimated 1.7 million Palestinians displaced by the war are crowded into Rafah on the southern border with Egypt.At Khan Yunis's Nasser Hospital, the largest in the besieged city, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said surgical capacity was ""virtually non-existent"".
The charity said the hospital's services had ""collapsed"" and the few staff who remained ""must contend with very low supplies that are insufficient to handle mass casualty events"".
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 350 patients and 5,000 displaced people remained at the hospital as fighting continued nearby.The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Israeli tanks targeted the Al-Amal hospital, another of the city's few remaining medical facilities, and that it was ""under siege with heavy gunfire"".
""There is no longer a healthcare system in Gaza,"" MSF said.
There were 300 to 500 patients trapped at the Nasser hospital with ""war-related injuries such as open wounds, lacerations from explosions, fractures and burns"".
The Israeli military accuses Hamas of operating from tunnels under Gaza hospitals and of using the medical facilities as command centres.
 
- UN sacks staff -
 
Meirav Eilon Shahar, Israel's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, accused the WHO this week of collusion with Hamas by ignoring Israeli evidence of Hamas's ""military use"" of Gaza hospitals.Tedros rejected the accusation, saying it could ""endanger our staff who are risking their lives to serve the vulnerable"".
Relations between Israel and UNRWA soured further after the UN body said tanks had shelled one of its shelters in Khan Yunis on Wednesday, killing 13 people.
UNRWA said on Friday it had sacked several employees accused by Israel of involvement in the October 7 attack. 
The allegations have prompted the United States, Canada, Australia and Italy to suspend funding to the agency.
Israel said it would seek to stop UNRWA from operating in Gaza after the war. Hamas urged the international community to ignore Israel's ""threats"", while the Palestinian Authority said the agency needed ""maximum support"" from donors.CIA chief William Burns is to meet with his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts, as well as Qatar's prime minister, in the coming days in Paris to seek a ceasefire, a security source told AFP.
The UN Security Council will meet to discuss the ICJ's ruling on Wednesday.",Saturday 27 January 2024 - 15:30pm
UN Security Council to vote on Gaza ceasefire with uncertain outcome,"UN - The United States, which has repeatedly blocked calls for a truce in Gaza, will submit a draft resolution to the UN Security Council Friday on the need for ""an immediate ceasefire,"" while Russia pushes for even more explicit demands for peace.
Since the start of the Israeli-Hamas war on October 7, the United States has repeatedly used its UN Security Council veto to block the world body from calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Palestinian territory.
Following their last veto at the end of February, US officials have been negotiating an alternative text focusing on support for diplomatic efforts on the ground for a six-week truce in exchange for the release of hostages.
The latest version, seen by AFP, notes the necessity for ""an immediate and sustained ceasefire to protect civilians on all sides, allow for the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance, and alleviate humanitarian suffering.""
It thereby supports ""diplomatic efforts to secure such a ceasefire in connection with the release of all remaining hostages.""
With the United States under strong international pressure to soften its support for key ally Israel, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the latest resolution sends ""a strong signal.""
The resolution ""does call for an immediate ceasefire tied to the release of hostages, and we hope very much that countries will support that,"" Blinken said in Saudi Arabia. 
However, the text does not explicitly use the word ""call,"" instead simply stating that a ceasefire is imperative, which Russia says is too weak.
""We are not satisfied with anything which doesn't call for an immediate ceasefire,"" Russian Deputy Ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy told reporters Thursday.
Richard Gowan, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, said ""the US is still not demanding a ceasefire without preconditions.""
But ""even this limited shift by the US will worry the Israelis, because (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu wants to keep the UN out of diplomacy over the war altogether.""
According to diplomatic sources, the United States now has enough votes (at least 9 out of 15) for the text to be adopted, but there remains the possibility of a veto by Russia.
US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield has said that she was ""optimistic"" for its adoption.
 
- Condemnation of Hamas - 
 
In addition to the ceasefire, the text also ""rejects any attempt at demographic or territorial change in Gaza"" and also condemns ""all acts of terrorism, including the Hamas-led attacks of October 7"" against Israel.
If adopted, the resolution would mark the first time the Security Council has specifically condemned the Hamas attack, which resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
Israel has relentlessly pounded Gaza, where at least 31,988 people, most of them women and children, have been killed, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory says.
Two humanitarian resolutions that have been adopted by the Council, as well as those in the General Assembly, have not mentioned Hamas, an absence lambasted by Israel.
Several non-permanent Security Council members have circulated their own draft project in recent days which ""demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire for the month of Ramadan"" and the immediate release of all hostages, according to a text seen by AFP.
If the US text is rejected, then this draft ""will come to the table and put to the vote and I hope it will be adopted,"" said France's UN Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere, adding that now was the ""time to save lives.""
However, a vote on that text would have an equally uncertain outcome.
The Council has been largely divided on the Israeli-Palestinian issue for years and has only managed to adopt the two essentially humanitarian resolutions on the topic since October 7.
But even those had little effect: the entry of aid into Gaza remains largely insufficient and famine looms.
Several political resolutions have been rejected by US vetoes on the one hand or Russian and Chinese vetoes on the other -- or by an insufficient number of votes overall.

Scores killed in Gaza strikes as new aid convoy arrives,"GAZA - Scores of Palestinians were killed in central Gaza on Sunday after Israel stepped up its strikes on the war-torn enclave and another convoy of 17 aid trucks arrived as the Hamas-run territory faces ""catastrophic"" shortages. 
With the violence raging unchecked, Iran said the region could spiral ""out of control"" and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stark warning to Lebanon's Hezbollah, saying getting involved would be ""the mistake of its life"".
But Washington also fired a shot across the bows of any actors looking to inflame the conflict, saying it wouldn't hesitate to act in the event of any ""escalation"".
Hamas militants stormed across the border into Israel on October 7, launching a raid that killed at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians who were shot, mutilated or burnt to death on the first day, according to Israeli officials.
They also seized more than 200 hostages in the worst-ever attack in Israel's history.
Israel has hit back with a relentless bombing campaign which has so far killed more than 4,600 Palestinians, mainly civilians, according to Gaza's health ministry, with officials saying the central town of Deir al-Balah had been particularly badly hit overnight.
The ministry said at least 80 people had been killed in the overnight raids on central Gaza which had destroyed more than 30 homes.At the hospital morgue, an AFP journalist saw the bodies of many children on the bloodied floor, where distraught families wept as they identified the victims.
Among them was a man clutching his dead toddler and a young boy who pulled back a blanket over his little sister's body. 
""My cousin was sleeping in his house with his daughter in his arms. He was a man with no record, nothing to do with the resistance,"" said Wael Wafi, gazing at the body of his cousin, his arm still wrapped around his three-year-old daughter Misk.
Also Sunday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said that 29 of its staff had been killed since the start of the war in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, saying half of them were teachers. On Saturday it had given a toll of 17.
The scale of the bombing has left basic systems unable to function, with the UN saying dozens of unidentified bodies had been buried in a mass grave in Gaza City because cold storage had run out.
Meanwhile, an Israeli soldier was killed near the Gaza border by an anti-tank missile fired by militants inside the enclave, the army said.
It said rocket warning sirens had sounded repeatedly in southern and central Israel throughout the day, including in the southern city of Beersheba.
 
- 'Accident' as Israel hits Egypt post -
 Meanwhile, a second convoy of 17 trucks of aid entered Gaza from Egypt on Sunday following an initial delivery of 20 trucks on Saturday after intensive negotiations and US pressure. 
Separately, an AFP journalist saw six trucks leaving Rafah after filling up from dwindling fuel stocks held at the crossing as the enclave faces catastrophic shortages after Israel cut off supplies of food, water, fuel and electricity, although it later resumed water supplies to the south on October 15.
Although Egyptian media said another 40 trucks would enter Gaza on Monday, the UN says the enclave needs 100 trucks per day to meet the needs of Gaza's 2.4 million residents.
And so far, there have been no deliveries of fuel, with UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini warning Sunday that supplies would run out ""in three days"".
""Without fuel, there will be no water, no functioning hospitals and.. aid will not reach many civilians in desperate need,"" he said. With fears growing that the conflict could spread, Israel on Sunday admitted accidentally hitting an Egyptian border post with a tank shell, apologising for the incident which Cairo said had left an unspecified number of border guards with ""minor injuries"". 
The Egyptian army said they had been hit by ""fragments of a shell accidentally fired from an Israeli tank"" and that it was looking into the incident.
 
- Risk of regional escalation -
 
Meanwhile, there were fresh exchanges of fire over Israel's northern border with Lebanon as fears grew that Hezbollah, a close ally of Hamas and Iran, could enter the conflict, prompting Israel's Netanyahu to warn it would be ""the mistake of its life"".
""We will strike it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the significance for it and the state of Lebanon will be devastating,"" he said.
Iran also warned about the conflict spreading on Sunday, with top diplomat Hossein Amir-Abdollahian cautioning that if Washington and Israel did not ""immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza, anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control"".But Washington said it wouldn't hesitate to act in the event of any ""escalation"" in connection with Israel's war with Hamas, just hours after the Pentagon moved to step up military readiness in the region.
""If any group or any country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate situation that we see, our advice is: don't,"" US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said on ABC News.
With tensions rising, Israel has evacuated dozens of northern communities, and nearly 4,000 people have fled villages in south Lebanon for shelter in the southern city of Tyre.
On Sunday, Pope Francis used his weekly Angelus prayer in Rome to plead for an end to the bloodshed. 
""War is always a defeat, it is a destruction of human fraternity. Brothers, stop!"" he said. 
He later held a 20-minute conversation with US President Joe Biden about ""conflict situations in the world and the need to identify paths to peace"", the Vatican said. And thousands rallied in Paris to demand an end to Israel's operation in Gaza in the first pro-Palestinian rally in the French capital that wasn't banned on security grounds.

Israel resumes military operations in Gaza as truce expires,"TEL AVIV - Israel announced a resumption of combat in Gaza on Friday, carrying out a series of airstrikes across the territory, as a truce expired with no agreement to extend it.
""Hamas violated the operational pause, and in addition, fired toward Israeli territory,"" the Israeli military said.
""The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) has resumed combat against the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip.""
It said fighter jets were ""currently striking Hamas terror targets"" in Gaza, and AFP journalists reported airstrikes in the north and south of the territory.
The Hamas-run health ministry said strikes killed three people in southern Gaza's Rafah, where many Palestinians fled after being told by Israel to leave the north of the territory.
A source close to Hamas told AFP that the group's armed wing had received ""the order to resume combat"" and to ""defend the Gaza Strip,"" with heavy fighting reported in parts of Gaza City.
The fighting resumed shortly after Israel's military said it had intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza, the first from the territory since a missile launched minutes into the start of the truce.
Sirens warning of potential missile fire sounded around several communities near Gaza in the hour after the fighting resumed, and Israeli authorities said they were restarting security measures in the area including closing schools.
The renewed conflict dashed hopes for an extension of a seven-day truce during which dozens of hostages were freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and more aid entered the ravaged Gaza Strip.
On Thursday, US top diplomat Antony Blinken, meeting Israeli and Palestinian officials, called for the pause in hostilities to be extended, and warned any resumption of combat must protect Palestinian civilians.
The truce had paused fighting that began on October 7 when Hamas militants broke through Gaza's militarised border into Israel.
The surprise attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants kidnapped about 240, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response and unleashed an air and ground military campaign in Gaza that the Hamas government says has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians.
- 'Coming back' -
 
During the truce brokered by Qatar, 80 Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.More than 20 foreigners, most of them Thais living in Israel, were freed outside the scope of the agreement.
Overnight, six more Israelis, some holding dual nationality, were released, hours after two women were freed.
That brought the total freed Thursday to eight, less than the 10 hostages a day the truce deal required Hamas to release. A source close to the militant group said it was counting two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday as part of the seventh batch.
The release brought relief for Keren Shem, whose daughter Mia was among those freed. The family released footage showing Keren weeping with joy as she was informed by phone of her daughter's imminent freedom.
""Mia is coming back,"" she cried out.
Not long after the hostages arrived in Israel, the country's prison service said another 30 Palestinian prisoners -- 23 minors and seven women -- had been freed. 
- Fears for civilians -
 
After meeting leaders in Israel and the occupied West Bank, Blinken said Washington wants ""to see this process continue to move forward.""
""We want an eighth day and beyond.""
A source close to Hamas said the group backed another extension and mediators were working to prolong the pause, but the negotiations appeared to have failed.But Israel made it clear it viewed the truce as a temporary pause to secure the release of hostages.
""We swore... to eliminate Hamas, and nothing will stop us,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video released by his office, after meeting with Blinken.
His government has come under increasing pressure, however, to account for how it will protect civilians in the territory, which is under blockade, with no way for people to escape.
Blinken warned that any resumed military operation by Israel ""must put in place humanitarian civilian protection plans that minimise further casualties of innocent Palestinians"".
Specifically, Israel must ""clearly and precisely"" designate areas ""in southern and central Gaza, where they can be safe and out of the line of fire"", he said.
International bodies have called for more time to get medical supplies, food and fuel into Gaza, where an estimated 1.7 million people have been forced from their homes.The truce had allowed people to return to the ruins of their homes to pick through the rubble for remaining belongings and provided a sense of safety after weeks of daily bombardment.
""We are afraid that the truce will end, so the problems and the bombings will start again,"" Gaza City resident Mohamad Naasan told AFP on Thursday.
""I hope that the truce resumes... so peace prevails, and we all go back home.""
The violence in Gaza has also raised tensions in the West Bank, where nearly 240 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers since October 7, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry.
- Report: Israel had intelligence on attack -
 
 The New York Times reported overnight that Israeli authorities were aware Hamas was planning a major assault, and had obtained a blueprint for the attack, which the group appears to have largely followed on October 7.
Intelligence and military officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, even after a signals analyst warned the group had carried out a training exercise in line with the plan, according to the report.

Israel battles Hamas as UN calls Gaza 'hell on earth',"GAZA - Israeli forces battled Hamas militants and bombed more targets in the devastated Gaza Strip Tuesday with the UN General Assembly due to vote on a new demand for a ceasefire.
More than two months into the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, the visiting chief of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, likened Gaza to ""hell on earth"".
The Hamas-run health ministry updated its death toll in Gaza to 18,412, mostly women and children.
The militant Islamist group said Israeli forces raided a hospital in Gaza City, the biggest urban centre.
""Israeli occupation forces are storming Kamal Adwan hospital after besieging and bombing it for days,"" health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said, accusing troops of rounding up men in the hospital courtyard, including medical staff.The army did not immediately comment, but Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals, schools, mosques and tunnels beneath them as military bases -- claims it has denied.
The UN humanitarian agency OCHA said earlier that ""the hospital remains surrounded by Israeli troops and tanks, and fighting with armed groups has been reported in its vicinity for three consecutive days"".
It said two mothers were killed in a strike on the maternity ward, and that about 3,000 internally displaced people were trapped in the facility amid reports of ""extreme shortages of water, food and power"".
The war began with Hamas's October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures, and saw around 240 hostages taken back to Gaza.Israel has responded to the unprecedented attack with an offensive aiming to destroy Hamas that has reduced much of Gaza to rubble.
UN agencies and aid groups fear the Palestinian territory will soon be overwhelmed by starvation and disease, and are pleading with Israel to boost efforts to protect civilians.
Air and artillery strikes again rained down on multiple targets in Gaza, a day after Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant reported significant progress in the war, now in its third month.
""Hamas is on the verge of dissolution -- the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is taking over its last strongholds,"" he said.
 
- 'WWII-level devastation' -
 
The war has deepened the suffering in Gaza, whose devastation top European Union diplomat Josep Borrell has compared to that of Germany during World War II.The UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced by the conflict, half of them children.
Israeli air strikes killed at least 24 people in Rafah near the border with Egypt, where tens of thousands are seeking shelter, the Gaza health ministry said.
One strike left a deep crater and gutted surrounding buildings. Teenagers salvaged belongings from the debris with their hands, a young girl retrieving some notebooks.
""There are still people under the rubble,"" said resident Abu Jazar, 23. ""We call on the Arab people and the world to put on pressure to stop the strikes on Gaza.""At Rafah hospital, bereaved father Hani Abu Jamaa cradled the body of his young daughter Sidal, who was killed by shrapnel. 
He said there had been strong explosions overnight and he only found she was dead when he tried to wake her on Tuesday morning.
""Even if I live 100 years, I will never find another like her,"" he said, crying. ""May God have mercy on her, oh Lord.""
 
- 'No water, no power, no bread' -
 
Israel's military said it had struck a rocket launch site in Jabalia near Gaza City that had fired on Sderot in southern Israel, and also found hundreds of shells and rocket-propelled grenade launchers in a Hamas compound.Fighting and heavy bombardment in south Gaza, where Israel previously urged civilians to seek safety, have left people with few places to go.In Gaza City, thousands of Palestinians set up camp at a UN agency headquarters after nearby homes and shops were destroyed by Israeli strikes.
An AFP correspondent said both the Islamic and adjacent Al-Azhar universities had been reduced to rubble, as had the police station.
""There is no water. There is no electricity, no bread, no milk for the children, and no diapers,"" said Rami al-Dahduh, 23, a tailor.
 
- New UN meeting -
 
The UN General Assembly was due to vote later Tuesday on a non-binding resolution demanding ""an immediate humanitarian ceasefire"".
The draft text, seen by AFP, largely reproduces the resolution blocked by the United States, a key ally of Israel, at a UN Security Council vote on Friday.
""We condemn anyone who encourages Israel to continue its killings,"" Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told a cabinet meeting in Ramallah ahead of the vote.
""While claiming to be against the killing of civilians, the United States obstructs the Security Council resolutions to halt the war,"" he said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had received the ""full backing"" of the United States which would block ""international pressure to stop the war"".
He added, however, that ""there is disagreement about 'the day after Hamas' and I hope that we will reach agreement here as well.""Arab countries called the new special session of the General Assembly after more than a dozen Security Council ambassadors visited the Rafah border.
Fears of a wider conflict continue to grow, with Iran-backed groups targeting US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria, and daily exchanges of fire along Israel's border with Lebanon.
France said one of its frigates shot down a drone threatening a Norwegian-flagged tanker hit in an overnight missile attack claimed by Iran-backed Huthi rebels.

Film star Hend Sabri quits as WFP ambassador over Gaza war,"TUNIS - Tunisian film star Hend Sabri has resigned as World Food Programme goodwill ambassador in protest at what she called the use of starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza.
Sabri, a leading figure in Arab cinema, said that she had decided with ""a heavy heart and deep sadness"" to step down after 13 years with the United Nations agency.
In a statement published on social media platform X late Wednesday, the 44-year-old said that she had asked the WFP leadership to push for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the besieged Palestinian territory.
She said that she had hoped the agency ""would use its voice forcefully"" as it had done in previous crises.
""However, hunger and starvation have been used as weapons of war... against more than two million civilians in Gaza,"" Sabri said.
A pause in fighting, due to take effect on Friday, was ""too little too late,"" she added.
Sabri's most recent film, ""Four Daughters,"" was named joint winner of a documentary film prize at this year's Cannes festival.
Directed by Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania, it explores the true story of how a mother comes to terms with the decision by two of her children to flee to Libya and join the Islamic State group.
Following her resignation, the WFP offered its ""heartfelt gratitude"" for Sabri's ""unwavering support and dedication"" as goodwill ambassador.
Israel tightened its siege of Gaza alongside relentless bombardment after Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out the deadliest attack in the country's history on October 7.
Israel says that around 1,200 people were killed in the cross-border raids -- most of them civilians -- and about 240 taken hostage.
The Hamas-run government in Gaza says Israel's operations have killed more than 14,000 people, also mostly non-combatants, and left much of the territory in ruins.
The planned four-day truce will see hostages freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
The pause is also intended to provide aid to Gaza's 2.4 million residents struggling to survive with shortages of food, water and fuel.",Thursday 23 November 2023 - 18:33pm
Israel escalates Gaza strikes after medicine-for-aid deal,"Israel stepped up strikes on the south of war-torn Gaza Wednesday, ahead of the expected delivery of medicines for hostages in exchange for humanitarian aid under a newly brokered deal.
Air strikes and artillery fire targeted Khan Yunis throughout the night, said an AFP correspondent in the southern Gaza Strip's biggest city.
""It was the most difficult and intense night in Khan Yunis since the start of the war,"" said Gaza's Hamas government, whose health ministry reported 81 deaths across the Palestinian territory.
Fighting has ravaged Gaza since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel that resulted in the death of about 1,140 people, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
At least 24,448 Palestinians, about 70 percent of them women, young children and adolescents, have been killed in Israeli bombardments and ground assaults, according to the Gaza health ministry's latest figures.Hamas and other militants seized about 250 hostages during the October 7 attacks, and around 132 remain in Gaza, including at least 27 believed to have been killed.
The fate of those still in captivity has gripped Israeli society, while a broader humanitarian crisis in Gaza marked by the threat of famine and disease has fuelled international calls for a ceasefire.
 
- Medicine for hostages -
 
The agreement announced on Tuesday allowing medicines to reach the hostages and aid to enter the besieged Palestinian territory was brokered by Qatar and France.Under the deal, ""medicine along with other humanitarian aid is to be delivered to civilians in Gaza... in exchange for delivering medication needed for Israeli captives in Gaza,"" Qatar's foreign ministry said.
The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the deal, under which 45 hostages are expected to receive medication.The International Committee of the Red Cross welcomed the deal, saying it was ""a much-needed moment of relief"".
A security source in Egypt said a Qatari plane carrying medicines had arrived on Wednesday at El-Arish near the Rafah border crossing with Gaza.
France said the drugs would be sent to a hospital in Rafah where they would be handed over to the Red Cross and divided into batches before being transferred to the hostages.
Hamas released dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel during a November ceasefire mediated by Qatar, which hosts the group's political office.
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said he was hopeful Qatar-brokered talks could lead to another such deal ""soon"".
 
- 'Why are they doing this?' -
 
At the Abu Yussef Al-Najjar hospital in Rafah, Palestinians stood in front of bodies wrapped in shrouds, mourning the loss of loved ones killed in an overnight Israeli strike.""Why are they doing this? They are destroying us,"" Umm Muhammad Abu Odeh, a woman displaced from the north Gaza town of Beit Hanun, told AFP.
The Israelis ""told us to go south, and we came here... but there is no safe place in Gaza, neither in the north, nor in the south, nor the middle.
""Everything is being struck. Everywhere is dangerous.""
The United Nations says the war has displaced roughly 85 percent of Gaza's 2.4 million people, many of whom have been forced to crowd into shelters and struggle to get food, water, fuel and medical care.
In Tel Aviv, anti-war protesters scuffled with police on Tuesday night, as some held up signs reading ""End the siege"" and ""Stop the genocide"".The Israeli public has kept up intense pressure on Netanyahu's government to secure the return of the hostages, with officials repeatedly insisting military pressure is necessary to bring about any kind of deal.
On Tuesday, an Israeli kibbutz confirmed two hostages whose deaths were announced by Hamas in a video had been killed in Gaza.
 
- West Bank violence -
 
Violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since October 7 to a level not seen since the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, between 2000 and 2005.On Wednesday the Palestinian Red Crescent said an Israeli strike killed four people in the city of Tulkarem, in the north of the Palestinian territory.
The Israeli army said separately it killed a top Palestinian militant in an air strike in the West Bank that averted a ""terrorist attack"" he had been planning.
An AFP correspondent saw a pile of debris and mangled remains of a car that was hit in the strike near the Balata camp in the northern city of Nablus.
Israeli army raids and attacks by settlers have killed around 350 people in the territory, according to an AFP tally based on sources from both sides.
Fears are mounting that the Israel-Hamas conflict will trigger an all-out war across the Middle East, with growing violence involving allies of the Iran-backed Hamas.
The US military said it carried out fresh strikes in Yemen on Tuesday after the country's Iran-backed Huthi rebels claimed another missile attack on a cargo ship in the Red Sea.Also on Tuesday, Israel's army hit Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon, with a security source saying the strikes were ""the most intense"" on a single area since the Hamas-aligned militants first began exchanging cross-border fire with Israel after the start of the war in Gaza.
Meanwhile, Iran -- which backs both the Huthis and Hezbollah -- carried out a missile attack in Iraq's Kurdistan region against what its Revolutionary Guards alleged was an Israeli spy headquarters and a ""gathering of anti-Iranian terrorist groups"".",Wednesday 17 January 2024 - 14:00pm
Hamas outlines Gaza truce proposal as battles rage,"Hamas was reviewing a proposal for a six-week truce in its war with Israel, a source told AFP on Wednesday, as fighting raged in southern Gaza and the UN sought to restore aid funding.
Israeli strikes killed at least 125 people overnight and into the early morning across the Palestinian territory, the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip said, while the military announced it had begun flooding the militants' tunnels.
AFPTV footage showed smoke rising over central Gaza and Khan Yunis, the coastal strip's main southern city that has become the focus of fighting in recent weeks.
As Qatari- and Egyptian-led mediation efforts gathered pace, a Hamas official said the group's leader Ismail Haniyeh ""will be in Cairo today or tomorrow (Wednesday or Thursday)"" to discuss the truce proposal.
A separate Hamas source told AFP the three-stage plan would start with an initial six-week halt to the fighting -- now in its fourth month -- that will see more aid deliveries into the besieged Gaza Strip.Only ""women, children and sick men over 60"" held by Gaza militants will be freed during that stage in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, the source said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.
There would also be ""negotiations around the withdrawal of Israeli forces,"" with possible additional phases involving more hostage-prisoner exchanges, said the source, adding the territory's rebuilding is also among issues addressed by the deal.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out pulling forces from Gaza.
He has also ruled out releasing ""thousands"" of Palestinian prisoners as part of any deal, though his office earlier called the talks ""constructive"".
Ron Dermer, an Israeli minister close to Netanyahu, is expected to meet Wednesday with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Washington, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due for another Mideast trip in the ""coming days"", a US official said.
The United States was among several top donor countries which suspended funding to the UN's aid agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
 
- 'Backbone' -
 
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a UN committee he had ""met with donors to listen to their concerns and to outline the steps we are taking"".
He called UNRWA ""the backbone of all humanitarian response in Gaza"".
UNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai told AFP the agency supports ""an independent investigation"" into the Israeli claims that led to the funding crisis. Israel accused several UNRWA staff members -- out of the agency's 33,000 -- of involvement in the October 7 attack that sparked the war.The UN agency provides Gazans with basic food supplies, medical services and shelters, and ""if we were to unplug these services, then the situation will truly be a free fall,"" she warned.
The war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages. Israel says 132 of them remain in Gaza including at least 29 people believed to have been killed.
Following the deadliest attack in Israel's history, its military launched a withering air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 26,900 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.The Israeli army said Wednesday its troops had killed dozens of militants and captured 10 during a raid on a school where they were allegedly hiding.
Israeli forces also raided what the army described as a weapons and explosives factory in Khan Yunis used by Islamic Jihad, an armed group fighting alongside Hamas.
In Gaza City, in the north, bodies shrouded in white cloth were laid on a hospital floor and carried on donkey carts ahead of burial.
Hamas reported ""dozens of air raids"" overnight on Khan Yunis, where vast areas have been reduced to a muddy wasteland of bombed-out buildings.
Witnesses said artillery shells hit the area of Nasser Hospital, the city's largest, where displaced Palestinians have been sheltering.
 
- 'Constant fear' -
 
The Palestinian Red Crescent said on social media platform X that ""Israeli shelling and gunfire continue"" around another hospital in Khan Yunis.Staff and patients at the Red Crescent's Al-Amal Hospital ""and thousands of displaced people, primarily children and women, live in constant fear and anxiety"", it said.
Israel accuses Hamas of operating from tunnels under hospitals in Gaza and of using medical facilities as command centres, a charge denied by the Islamist group, designated a ""terrorist"" organisation by the European Union and the United States.
Qatar, which helped broker a previous truce and hostage release in November, voiced hope the initial deal now being negotiated might lead to a permanent ceasefire.
Violence involving Iran-backed allies of Hamas across the Middle East has surged during the Israel-Hamas war, also drawing in US forces in the region.Both Washington and Tehran have stressed they do not seek wider war.
The United States and Britain have also launched air strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who have carried out repeated attacks on shipping in the Red Sea in what the rebels describe as an act of solidarity with Palestinians.
As a result, the International Monetary Fund said container shipping through the vital trade route has dropped this year by about one-third.",Wednesday 31 January 2024 - 20:20pm
Spanish aid vessel visible off Gaza coast: AFP journalist,"GAZA CITY - The first aid vessel heading to the besieged Gaza Strip via a new maritime corridor was visible Friday off the coast of the war-ravaged territory, an AFP journalist said.
Images shot by the journalist showed the Open Arms towing a barge which the Spanish charity operating it says is carrying 200 tonnes of food for Gazans threatened with famine after more than five months of war.
Ship-tracking websites showed the Open Arms roughly five kilometres (three miles) off the coast of northern Gaza.
A handful of civilians gathered on the rubble-strewn coast on Friday to watch the vessel, AFP footage showed, though it was unclear when it would actually reach shore.
""I want (the aid) for my children. I want them to live and not die of hunger"", Abu Issa Ibrahim Filfil, a 35-year-old displaced Palestinian man, told AFP.
""All they are eating is wild plants. There is no bread"", he said.
Open Arms is a partner of the United States charity World Central Kitchen, which has a team in Gaza building a jetty onto which the cargo can be unloaded. 
Cyprus, the Mediterranean nation which is the starting point for the maritime corridor, has said a second, bigger vessel is being readied to make the same journey.
However, the sea missions and airdrops are ""no alternative"" to land deliveries, 25 organisations including Amnesty International and Oxfam said in a statement this week.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza has in recent weeks recorded at least 27 deaths from malnutrition and dehydration, most of them children.
The war in Gaza began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
Israel's retaliatory military campaign to eliminate Hamas has killed at least 31,341 people, according to the health ministry.",Friday 15 March 2024 - 12:30pm
Israel must prevent genocidal acts in Gaza: UN court,"The UN top court on Friday said Israel must prevent genocidal acts in Gaza and facilitate ""urgently needed"" humanitarian aid into the besieged territory, handing down rulings in a case that has drawn global attention.
The court urged Israel to refrain from any possible genocidal acts as it presses its military operation in the Gaza Strip, but stopped short of ordering a ceasefire.
Israel must take ""immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians,"" the court said.
At this stage, the ICJ was not considering whether Israel is actually committing genocide in Gaza -- that process will take several years.
But the court warned Israel to ""take all measures in its power to prevent"" acts that could fall under the UN Genocide Convention, set up in 1948 as the world reeled from the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust.
It also said Israel should ""prevent and punish"" any incitement to genocide.
The case was brought by South Africa, which has accused Israel of breaching the UN Genocide Convention.
Over two days of hearings earlier this month in the gilded hall of the Peace Palace, where the ICJ sits, lawyers from both sides battled it over the interpretation of this Convention.
South Africa accused Israel of ""genocidal"" acts that were intended to cause the ""destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group.""
It urged the court to order Israel to ""immediately suspend"" its military operations in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid to reach the civiilians there.
- 'Grossly distorted' -
Israel dismissed the case as a ""grossly distorted story"" and said that if any genocidal acts had been carried out, they had been executed against Israel during the October 7 Hamas attacks.
""What Israel seeks by operating in Gaza is not to destroy a people, but to protect a people, its people, who are under attack on multiple fronts,"" said Tal Becker, Israel's top lawyer.
The question now is whether the court's rulings will be obeyed.
Although its rulings are legally binding, it has no mechanism to enforce them and they are sometimes completely ignored -- it has ordered Russia to stop its invasion of Ukraine for example.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already hinted Israel would not abide by any ruling saying ""no one will stop us"", not even a verdict in The Hague.
But experts believe that aside from the significant symbolic impact of the ruling, there could be tangible consequences on the ground.
""It makes it much harder for other states to continue to support Israel in the face of a neutral third party finding there is a risk of genocide,"" said Juliette McIntyre, international law expert from the University of South Australia.
""States may withdraw military or other support for Israel in order to avoid this,"" she added.
The October 7 Hamas attack resulted in the death of around 1,140 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
At least 26,083 Palestinians, around 70 percent of them women, young children and adolescents, have been killed in the Gaza Strip in Israeli bombardments and ground offensive since then, according to the Hamas government's health ministry.

Israel expands offensive in Gaza,"GAZA CITY - Israel expanded its offensive against Hamas militants in besieged Gaza on Monday, as international concern deepened over the mounting civilian death toll in a war sparked by the October 7 attacks.
The return to open warfare after a truce between Israel and Hamas expired has had ripple effects around a region on the cusp of a wider conflagration.
Since the expiry of the truce on Friday, fighting in Gaza has resumed between Hamas and advancing Israeli troops, as have launches of militant rockets toward Israel and Israeli air strikes on the Palestinian territory.
Over the weekend, Israeli air strikes on northern Gaza threw thick clouds of smoke and dust into the sky.
On Sunday, the Israeli army reported a string of rocket salvos from Gaza into Israel, adding that most had been intercepted.
The Hamas-run government in Gaza and the official Palestinian news agency Wafa said a strike had hit the entrance of the Kamal Adwan hospital in the north of the territory late Sunday.
Several people were killed in the strike, the news agency said, while Hamas accused Israel on Telegram of a ""grave violation"" of humanitarian law.
Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military did not immediately comment on the alleged strike.",Monday 04 December 2023 - 06:58am
Dream of World Cup final is over but Moroccans hail heroes,"DOHA - They may have fallen just short of reaching the World Cup final, but Moroccans on Wednesday hailed their team's historic run as it ended with a 2-0 defeat to reigning champions France.
""They played a great game but luck wasn't on our side,"" said supporter Oussama Abdouh in Casablanca. 
""Still, we stood up to the title-holders, that was great.
""Beyond the World Cup, this team made us dream until the end, and just for that, I raise my hat to them.""
But for Hakim Salama, the 2-0 defeat to France was too much.
""We missed the opportunity of the century,"" he said.
Rain lashed the capital Rabat on Wednesday evening and the atmosphere was far from the exhilaration of the historic victories that brought the Lions of the Atlas to within sight of a World Cup final -- the first Arab or African team to ever get so far.
This time, the car horns and drummers were muted.
""The national team has been performing miracles since the start of the World Cup,"" Rachid Sabbiq, a street trader in the working-class Derb Sultan district of Casablanca, said before the match.
""It doesn't matter whether they win or lose -- they've won the respect and admiration of all Moroccans, and that's priceless,"" he said.
Sabbiq had swapped his usual fare of sweets to sell Moroccan flags.
Despite the loss, ruler King Mohammed VI sent his ""warm congratulations"" to the whole team for having ""honoured the Moroccan people"", according to the country's national news agency MAP. 
The king also conveyed a congratulatory message to French President Emmanuel Macron by telephone post-match, the news agency said. 
 'They make us dream' 
One of the oldest neighbourhoods in Casablanca, Derb Sultan was a bastion of resistance against colonial authorities when the North African kingdom was a French protectorate from 1912 until 1956. 
It also gave rise to one of Morocco's top teams, Raja de Casablanca, and is the birthplace of legendary striker Mohamed Jarir (alias ""Houmane""), who in 1970 became the first Moroccan ever to score in the World Cup.
""In this neighbourhood, we love football, so of course the national team's victories make us dream,"" said teenager Mohamed Nadifi, a teenager whose idol is winger Sofiane Boufal.
All over Morocco, shops have been selling team jerseys and flags.
""Not only have the Lions made us happy but they also allowed us to get business going again"" despite rough economic times for many Moroccans, said trader Khalid Alaoui.
Touria Matrougui braved cold and torrential rain to buy jerseys for her four nephews.
""They held the Moroccan flag high, and for that, we can never thank them enough,"" she said.
 International support 
The team's success has also won it support far across the continent. 
""Morocco has made an entire continent proud,"" said Sidibey Zoumana, from the Ivory Coast, who has lived in the country since 2018.""I've been watching their progress as if it was my own country.""
From Gaza to Senegal, the team's success has transformed the image of Morocco.
""They proved that an African team can go places, and really compete,"" said Said Mouhssine, 48, after the match.
For others, the match had a taste of politics, coming in the middle of a diplomatic spat between Paris and Rabat over the ever-contentious Western Sahara issue.
Some fans were doubly disappointed, as national carrier Royal Air Maroc was forced to cancel extra flights for fans to Qatar just hours after announcing them.
Other supporters who had already reached the Gulf state were unable to get tickets they had been promised.
Some accused staff at the Moroccan Football Federation of handing out the coveted passes to friends and families.",Thursday 15 December 2022 - 06:35am
Israel strikes Gaza's Rafah as truce talks under way,"Israel launched deadly air strikes on Rafah on Thursday, after threatening to send troops in to hunt for Hamas militants in the southern Gaza city where around 1.4 million Palestinians have sought refuge.
Major powers trying to find a way to end the destructive Israel-Hamas war have so far failed, but a US envoy was in Israel Thursday in the latest attempt to secure a truce deal.
International concern has spiralled over Gaza's escalating civilian death toll and the desperate humanitarian crisis sparked by the war that followed Hamas's October 7 attack against Israel.
The war has also triggered mounting violence in the occupied West Bank, where three Palestinian gunmen opened fire on cars in a traffic jam on Thursday, killing one person and wounding eight, including a pregnant woman.The attackers were shot dead at the scene, near a Jewish settlement east of Jerusalem. 
Israeli far-right politicians quickly called for more citizens to carry weapons and for even greater restrictions on Palestinian West Bank residents, while Hamas urged an escalation in attacks.
More than four months of relentless fighting and bombardment have flattened much of Gaza and pushed its population of around 2.4 million to the brink of famine, according to the United Nations. 
Alarm has centred on Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians are living in crowded shelters and makeshift camps where disease threatens.
Israel has warned that, if Hamas does not free the remaining hostages held in Gaza by the start of Ramadan on March 10 or 11, it will keep fighting during the Muslim holy month, including in Rafah.
 
- 'Like an earthquake' -
 
Israel has already been bombing the city, which was again hit overnight and where early Thursday AFP reporters heard multiple air strikes. ""I woke up to the sound of a huge explosion like an earthquake -- fire, smoke, blasts and dust everywhere,"" said Rami al-Shaer, 21, who told AFP he and others pulled wounded family members from the rubble.
Gaza's Civil Defence agency reported ""a number"" of people were killed, while elsewhere in Rafah residents walked amid the rubble of the city's al-Faruq mosque, after strikes. 
""At night, we were surprised by a call asking us to evacuate because the surrounding area was being targeted,"" said Mohamad Abu Khosa, adding that the army had targeted the mosque with two missiles.Another 97 people were killed across the Palestinian territory in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said.
War cabinet member Benny Gantz said Israel's operation in Rafah would begin ""after the evacuation of the population"", although his government has not specified where civilians could go.
Gazans have said nowhere in the territory is safe.
 
- Ceasefire efforts -
 
The war started after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Hamas militants also took about 250 hostages -- 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 30 presumed dead, according to Israel. 
Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 29,410 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest count by Gaza's health ministry. 
Mediators including the United States, Qatar and Egypt, who have tried and so far failed to broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal, made a new push for an agreement.
Brett McGurk, White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, held talks with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, after meeting with other mediators in Cairo who had met Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh earlier this week.Israel's Gantz said there were efforts to ""promote a new plan for the return of the hostages"", adding that ""we are seeing the first signs that indicate the possibility of progress in this direction"".
US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington hopes for an ""agreement that secures a temporary ceasefire where we can get the hostages out and get humanitarian assistance in"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted the army will fight on until it has destroyed Hamas -- but his failure so far to bring home all the captives has led to mounting protests and calls for early elections. 
A poll of hundreds of Israelis, published Wednesday, showed a majority do not think ""absolute victory"" is a likely outcome. 
With Arab support, the United States has called for a pathway to a Palestinian state -- something Israel's parliament has overwhelmingly rejected.
 
- Aid efforts -
 The UN humanitarian agency said aid to Gaza is being gravely hampered by the ""intense hostilities, limitations on the entry and delivery of aid, and growing insecurity"". 
Volunteer Mohammad al-Oukshia at NGO World Central Kitchen in Rafah said the group was trying to provide ""nutritious meals to displaced people"" and was hoping to expand to northern Gaza, where famine fears are most acute.
In the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said an Israeli tank had fired on a house sheltering their employees and families. 
Two relatives of MSF staff were killed and six others wounded, it said, condemning the strike in the ""strongest possible terms"". The military said troops killed more than 15 militants in Khan Yunis, which has seen fierce fighting. 
Elsewhere in the region, the war has led to attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Red Sea shipping lanes vital for global trade.  
The Huthis say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians.

Gaza hospitals in crisis as Israel-Hamas conflict rages on,"Gaza's hospitals were facing ""complete collapse"", Palestinian medics warned Wednesday as the UN said supplies were running critically low and the Hamas-run health ministry reported 700 deaths in Israeli strikes in 24 hours.
Alarm is growing over the spiralling humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, which Israel has been bombing since October 7 when Hamas gunmen poured across its border beginning an attack that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, while also kidnapping more than 220 others, according to Israeli officials.
UN figures show over a third of the narrow Palestinian territory's 35 hospitals have closed due to damage or insufficient fuel, and one doctor said he was forced to perform surgeries without anaesthetic.
""The hospitals are in a state of complete collapse,"" said Mohammed Abu Selmeya, head of Shifa, Gaza's biggest hospital.
He told AFP ""more than 90 percent of medicines"" had run out and ""we urgently need fuel to run the generators and to operate hospital departments and operating theatres.""
His words came as the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA warned it could be forced to halt its operations by nightfall if it didn't receive any deliveries of fuel.
Israel has cut off Gaza's usual water, food and other supplies, and fewer than 70 relief trucks have entered the impoverished territory since the war began. But none have contained fuel, which Israel fears Hamas will use for weapons and explosives.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to ""eliminate Hamas"" and Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says Israeli strikes since October 7 have killed more than 6,500 people, an increase of over 700 since Tuesday.
""They're not waging war on Hamas, they're waging war on children... It's a massacre,"" raged Abu Ali Zaarab, after his family home was bombed in the southern town of Rafah. 
Tempers flared at the United Nations where Guterres decried the ""epic suffering"" in Gaza and the ""collective punishment"" of its 2.4 million people, drawing a furious response from Israel's top diplomat Eli Cohen, who recounted grisly details of how civilians, including children, had been killed in the deadliest single attack in Israel's history.
Violence has also risen sharply in the occupied West Bank, where health officials said more than 100 Palestinians had been killed, mostly in raids by Israeli troops or in clashes with Israeli settlers.
- 'Severe pain but no anaesthetic' -
According to UN figures, 12 of Gaza's 35 hospitals and nearly two-thirds of its 72 primary healthcare clinics have shut down after being damaged by Israeli air strikes or due to fuel shortages. Fuel is used to power vital services such as hospitals in Gaza which rely on generators, and aid agencies have warned that more people will die if medical equipment, water desalination plants and ambulances stop running. 
Once the generators stop running, hospitals will ""turn into morgues"", the Red Cross has warned.
Hospitals are also struggling with a dramatic shortage of medicines and equipment.
""There's not enough anaesthetic,"" said Ahmad Abdul Hadi, an orthopaedic surgeon working at Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis.
""The wounded are in severe pain but we can't wait for the procedure so we're forced to do the operation. We performed a number of surgeries without anaesthetic. It's tough and painful, but with the lack of resources, what can we do?""
UNRWA has also said its operations were at breaking point from the shortage of fuel. 
""If we do not get fuel urgently, we will be forced to halt our operations in the Gaza Strip as of (Wednesday) night,"" it said on Tuesday. Petrol stations in the southern town of Rafah had also run dry.
""We ask God for the fuel to arrive so cars, tractors, ambulances and UNRWA operations can function to help the people,"" taxi driver Ibrahim Namla told AFP.
""If fuel doesn't enter Gaza today or tomorrow, it will be a disaster.""
And there has been no let-up in the strikes, with one hitting a building in Rafah where many children were inside, residents said.
""We saw the children being bombarded while their mother was hugging them,"" said Umm Omar al-Khaldi, whose neighbours were killed. ""Where are the Arabs? Where is the humanity? Have mercy on us!""
- 'Double standard' -
The Gaza war has sparked fears of a regional conflagration if it draws in more of Israel's enemies -- especially Lebanon's Hezbollah, a close ally of both Iran and Hamas, which has already traded deadly cross-border with Israeli forces along the border.
As the fighting raged on, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah held talks with senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad representatives in Beirut about how to achieve ""real victory... in Gaza and Palestine"" and stop Israel's ""brutal aggression"", the Lebanese movement said.
Jordan's King Abdullah became the latest regional leader to warn that ongoing violence could ""lead to an explosion"" in the wider Middle East after talks with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.
And his wife Queen Rania accused Western leaders of a ""glaring double standard"" for not condemning Israel's killing of Palestinian civilians in its bombardment of Gaza.Earlier on Wednesday, Israeli strikes killed eight soldiers in southern Syria with its airforce later hitting Aleppo airport for the fourth time in a fortnight, the defence ministry in Damascus said.

Gaza fighting rages as UN chief decries 'horror and starvation',"GAZA CITY - Heavy fighting raged Sunday in the Israel-Hamas war as UN chief Antonio Guterres called for a surge of aid into the besieged territory he said was stalked by ""horror and starvation"".
Talks have been held in Qatar towards a truce and hostage release deal but the heads of the CIA and Mossad have left Doha for consultations with their governments, an informed source told AFP.
Air and artillery strikes again rained down on Gaza where Israel has vowed to launch its planned ground offensive against Hamas militants in the crowded far southern city of Rafah, despite rising global concern and objections from the United States.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip said Sunday that another 84 people had been killed over the previous 24 hours, raising the total death toll in the territory during nearly six months of war to 32,226.
Palestinian children badly wounded in the latest bombardment were rescued from the rubble of collapsed buildings and rushed for urgent medical care to Al-Najjar hospital in Rafah.Guterres, on a visit to Egypt, urged an end to the ""non-stop nightmare"" endured by Gaza's 2.4 million people since Hamas sparked the territory's worst ever war with its October 7 attack on Israel.
""Looking at Gaza, it almost appears that the four horsemen of war, famine, conquest and death are galloping across it,"" the United Nations secretary-general said.
""The whole world recognises that it's past time to silence the guns and ensure an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.""
As UN and other aid agencies have warned of the threat of famine in Gaza, Guterres urged Israel to allow in more humanitarian aid via the Rafah border crossing where trucks were queued up.
Israel's military blasted back on social media, saying the UN should scale up its logistics and ""stop blaming Israel for its own failures.""
 
- Hospital battles -
 
Combat has flared for almost a week in and around Gaza's biggest hospital complex, Gaza City's Al-Shifa, which has been a refuge for displaced people and where Israel says Palestinian militants have been hiding out.The Hamas government media office said 190 people had been killed in the Al-Shifa operation, and 30 nearby buildings destroyed.
The army said its forces have killed more than 170 militants and detained about 480 militants ""affiliated with the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist organisations"".
The Palestinian Red Crescent said Sunday that Israeli forces were also besieging two other medical centres, the Nasser and Al-Amal hospitals in southern Gaza's Khan Yunis.
The Red Crescent said messages broadcast from drones demanded that everyone in Al-Amal leave naked, while forces blocked the gates of the hospital with dirt barriers.
""All of our crews are currently under extreme danger and cannot move at all,"" the Red Crescent added.
Israel's military said it began an operation in the Al-Amal neighbourhood ""in order to continue dismantling terrorist infrastructure and eliminating terrorist operatives"".The military said the operation began with air force strikes on about 40 targets, including military compounds and tunnels.
In Rafah city, local resident Hassan Zanoun looked sadly at the remains of his building, reduced to a jumble of broken concrete and rubble.
""My children and I were sleeping here,"" he told AFP. ""Suddenly everything was unleashed over our heads... strikes, screams.
He said he and his daughters ""got out from under the rubble"" but were injured, along with their neighbours.
 
- 'Protecting civilians' -
 
Israel has faced ever greater global opposition to its military campaign as Palestinian civilian deaths have soared and its siege has brought widespread malnutrition and hunger.Jordan's King Abdullah II stressed in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron the need for ""an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and protecting innocent civilians"", the palace said.
He also called for more aid to reach Gaza as his country's planes again airdropped relief supplies there with aircraft from the United States, Egypt, Germany and Singapore.
The Gaza war was sparked by the unprecedented Hamas attack on October 7 that resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Israel has vowed to destroy the militants, who also seized about 250 hostages, of whom Israel believes around 130 remain in Gaza, including 33 presumed dead.
Relatives and supporters of the hostages, demanding greater efforts to bring them home, rallied Saturday outside the defence ministry in Tel Aviv, where some scuffled with police.
 
- US-Israel tensions -
 
Tensions have grown between Israel and its top ally the United States, which provides billions of dollars in military aid to Israel but has called for greater efforts to alleviate Gaza's humanitarian crisis.Washington has made clear it would not support an Israeli attack on Rafah without a plan to protect civilians there.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argued that ""we have no way to defeat Hamas without getting into Rafah and eliminating the battalions that are left there"".
Netanyahu said he had told Secretary of State Antony Blinken that ""I hope to do that with the support of the United States, but if we need to, we will do it alone"".Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was to head to Washington Sunday to discuss the war with Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin and other senior US defence officials.
At the truce talks in Doha, a major sticking point has been Hamas's position that a temporary truce must lead to a permanent Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a demand Israel has rejected.
CIA chief Bill Burns and his Israeli counterpart David Barnea departed Doha late Saturday, a source briefed on the talks told AFP.
The latest negotiations had ""focused on details and a ratio for the exchange of hostages and prisoners"", the source said, adding that technical teams remained in Qatar.

Israel says troops encircle Gaza City as Blinken visits,"Israeli ground troops fighting a war to destroy Hamas had surrounded Gaza City on Friday as top US diplomat Antony Blinken arrived in Israel and declared that the country has right and a duty to defend itself.
Israel, meanwhile, began expelling thousands of Palestinian workers back to Gaza, despite ongoing fighting and air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians in the territory.
In Geneva, the United Nations launched an emergency aid appeal seeking $1.2 billion to help some 2.7 million people facing a humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the West Bank.
The leader of Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, was to make a speech later in the day, breaking with weeks of silence, amid concerns of a broader regional conflagration.
Ahead of Blinken's arrival, Israel's military said it had ""completed the encirclement"" of Gaza's largest city -- signalling a new phase in the nearly month-long conflict.Fighting was triggered by Hamas' bloody raids on October 7, which Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says more than 9,227 people have died in Israeli bombardments, mostly women and children.
After the Hamas assault, Israeli forces moved to re-establish security on the border, trapping thousands of Palestinian workers inside Israel.
On Friday, officials began to force them back into Gaza, AFP journalists at the Karem Abu Salem crossing saw.
""Thousands of workers who were blocked in Israel since October 7 have been brought back,"" Hisham Adwan, head of Gaza's crossings authority, told AFP.
 
- Workers expelled -
 
Israel had said it would start sending the workers back to Gaza.""Israel is severing all contact with Gaza. There will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza,"" the Israeli security cabinet said on Thursday.
The United Nations Human Rights Office said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the expulsions.
""They are being sent back, we don't know exactly to where,"" and whether they ""even have a home to go to"", spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told a news conference in Geneva.
Before the war started, some 18,500 Gazans were holding Israeli work permits, according to Israeli defence officials, but it was not clear how many were in the country on October 7. 
New Israeli strikes rocked the Gaza Strip on Friday morning, an AFP correspondent said, and the Gaza health ministry reported at least 15 deaths in Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood and seven in Jabalia refugee camp.
The Hamas-controlled health ministry said later 14 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike as they fled from north to south Gaza. Witnesses said the strike hit Gaza's coastal road, which the army has previously told civilians to use to travel south.
The Hamas government has said 195 people were killed in Israeli bombardments on Jabalia earlier this week, with hundreds more missing and wounded, figures AFP could not independently verify.
Before his departure, Blinken said he would seek to ensure that harm to Palestinian civilians is reduced, in a visible shift of tone for the United States, which has promised full support and ramped-up military aid to Israel.
But, beginning his visit with talks with President Isaac Herzog, Blinken reiterated the basis of its support, telling reporters: ""Israel has not only the right but the obligation to defend itself ... to make sure that this October 7 never happens again,""  Israel's military describes Gaza City as ""the centre of the Hamas terror organisation"".
Although many of the city's half-a-million residents fled south following Israel's warning to leave ahead of a ground operation, those who stayed behind have endured weeks of aerial bombardment, dwindling supplies and daily carnage.
 
- 'Curse of history' -
 
But yet more mayhem seems to lie ahead, as the conflict turns to urban and underground warfare -- with Hamas fighting from a tunnel complex believed to span hundreds of kilometres (miles).The Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, insisted Israeli soldiers would go home ""in black bags"".
""Gaza will be the curse of history for Israel,"" spokesman Abu Obeida said.
Israel's allies have backed its right to self-defence, but there is growing global concern and anger at how Israel has chosen to prosecute the war.
Addressing a summit of Turkic states in the Kazakh capital Astana, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, saying ""crimes against humanity"" were being committed in Gaza.
And Irish premier Leo Varadkar expressed concern that Israel's response had gone beyond tackling Hamas in self-defence and now ""resembles something more approaching revenge"".The UN  Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said to meet the needs of the 2,7 million people living in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank would cost $1.2 billion, and launched an appeal for donors.
Both Israel and the United States have ruled out a blanket ceasefire, which they say would allow Hamas to regroup and resupply.
US President Joe Biden has backed ""temporary, localised"" pauses in fighting to allow humanitarian work to be done.
 
- Escape to safety -
 
Countries around the world recalled their ambassadors from Israel in protest at the strikes. Bolivia severed diplomatic ties.
Israel has sought to show Jabalia was a legitimate target, saying it killed a senior Hamas commander in a tunnel complex below the camp.Egypt has said it would help evacuate 7,000 foreigners through Rafah, which was to open again on Friday, a source at the crossing told AFP.
The UN said more than 100 trucks with aid crossed into Gaza on Thursday, a significant increase from previous days.
A total of 374 trucks have entered since a US-brokered deal was enacted on October 21, far short of what aid agencies say is needed.

"Israel and Hamas working toward new truce, hostage deal","GAZA - Hopes rose Wednesday that Israel and Hamas may be inching toward another truce and hostage release deal in the Gaza war, following secret talks and as the head of the Palestinian militant group visited Egypt.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late Tuesday told relatives of some of the remaining 129 captives held in Gaza since the October 7 attacks that his spy chief was working on efforts to ""free our hostages"".
""I have just sent the head of Mossad to Europe twice to promote a process to free our hostages,"" the premier told them. ""I will spare no effort on the subject, and our duty is to bring them all back.""Mossad director David Barnea held a ""positive meeting"" in Warsaw this week with CIA chief Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, a source familiar with the talks told AFP, asking not to be named.
Talks were ongoing ""with the aim of reaching an agreement around the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza in exchange for a truce and the potential release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons,"" said the source.
The Qatar-based chief of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, on Wednesday travelled to Egypt, traditionally a key mediator between Israel and the Palestinians, for talks with intelligence chief Abbas Kamel.A source close to Hamas, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the talks would focus on stopping the war and ""to prepare an agreement for the release of prisoners (and) the end of the siege imposed on the Gaza Strip"".
President Isaac Herzog also said Israel was ""ready for another humanitarian pause and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages"".
Another Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad, meanwhile, released video footage it claimed showed two hostages, ramping up pressure on Israel.
The bloodiest ever Gaza war began when Hamas attacked on October 7, killing around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Israel launched a military campaign that Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says has killed 19,667 people, mostly women and children, while also cutting off most water, food and power supplies.The source close to Hamas said the Egypt talks would focus on proposals including a week-long truce that would see the release of 40 Israeli hostages, including women, children and male non-combatants.
Haniyeh, before leaving Qatar, met Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, but no details of their meeting were released.
 
- UN vote expected -
 Fighting raged unabated Wednesday in Gaza, where the Israeli army reported close quarter combat and more than 300 strikes over the past day, while the death toll among its own forces rose to 134 inside Gaza.
It said ""ground, aerial and naval operations were carried out on dozens of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure"" including rocket launch sites and military command and control centres in Khan Yunis.
Hamas sources said at least 11 people were killed overnight in Israeli strikes.
In Khan Yunis, residents searched by hand through the rubble of a building completely flattened by bombardment.The house was ""full of people, why did they bomb it? What's the reason?"" said one distraught young resident, Amr Sheikh-Deeb. 
""We managed to remove some bodies, but where are the rest of them? What did these people do?""
Three corpses lay on the floor of the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, where wounded people were treated, including children.
One man, Abed Abu Aisha, came in carrying his crying child, both covered in blood and dust. ""A missile hit our house, without any prior notice,"" he said. 
""We pulled out some from under the rubble, but more people are still buried. I don't know the exact number of casualties, but a whole family was wounded.""
The UN Security Council was set to vote later Wednesday on a resolution calling for a pause in the conflict,  diplomatic sources told AFP, after two previous votes were delayed as members wrangled over wording.
The latest version of the text calls for the ""suspension"" of hostilities, the sources said. 
The US vetoed a previous ceasefire resolution, sparking condemnation by aid groups which urged more action to help civilians caught in the conflict.
 
- 'On the brink' -
 
The UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million residents have been forced to flee their homes, many sheltering in tents amid dire shortages and the biting winter cold.""Amid displacement at an unimaginable scale and active hostilities, the humanitarian response system is on the brink,"" said Tor Wennesland, the UN's special coordinator for the Middle East peace process.
Israel, which declared a total siege on Gaza at the start of the war, has since allowed in aid trucks through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and, as of this week, its own Kerem Shalom crossing.
The UN's World Food Progamme said Wednesday it had delivered food through the crossing in a first direct aid convoy from Jordan.
An Israeli military agency, COGAT, said it had also started laying a pipeline from Egypt to deliver drinking water from a mobile desalination plant in a project led by the United Arab Emirates. 
But aid groups have warned  the humanitarian goods fall far short of the dire need, and the UN children's agency said that ""child deaths due to disease could surpass those killed in bombardments"".The Gaza war has sparked fears of regional escalation and seen Israel trade deadly cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, where Israel said its aircraft hit more targets Wednesday.
Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels, meanwhile, have repeatedly fired missiles and drones at vessels passing through the Red Sea that they say are linked to Israel, in a show of support for Palestinians.
The United States this week started to build a multinational naval task force to protect the waterway leading to the Suez Canal, through which more than 10 percent of global trade transits.

"26 dead as Israel, Gaza militants trade fire for third day","Israel and Gaza militants traded more heavy fire Thursday, the third day of the worst escalation of violence in months that has killed 26 people in the blockaded Palestinian enclave. 
Air strikes by the Israeli army since Tuesday have killed fighters as well as civilians, including several children, said officials in the crowded coastal territory.Cairo mediated in efforts toward a truce between Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group, while France, Germany, Jordan and Egypt called for an end to the violence. 
""The bloodletting must end now,"" said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock after hosting her three counterparts for talks in Berlin. 
Militants in the Gaza Strip have fired more than 550 rockets at Israel, causing no casualties so far, the Israeli military said.Of these, over 440 rockets made it over the border and at least 154 were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defence system, while one in five fell inside Gaza, it said.
Shops in Gaza were shuttered and the streets largely abandoned as Israeli military aircraft circled over the territory where several buildings lay in ruins.
Islamic Jihad confirmed it has lost five military leaders in strikes in recent days, including Ahmed Abu-Deka.
Abu Deka was the deputy of Ali Ghali, the commander of a rocket launch unit killed by Israel earlier on Thursday.
The Gaza health ministry said a man had been killed in southern Gaza, with the Islamic Jihad confirming it was Abu Deka.
Fresh rockets at southern Israel followed the Israeli strike, AFP correspondents said.
Another militant group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said four of its fighters had been killed.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said he had instructed the security establishment ""to take all the measures necessary, to prepare additional actions and maintain readiness for the possibility of increased fire"".
- 'Wave of escalation' -In Gaza City's Al-Rimal district, Mamoun Radi, 48, said: ""We hope that the wave of escalation will end, but we support revenge for the martyrs.
""Israel assassinated a leader of (Islamic) Jihad at dawn today because it does not want calm.""
Across southern Israel, sirens wailed intermittently through the night and Thursday morning.
Miriam Keren, 78, an Ashkelon resident, said a Gaza rocket had destroyed a workshop and damaged her house.""All the shrapnel is in the room; the house was shaken very powerfully, the glasses fell, the walls were damaged,"" she told AFP.
""Luckily I have a safe room and I entered it immediately and closed the door.
""This isn't the first time the house was hit but I'm not afraid, neither was I yesterday. You're shocked for a moment but it's not about fear. It's more unpleasant, very unpleasant.""
- Ceasefire efforts -
An Islamic Jihad source told AFP that senior member Mohammad al-Hindi, head of the group's political department, would arrive in Cairo on Thursday for talks with Egyptian intelligence officials.An Egyptian source meanwhile told AFP that a security delegation from Cairo would be in Tel Aviv later Thursday for talks with Israeli officials on a ceasefire. 
Israeli officials confirmed Egypt's involvement in attempts to facilitate understandings between the sides toward halting the hostilities.
On Thursday, US Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides said ""we stand by Israel's right to defend itself"", and that Washington was engaged in efforts ""towards a quick deescalation"".
Both Hamas, which rules Gaza, and Islamic Jihad are considered terrorist groups by Israel and the United States.This week's Gaza clashes are the worst since a three-day escalation in August killed 49 Palestinians, with no Israeli fatalities.
Violence has also flared in the occupied West Bank, where the Israeli army has staged repeated raids against militants which have often flared into street clashes or gun battles.
On Thursday, a Palestinian died from his wounds after being shot by the Israeli army in a raid the day before in the West Bank city of Qabatiya, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The conflict has escalated since veteran leader Benjamin Netanyahu returned to power late last year heading a coalition with extreme right and ultra-Orthodox parties.By Adel Zaanoun",Thursday 11 May 2023 - 16:24pm
Islamic State under pressure after Hamas attack on Israel,"The deadly Hamas attack on Israel may have taken the limelight from the Islamic State group, but the jihadists are seeking to capitalise on anger over the bombardment of Gaza to rally followers, analysts say.
Israel has vowed to defeat Hamas after an attack on its soil by the Palestinian militant group on October 7 that killed around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also took around 250 hostages, 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.
The war has put the spotlight on Hamas. 
""Without the Gaza war, IS would get the headlines,"" said Hans-Jakob Schindler, director of the Counter Extremism Project think tank.
""It puts considerable pressure on IS to remain relevant.""
Both groups are described as ""terrorist"" by Israel and the West, but they have very different agendas. 
Hamas, which is backed by the Shiite Islamic republic of Iran, presents itself as defending the Palestinian people against the Israeli occupation since 1948.
Staunchly Sunni, IS is against Iran and focused on trying to revive its project of a global Islamic caliphate, after losing the territory it held in Syria and Iraq between 2014 and 2019.
 
- 'Several fronts' -
 
But its supporters are also against Israel and any ""global Jewish project"", said Laurence Bindner, co-founder of the JOS Project, which analyses extremist propaganda.
""In the Middle East, the enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend,"" she told AFP.
IS ""has positioned itself simultaneously on several fronts: one against Jews and those who support Israel and another against Iran and their allies"".   
Earlier this month, IS claimed an attack in Iran that killed 89 people gathered to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the killing of storied Revolutionary Guards general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike.
Since the start of the war in Gaza, IS has sought to tap into sympathy for Palestinians.
Israel has responded to the October 7 attacks with a relentless military campaign in Gaza, killing more than 23,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled besieged territory.
Late October, IS in its Al-Naba propaganda magazine published a text on ""Practical Ways to Support Muslims in Palestine"", urging followers to attack Israel, its Western backers and all Jews worldwide.
Earlier this month, the jihadist group's spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfah Al-Ansari, posted a recording titled ""And kill them wherever you find them"".
 
- 'Opportunity' -
 
IS has ""identified an opportunity to leverage the hostile anti-Israel sentiments throughout the Muslim world over the aerial bombardment and military invasion of Gaza,"" said Lucas Webber, co-founder of the Militant Wire website.
""It's an opening for increased relevance and success,"" he told AFP.
""Even as IS continues to have a particular disdain for Hamas, it does not mean that the jihadists will forgo taking advantage of the fighting for their own purpose -- pushing supporters to strike in the West, nudging fence-sitters toward action, and aiming to radicalize a growing pool of angry individuals.""
There has been some IS-related activity in Europe in recent months, although only at a low level. 
In France, a French national born to Iranian parents who had sworn allegiance to IS stabbed a German-Filipino tourist to death in Paris in early December.
Italian police said in November they had arrested an Algerian man in the Milan subway, later discovering he was wanted by Algeria since 2015 for alleged ties to IS.
A bigger operation ""would be necessary"" for the jihadist group in Europe for more people to talk about them, Schindler told AFP.
""They have put networks in place for a long time already. Now they really need to do something so they can put themselves back on the agenda"".
Eva Koulouriotis, an independent Middle East expert, said IS was currently focused on building support in the Middle East and Central Africa.
They want to ""achieve greater popularity within Islamic societies and, consequently, attract more members,"" she said.",Friday 12 January 2024 - 17:30pm
Gaza war rages on Christmas Eve as Biden urges caution,"Israel pushed on Sunday with its military campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attacks, as the focus of the deadly combat shifted to southern Gaza where most displaced Palestinians are trapped.
US President Joe Biden stressed the ""critical need"" to protect civilians, in a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed Israel would ""continue the war until all of its goals have been achieved"", officials said.
As heavy fighting raged on, the Israeli army said it had struck another 200 targets in the past 24 hours in the besieged Palestinian territory where it is seeking to defeat Hamas and free remaining hostages.The army said 153 troops had died in Gaza since it launched its ground invasion on October 27. Ten soldiers were lost in battles on Saturday, one of the deadliest days for the Israeli side.
""This is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza,"" said Netanyahu. ""The war is exacting a very heavy price... but we have no choice but to keep fighting.""
The army said soldiers had raided a northern Gaza compound near schools, a mosque and a clinic and found ""explosive belts adapted for children, dozens of mortar shells, hundreds of grenades and intelligence documents"".
Hamas rejected those claims as lies meant ""to justify their massacring of innocent civilians and their destructive aggression that has affected the entire infrastructure... in the already blockaded Gaza Strip"".
The bloodiest ever Gaza war broke out when Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7 and its Islamist militants killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.Israel's withering military campaign, including massive aerial bombardment, has killed 20,424 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
Vast areas of Gaza lie in ruins and its 2.4 million people have endured dire shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine due to an Israeli siege, alleviated only by the limited arrival of aid trucks.Eighty percent of Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN, many now shielding against the winter cold in makeshift tents and forced into the south of Gaza even as ground fighting comes closer.
Near the far southern Gaza city of Rafah, Umm Amir Abu al-Awf, 27, suffered wounds to her hand and legs in a strike on her house early Sunday.
""Who won?"" she said. ""Nothing has been achieved except killing civilians... They keep saying Rafah is safe. It is not safe. Nowhere is safe. Every house has a martyr and injured.""
 
- 'More hatred, less peace' -
 
Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus indicated that forces were close to gaining operational control in northern Gaza and that now ""we focus our efforts against Hamas in southern Gaza"".Fighting has raged in the main southern city of Khan Yunis, the birthplace of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza and the man Israel holds most responsible for the October 7 attack.
Elsewhere, Palestinian rescuers scrambled again to pull survivors and bodies from the rubble of a destroyed residential building, after a strike hit in the central city of Deir al-Balah.""I was praying when a huge explosion occurred,"" said Yazan Moqbel, a wounded man whose sister was still under the broken concrete. ""Rubble fell on us. I didn't know what happened.""
The head of the UN refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, urged an end to the suffering in the third month of the war.
""For aid to reach people in need, hostages to be released, more displacement to be avoided and above all stop the appalling loss of lives, a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is the only way forward,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.""War defies logic and humanity, and prepares a future of more hatred and less peace.""
On Friday, the United States allowed the passage of a UN Security Council resolution that effectively called on Israel to allow ""immediate, safe and unhindered"" deliveries of life-saving aid to Gaza ""at scale"".
World powers had wrangled for days over the wording and, at Washington's insistence, toned down some provisions -- including removing a call for a ceasefire.
One displaced Gazan, Ahmad al-Burawi, now living in Rafah in southern Gaza, said: ""We just want to return to our lands, that's all. We want a solution... People are dying.""
 
- Silent Christmas -
 
As the war rages on, Christians around the world celebrate Christmas Eve, and festivities are usually held in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem where they believe Jesus was born.But this year the city is almost deserted, with few worshippers around and no Christmas tree erected, after church leaders decided to forego ""any unnecessarily festive"" celebrations, in solidarity with Gazans.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas voiced hope Christmas would mark ""a cessation of the Israeli war against the Palestinian people in Gaza, as well as across the occupied Palestinian territories"".
The Gaza war has heightened tensions across the Middle East, where Israel faces a range of enemies -- Iran-backed armed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that have voiced strong support for Hamas.
Cross-border fire has erupted almost daily between Israel and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement.
And Yemen's Huthi rebels have fired at cargo vessels in the Red Sea, leading the United States to build a naval taskforce to deter the missile and drone strikes.The US military said four drones had targeted the USS Laboon, but had been shot down, and that an Indian-flagged tanker was hit and sent out a distress call.
Iran's deputy foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, denied the Islamic republic was orchestrating the campaign, saying the Huthis act on their ""own decisions and capabilities"".
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, in an interview published Sunday, branded Iran ""a thoroughly malign influence in the region and in the world"".",Sunday 24 December 2023 - 13:16pm
Pressure mounts on Israel for Gaza ceasefire,"TEL AVIV - Israel faced growing international pressure on Tuesday to agree to a ceasefire with Hamas, as it planned an incursion into the southern Gaza city Rafah where more than a million Palestinians are trapped. 
CIA Director William Burns was due in Cairo on Tuesday for a new round of talks on a Qatari-mediated ceasefire that would temporarily halt fighting in exchange for Hamas freeing hostages. 
His planned visit comes after Washington and the United Nations warned Israel against carrying out a ground offensive into Rafah without a plan to protect civilians, who say they have nowhere left to go. 
""Wherever we go there's bombing, martyrs and wounded,"" said Iman Dergham, a displaced Palestinian woman. 
On a visit to the White House Monday, Jordan's King Abdullah II pushed for a full ceasefire to end the four-month-old war. 
""We cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafah. It is certain to produce another humanitarian catastrophe,"" said the monarch whose country hosts a large number of Palestinian refugees. 
""We cannot stand by and let this continue. We need a lasting ceasefire now. This war must end.""",Tuesday 13 February 2024 - 08:30am
Hamas chief due in Egypt for Gaza ceasefire talks,"The head of Hamas was due in Egypt on Wednesday for talks on a fresh ceasefire in Gaza, after Israel said it was willing to agree to another pause in exchange for more hostages.
International pressure is mounting for a new truce that could ramp up aid to the besieged Palestinian territory, with the United Nations due to vote Wednesday on calling for a ceasefire.
Qatar-based Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was expected to lead a ""high-level"" delegation to Egypt for talks with the country's spy chief and others on ""stopping the aggression and the war to prepare an agreement for the release of prisoners"", a source close to the group told AFP.
Israel's leaders are facing growing calls to secure the release of 129 hostages they say are being held in Gaza and, on Tuesday, signalled a willingness to return to the negotiating table with Hamas.Israeli President Issac Herzog said his country was ""ready for another humanitarian pause and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had recently sent his spy chief on two trips to Europe in an effort to ""free our hostages"".
US news site Axios reported Monday that David Barnea, head of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, met with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and CIA director Bill Burns in Europe to discuss a potential new deal to free hostages.
Axios also reported Tuesday that Israel had offered to pause the fighting in Gaza for at least one week in exchange for more than three dozen hostages held by Hamas.The war began when Hamas militants burst out of Gaza on October 7, killing around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250, according to the latest Israeli figures.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel began a campaign of bombardment, alongside a ground invasion, that Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry says has killed 19,667 people, mostly women and children.
Qatar, backed by Egypt and the United States, helped broker a week-long truce and hostage-prisoner swap in November in which 80 Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
 
- 'On the brink' -
 
The UN Security Council was set to vote Wednesday on a resolution calling for a pause in the conflict, three diplomatic sources told AFP, after two previous votes were delayed as members wrangled over wording.The latest version of the text calls for the ""suspension"" of hostilities, the sources said.
The US vetoed a previous ceasefire resolution in the council, sparking condemnation by Palestinian and humanitarian groups, which urged more action to help civilians caught in the conflict.
The UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million residents are displaced and concerns are growing about the limited ability of aid groups to help.
""Amid displacement at an unimaginable scale and active hostilities, the humanitarian response system is on the brink,"" said Tor Wennesland, the UN's special coordinator for the Middle East peace process.
UN children's agency spokesman James Elder said he was ""furious that those with power shrug at the humanitarian nightmares unleashed on a million children"".One of the last remaining hospitals in northern Gaza, Al-Ahli, stopped operating after it was stormed and ""put out of action"" by Israeli forces, its director Fadel Naim told AFP.
Homes have been destroyed, forcing many into overcrowded shelters as they struggle to find cooking fuel, food, water and medical care.
With power and communication often cut, Gazans are returning to time-worn traditions including battery-powered radio sets to get news of the war.
""Here in Gaza, we're moving backwards,"" said Salah Zorob, 37, outside his tent. ""They're going to take us back to the Stone Age.""
 
- 'Dismantle Hamas' -
 
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said Tuesday that troops were expanding operations in southern Gaza's Khan Yunis area.""We must dismantle Hamas, and it will take as long as needed,"" he said.
The army says 132 troops have been killed in Gaza since its ground invasion began in late October.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been detained in military operations across the territory, and on Tuesday, the army said it was investigating ""the deaths of terrorists in military detention centres"" without giving details.
The US has urged Israel to protect civilians in Gaza, a call echoed Tuesday by British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who urged Israel to take a ""much more surgical, clinical and targeted approach"" in dealing with Hamas.
After talks with his Italian counterpart in Rome, Cameron said Britain was asking Israel to ""recognise that they have to minimise civilian casualties, they have to obey international humanitarian law at all times"".
 
- Red Sea task force -
 
The Gaza war has sparked fears of regional escalation and seen Israel trade deadly cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon.The Israeli army said it had targeted Hezbollah positions on Tuesday after intercepting fire near the border that wounded two reservists.
Yemen's Huthi rebels, meanwhile, have repeatedly fired missiles and drones towards cargo ships in the Red Sea in what they say is a show of support for Palestinians.
Major shipping firms have diverted their vessels as a result, and the US announced on Monday a new multinational naval task force to protect the waterways, through which 12 percent of global trade transits.
In its current form, the task force includes warships from the United States as well as Britain, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and other countries.
The US pushed Tuesday to build up the initiative, with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin telling a virtual meeting with 43 countries, the EU and NATO that the attacks ""threaten the free flow of commerce"".bur-mca/cwl

Israel strikes Gaza after failed UN ceasefire bid,"GAZA CITY - Israel pressed its offensive against Hamas militants in Gaza on Saturday after the United States blocked an extraordinary UN bid to call for a ceasefire in the two-month war.
Hamas and the Palestinian Authority swiftly condemned the US veto as the Hamas-run health ministry put the latest death toll in Gaza at 17,487 people, mostly women and children.
An Israeli strike on the southern city of Khan Yunis killed six people, while five others died in a separate attack in Rafah, the ministry said Saturday.
Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas over its unprecedented attack on October 7 when militants broke through Gaza's militarised border to kill around 1,200 people and seize hostages, 138 of whom remain captive, according to Israeli figures.
Vast areas of Gaza have been reduced to rubble and the UN says about 80 percent of the population has been displaced, with dire shortages of food, fuel, water and medicine reported.A UN Security Council resolution that would have called for an immediate ceasefire was vetoed by the United States on Friday.
US envoy Robert Wood said the resolution was ""divorced from reality"" and ""would have not moved the needle forward on the ground"".
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said the ceasefire ""would prevent the collapse of the Hamas terrorist organization, which is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, and would enable it to continue ruling the Gaza Strip"".
Hamas slammed on Saturday the US rejection of the ceasefire bid as ""a direct participation of the occupation in killing our people and committing more massacres and ethnic cleansing"".
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said it was ""a disgrace and another blank cheque given to the occupying state to massacre, destroy and displace"".",Saturday 09 December 2023 - 08:30am
UK broadcast journalists demand open access to Gaza,"More than 50 UK-based broadcast journalists have sent an open letter to the Israeli and Egyptian embassies calling for ""free and unfettered access"" to Gaza for foreign media, British media reported Wednesday.
The letter, from 55 correspondents and presenters from the main broadcasting outlets based in the UK, appealed for better protection for journalists already reporting in the territory.
""Almost five months into the war in Gaza, foreign reporters are still being denied access to the territory, outside of the rare and escorted trips with the Israeli military,"" said the letter, quoted by multiple local media outlets.
""We urge the Governments of Israel and Egypt to allow free and unfettered access to Gaza for all foreign media.""
It called on Israel to openly state its permission for international journalists to operate in Gaza and for the Egyptian authorities to allow international journalists access to the Rafah Crossing between Egypt and Gaza.
Journalists who signed the letter include Alex Crawford from Sky News, Jeremy Bowen from the BBC and Christiane Amanpour from CNN.
Although some journalists have been invited to briefly ""embed"" with the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) for escorted tours inside Gaza, they have been prohibited from talking to any of the Palestinians there.
""There is intense global interest in the events in Gaza and for now the only reporting has come from journalists who were already based there,"" said the letter.
""It's vital that local journalists' safety is respected and that their efforts are bolstered by the journalism of members of the international media. 
""The need for comprehensive on the ground reporting of the conflict is imperative.""
United Nations reports indicate that at least 122 journalists and other media workers have been killed and many others wounded in the Gaza Strip since war erupted there following Hamas's deadly attacks inside Israel on October 7.
The Palestinian militants also killed four Israeli journalists on October 7, while three journalists have been killed by Israeli shelling on the Lebanese side of their border.
Israel's supreme court on January 9 rejected a request from international media for free access to Gaza.
The fighting in Gaza was triggered by Hamas militants' assault on southern Israel, the worst since the country's 1948 founding. Around 1,140 people died in the attack, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Wednesday that at least 29,954 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory during the war between militants and Israel.
The toll includes at least 76 deaths in the past 24 hours, while 70,325 people have been wounded since the conflict began on October 7, a ministry statement said.",Wednesday 28 February 2024 - 14:35pm
Mother of French Gaza hostage demands ceasefire,"Marie-Pascale Radoux has been waiting for three months for news of her son, Orion, still believed held hostage by Hamas in the Gaza Strip after their October 7 attack in Israel.
A painter living near Toulouse in southwest France, Radoux urged Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas to reach ""a ceasefire, or at least a truce, to allow hostages to be freed"".
""There has to be a ceasefire, for the hostages, the civilians, the children, the families, all the hundreds and hundreds of innocent people,"" the 62-year-old added in an interview with AFP. 
""That's what we're asking (Benjamin) Netanyahu,"" Radoux said in reference to the Israeli prime minister. 
On December 13, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly backed a non-binding resolution calling for a ceasefire but the Israeli premier has ruled that out until Hamas is, in his words, ""eliminated"".
""I also ask Hamas to take care of my son because he had physical frailties,"" Radoux added in a worried voice.
Sometimes Radoux notices herself speaking about Franco-Mexican Orion in the past tense, before correcting herself.
""It's because it's been such a long time already,"" she said.
Hardest to bear for Radoux is the lack of any sign of life from her 32-year-old son.
""My anxiety has really intensified recently. I'm doing worse and worse, because...""
She pauses, drawing her blue-green scarf tighter around her shoulders as if to protect herself from the outside world.
- Anger and nightmares -
 
""There are no words to explain what you feel... from anger to sadness, anxiety, fear, nightmares.""
Orion Hernandez Radoux was attending the Tribe of Nova music festival when Hamas entered southern Israel fromt he Gaza Strip on October 7.Some 1,140 people were killed in the attack, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on the Israeli count.
Israel's relentless bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza have killed more than 23,000 people there, most of them women and children, according to the besieged territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
The day of the attack, Orion tried to flee but was caught and taken by the militants into Gaza.
He is believed to still be a prisoner.
But while Orion is named on Israel's official hostage list -- still numbering 132 -- his mother has had no proof that he is still alive.
Her only thread of hope is a phone call from Hamas received by friends of her son ""which said that he was doing fine, that we shouldn't worry, that he was with them and they wouldn't mistreat him"".
That has been little comfort to Radoux, who has been turning over every stone to have her son found or freed -- or at least to finally confirm he is alive.
- 'Do something every day' -
 
""As long as I know I can do something for him every day, that keeps me on my feet,"" she said, her French slipping into the Spanish idioms she picked up during her 25 years in Mexico.
""The days when nothing happens are terrible,"" Radoux added. ""Hyperactivity keeps you from not slipping into fear and anxiety.""
Her paintings have fallen by the wayside. A canvas depicting a wolf on a black background stands untouched in the laundry room she uses as a studio.
Normally ""painting... lets you get through moments like this"", she said -- but she now simply has no time for her art.
Another vital support comes from ""messages full of hope"" from her son's many friends.
""It helps to know there are so many people waiting and wishing for his return,"" Radoux said.
""The longer it takes, the harder it gets and most of all people can forget there are hostages"" still in the hands of Hamas, she said.

Israel squeezes Gaza cities ahead of rare UN vote,"Israeli forces squeezed Gaza's main cities Friday, two months after Hamas's deadly attack sparked a war that has killed thousands, left the Palestinian territory in ruins and triggered an extraordinary UN bid for a ceasefire.
Weeks of fighting have left 17,177 people dead in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
Vowing to destroy the Islamist movement, Israel has relentlessly bombarded Gaza and sent in tanks and ground troops since the war began on October 7 with unprecedented attacks by Hamas on southern Israel. Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and took hostages, 138 of whom remain captive, Israel says.Vast areas of Gaza have been reduced to a wasteland. The UN says about 80 percent of the population has been displaced, facing shortages of food, fuel, water and medicine, along with the threat of disease.
On Friday, the health ministry reported another 40 dead in strikes near Gaza City, and dozens more in Jabalia and Khan Yunis.
The military told residents of the Jabalia, Shejaiya and Zeitun districts of Gaza City to move west.
The death toll also rose in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces shot dead six Palestinians on Friday, the territory's health ministry said.Israel's army confirmed that ""during exchanges of fire, a number of terrorists were killed"" and two wanted suspects apprehended in a joint military-intelligence operation.
The armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it had fired more rockets towards Israeli territory.
An attack in Iraq again raised fears of wider conflict, with US officials saying salvoes of rockets targeted the US embassy in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone.
- Blood stains -
This is the first attack against the US mission in Baghdad since the war began, though there have been dozens of rocket or drone strikes by pro-Iran groups against American or coalition forces elsewhere in Iraq as well as in Syria.Thousands of Jordanians demonstrated near the US embassy in Amman to denounce US support for Israel.
In Gaza, fighting raged around cities in the centre and south, including Deir al-Balah, where ambulances carried numerous wounded.
""May God punish those who can see our suffering and remain calm,"" said one Gazan, Rimah Mansi, who told AFP that ""all those we love"" were gone.
Further south, in Al-Katiba district of Khan Yunis, residents emerged to scenes of desolation after Israeli strikes, an AFP journalist said.
The fighting has pushed Gazans further and further south, turning Rafah near the Egyptian border into a vast camp for many of the 1.9 million displaced.
Israel's military released footage of naval forces firing from the Mediterranean towards what it called Hamas infrastructure on shore. Other military video showed what it described as strikes on targets in Khan Yunis.The military said Friday it had killed ""numerous"" militants in Khan Yunis, part of ""extensive battles"" in Gaza, where around 450 targets were struck over 24 hours.
In the north, the military said it found Hamas rocket parts, launchers and other weapons as well as a one-kilometre tunnel, at Al-Azhar University in the Gaza City district of Rimal.
Hamas has said it is battling Israeli troops ""on all axes of the incursion into the Gaza Strip"".
- Civilisation 'about to break down' -
In a phone call Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US President Joe Biden -- whose country provides billions of dollars in military aid to Israel -- ""emphasised the critical need to protect civilians and to separate the civilian population from Hamas"", the White House said.Biden also called for ""corridors that allow people to move safely from defined areas of hostilities"".
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock appealed for ""Israel to adapt its military action"" and allow more humanitarian aid, especially in Gaza's north.
On Thursday, 69 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies and fuel entered Gaza from Egypt, the UN said.
This is well below the average 500 truckloads, including fuel, which entered Gaza daily before the war, it said.The article allows the secretary-general to bring to the council's attention ""any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security"".
Guterres is seeking a ""humanitarian ceasefire"" to prevent ""a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians"" and the entire Middle East.
The World Health Organization reinforced this warning. 
""People are starting to cut down telephone poles to have a little bit of firewood to keep warm or maybe cook, if they have anything available,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said. ""Civilisation is about to break down.""
The Gaza war has killed 91 Israeli soldiers so far. 
- Hanukkah -
Israelis remain deeply traumatised by the Hamas attack and fearful for the fate of hostages as they mark the Jewish festival of lights, Hanukkah, which began Thursday evening.Families and supporters of those still held hostage attended a lighting ceremony of a 138-branched menorah, representing each of the captives.
The war has also led to deadly cross-border exchanges on the Lebanese frontier.
An AFP investigation into October 13 strikes in southern Lebanon that killed a Reuters journalist and injured six others, including two from AFP, found it involved a tank shell only used by the Israeli army in this region.Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the strikes merit a ""war crime"" investigation.
Israel's army said the strikes occurred in an ""active combat zone"" and were under review.

Medics evacuate 31 premature babies from Gaza hospital,"GAZA - Palestinian medics evacuated 31 premature babies from Gaza City's war-torn Al-Shifa hospital Sunday in a high-risk operation, the UN said, pledging to also move patients and staff who remain there. 
The hospital, Gaza's largest, has been described by the UN's World Health Organization (WHO) as a ""death zone"", after it sent a team to visit the facility on Saturday. 
Mohammed Zaqut, director general of hospitals in Gaza, told AFP ""all 31 premature babies in Al-Shifa hospital... have been evacuated"" and said ""preparations are under way"" for them to enter Egypt.
It was also confirmed by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PCRS) which said the transfer had been carried out in coordination with United Nations agencies including the WHO.
Al-Shifa hospital has become a focal point for Israeli operations, with the army claiming Hamas uses it as a base. Hamas, and medical staff, have denied the accusations.
Israel is seeking to destroy the Hamas militants behind the October 7 attacks that Israeli officials say killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw around 240 people taken hostage.
The Hamas health authority says Israel's relentless military campaign has killed more than 12,300 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 31 ""very sick"" babies were moved out of Al-Shifa hospital in six PCRS ambulances under ""extremely intense and high-risk security conditions"". 
They were taken to a hospital in the southern Gaza city of Rafah where they were ""receiving urgent care in the neonatal intensive care unit,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, saying they were accompanied by ""six health workers and 10 staff family members"".
The agency was planning ""further missions... to urgently transport remaining patients and health staff out of Al-Shifa Hospital"", he added, once guarantees of safe passage are secured.
The WHO's initial visit to Al-Shifa came after hundreds fled the hospital on Saturday following what Al-Shifa's director said were Israeli army orders for it to be emptied.  
Israel denied ordering the move. 
An AFP journalist at the scene saw crowds of sick, injured and displaced people walking towards the seafront, with the health ministry saying 120 patients had stayed behind, among them a number of premature babies. 
""Many patients can not leave the hospital as they are in the ICU beds or the baby incubators,"" Ahmed al-Mokhallalati, a doctor at the hospital, wrote Saturday on X, formerly Twitter.
Following its visit to Al-Shifa, the WHO said 291 patients and 25 health workers were still inside the hospital, figures issued several hours before the babies were evacuated.
Since November 11, when fuel supplies ran out at Al-Shifa, eight babies died due to the lack of electricity to run incubator units, the health ministry has said.",Sunday 19 November 2023 - 18:54pm
Israeli strikes rock Gaza for second day after truce collapse,"JERUSALEM - Israel carried out deadly bombardments in Gaza for a second day on Saturday after a week-long truce with Hamas collapsed despite international calls for an extension.
Clouds of grey smoke from the strikes hung over Gaza, where the Hamas-run health ministry said nearly 200 people had been killed since the pause in hostilities expired early Friday.
Both sides blamed each other for breaking the truce, with Israel claiming that Hamas had tried to fire a rocket before it ended and failed to produce a list of further hostages for release.
""What we're doing now is striking Hamas military targets all over the Gaza Strip,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Jonathan Conricus told reporters on Saturday.
As hostilities resumed, Hamas's armed wing received ""the order to resume combat"" and to ""defend the Gaza Strip"", according to a source close to the group who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media.
International leaders and humanitarian groups condemned the return to fighting.
""I deeply regret that military operations have started again in Gaza,"" UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said on X, formerly Twitter.Fears of a wider regional conflict grew after the Syrian defence ministry said Israeli strikes had hit Damascus on Saturday and the militant group Hezbollah said one of its members had been killed in an Israeli strike on Lebanon on Friday.
The United States said it is working with regional partners to reach another ceasefire.
""We're going to continue to work with Israel and Egypt and Qatar on efforts to reimplement the pause,"" US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters in California on Friday.
 
- 'Mother of all thumpings' -
 
During an unprecedented attack on October 7, Hamas fighters broke through Gaza's militarised border into Israel, killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped around 240, according to Israeli authorities.Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response and unleashed an air and ground campaign that has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, the Hamas authorities who run Gaza say.
The Israeli army said on Friday that five of the hostages seized by Hamas had died, and that the Islamist group was still holding ""136 hostages, including 17 women and children"".
Seven days of hostage-prisoner exchanges had yielded tearful reunions of Israeli families with their released relatives and jubilation in the streets of the occupied West Bank as Palestinian prisoners walked free from Israeli jails.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Dubai that the United States remained ""intensely focused on getting everyone home, getting hostages back"" and ""pursuing the process that had worked for seven days"" during the truce.
But Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told reporters: ""Having chosen to hold onto our women, Hamas will now take the mother of all thumpings.""The Israeli military said that ""ground, air and naval forces struck terror targets in the north and south of the Gaza Strip, including in Khan Yunis and Rafah.""
Outside the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, a man in a blue sweater bellowed in grief and turned his face and hands to the sky after viewing a dead boy in a body bag, AFPTV footage showed.
""What did he do wrong? God, what did we do to deserve this?"" he yelled.
 
- 'Horror movie' -
 
Guterres has warned of a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" in Gaza, where the United Nations says 1.7 million people are displaced and short of food, water and other essentials.""The healthcare service is on its knees,"" Rob Holden, a World Health Organization (WHO) senior emergency officer, told journalists from Gaza as explosions were heard in the background.
""It is like a horror movie.""
On a bed at Khan Yunis's Nasser hospital, Amal Abu Dagga wept, her beige veil covered in blood.
""I don't even know what happened to my children,"" she said. A relative, Jamil Abu Dagga, told AFP the family had been at home when the bombs started falling.
In Israel, sirens warning of potential missiles sounded in several communities near Gaza. Authorities said they were restarting security measures in the area, including closing schools.
A rocket strike destroyed a van in one Israeli community near Gaza.
 
- 'Evacuation zones' -
 
Mediation efforts by Qatar and Egypt were ongoing, said a source briefed on the talks who asked not to be named.During the seven-day truce, Hamas freed 80 Israeli hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners, and more aid entered Gaza.
Twenty-five other hostages, mostly Thais, were also freed in separate arrangements.
The Israeli military published a map of ""evacuation zones"" in the Gaza Strip that it said would enable residents to ""evacuate from specific places for their safety if required"".
Residents in various areas of Gaza were sent SMS warnings on Friday.
Israeli forces ""will begin a crushing military attack on your area of residence with the aim of eliminating the terrorist organisation Hamas,"" the warnings said.
""Stay away from all military activity of every kind.""
 
- Children held hostage -
 
On Thursday, eight Israeli hostages, some holding dual nationality, were released in the seventh round of exchanges under the truce.
The country's prison service later said another 30 Palestinian prisoners -- 23 minors and seven women -- had been freed.
Hamas said it had offered to hand over the bodies of a mother and her two sons -- one of them a baby -- in talks to extend the now-expired truce.Shiri Bibas, her 10-month-old son Kfir and his four-year-old brother Ariel, along with their father Yarden, have become emblematic of the October 7 attacks.
Hours after the truce collapsed, Israeli bombardment killed three people in southern Lebanon, one of them a Hezbollah member, according to the Iran-backed militant group.
Hezbollah meanwhile claimed its first attacks on Israel since the truce ended.

EU eyes call for 'humanitarian corridors and pauses' in Gaza,"BRUSSELS - EU leaders will on Thursday debate calling for humanitarian ""pauses"" in Israel's war with Hamas, as the bloc weighs how to respond to another conflict as fighting rages in Ukraine.
The European Union has struggled for both unity and influence in the face of the crisis that has engulfed the Middle East since Hamas launched its attack on Israel on October 7.
The surge in bloodshed has stretched Europe's attention at a time of rising doubts about the West's ability to keep supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia.
The 27-nation bloc has long been split between more pro-Palestinian members such as Ireland and Spain, and staunch backers of Israel including Germany and Austria.
There has been strong condemnation of the Hamas attack that Israel says killed at least 1,400 people and resulted in more than 200 being taken hostage. 
But there has been less consensus on urging any halt to Israel's retaliatory bombardment of Gaza, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed over 6,500 people.
After days of negotiations, the latest draft statement for the summit, seen by AFP, calls for ""humanitarian corridors and pauses"".
That was updated from an earlier draft that had the formulation ""a humanitarian pause"" so that aid can reach civilians in Gaza.
That statement -- which could still change when leaders meet in Brussels -- falls short of demands from the United Nations for a ""ceasefire"".
Germany, wary of urging a more definitive halt that could tie Israel's hands, had argued for the call to be humanitarian ""windows"" or ""pauses"" in the plural.
""Letters, commas, language matter, and that's how you find agreements,"" said a senior EU official. 
But diplomats from some EU nations warn that delays over finding the right words as the death toll mounts are hitting the bloc's global standing and leaving it flailing in the face of developments.
The summit was taking place after Israel said it sent tanks and infantry into Gaza on an overnight raid before pulling back to home soil. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared preparations for a ground war are under way. 
 
- Ukraine overshadowed? - 
 
The eruption of violence in the Middle East has sparked fears the West could get distracted from Russia's war on Ukraine 20 months into the invasion.
The fresh crisis comes at a moment when turmoil in the US Congress has raised questions about the sustainability of Washington's military aid.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Tuesday that ""support will in no way be impacted by the fact that we of course since the horrible morning hours of October 7 have focused on Israel and the Middle East"".
Chief among EU measures meant to reassure Kyiv is a plan -- earlier estimated at 20 billion euros ($21 billion) over four years -- for a defence fund for Ukraine as part of broader Western security commitments.
Diplomats say progress has been held up by Hungary, Russia's closest ally in the bloc, and leaders are set to task the bloc's foreign policy chief to report back on the issue in December.   
There will also be calls to impose new sanctions on Moscow that could include banning Russian diamond imports once the G7 agrees on a way of tracing them.
In addition, a plan for using the revenues from frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine will be discussed.
Looming over the discussion on Ukraine will be the country's next steps in its push to join the EU.
The bloc's executive arm is to give an assessment on November 8 on whether to open formal accession talks with Kyiv.
Then it will be up to EU leaders to decide whether to adopt any recommendations by the end of the year.

Israel to defend itself against Gaza genocide case at UN top court,"THE HAGUE - Israel will on Friday hit back at what it describes as ""atrocious"" allegations it is committing ""genocide"" in Gaza, in a closely watched landmark case before the UN's top court.
South Africa has launched an emergency case at the International Court of Justice arguing that Israel stands in breach of the UN Genocide Convention, signed in 1948 in the wake of the Holocaust.
Pretoria wants judges to force Israel to ""immediately"" stop the Gaza campaign launched after the devastating October 7 Hamas attacks, which left 1,140 dead, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Israel has responded with a relentless military campaign that has killed at least 23,469 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.
Israel and its ally the United States have dismissed the case as groundless and vowed a robust defence at the Peace Palace in The Hague, which houses the ICJ.
""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas,"" said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the run-up to the hearings.
""We will continue our defensive war, the justice and morality of which is without peer,"" he added.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the South African case was ""unfounded"". 
""In fact, it is those who are violently attacking Israel who continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews,"" said Miller.
The ICJ will likely rule within a matter of weeks on South Africa's request. Its rulings are final and legally binding but it has little power to enforce them.
A month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the ICJ ordered a halt to the military operation -- to no avail.
 
- 'Crossed the line' -
 
For this emergency proceeding, the court will not rule on the fundamentals of the case -- whether Israel is actually committing genocide -- but on whether the rights of Gazans to exist are at risk.
South Africa can bring an ICJ case against Israel as both countries have signed the Genocide Convention.Justice Minister Ronald Lamola told the court on Thursday that Israel had ""crossed the line"" and was in breach of the Convention.
He said that even the brutality of the Hamas attack could not justify this. 
""Genocides are never declared in advance,"" said Adila Hassim, a top lawyer for South Africa.
""But this court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts.""
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has long been a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause, often linking it to its own struggle against the white-minority government, which had cooperative relations with Israel.
Anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela famously said South Africa's freedom would be ""incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians"".
Addressing the ICJ on Thursday, lawyer for South Africa Blinne Ni Ghralaigh said international justice itself was on the line.
""Some might say that the very reputation of international law, its ability and will to bind and protect all peoples equally, hangs in the balance,"" she told the court.
But Israel described South Africa as the ""legal arm"" of Hamas and said Pretoria's case was ""one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history"".

UN warns Gaza 'uninhabitable' as war rages on,"Israel bombed southern Gaza early Saturday as the UN warned the besieged Palestinian territory has been rendered ""uninhabitable"" by three months of war.
The fighting, triggered by the October 7 attacks on southern Israel by Hamas militants, has sent tensions soaring across the region, and shows no signs of abating as the conflict slides into its fourth month on Sunday.
Civilians in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip have born the brunt of the violence amid widespread displacement, destruction and a deepening humanitarian crisis.
With much of the territory already reduced to rubble, UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said Friday that ""Gaza has simply become uninhabitable"".
AFP correspondents reported Israeli strikes early Saturday on the southern city of Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of people have sought shelter from the fighting.On Israel's northern border, Lebanon's Hezbollah group said it launched on Saturday its ""initial response"" to the killing of Hamas's deputy chief in Beirut, which a US defence official has told AFP was carried out by Israel.
The Iran-backed group said it had targeted the Israeli military's Meron air control base with 62 missiles, while the Israeli army reported ""approximately 40 launches from Lebanon"" early Saturday, with sirens blaring in the Galilee region.
The Hamas-allied Lebanese movement has been trading near-daily fire with Israeli forces since early October and said the barrage was a response to Tuesday's killing of Saleh al-Aruri in a strike on a Hezbollah stronghold in the Lebanese capital.The army said it had responded with a strike on a Hezbollah ""cell that took part in the launches"".
Military spokesman Daniel Hagari said late Friday that Israeli forces were maintaining a ""very high state of readiness"" along the border with Lebanon following Aruri's killing, which Israel has not claimed.
In Gaza, Hagari said, the army continues ""to fight ... in the north, centre and south"".
Palestinian man Abu Mohammed, 60, who fled to Rafah from the central Bureij refugee camp, told AFP that as the war nears its fourth month, Gaza's future appeared ""dark and gloomy and very difficult"".
- Hospital 'overcrowded with displaced' -
The war began with an unprecedented Hamas attack on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
The militants also took around 250 hostages, 132 of whom remain in captivity, according to Israel, including at least 24 believed to have been killed.In response, Israel has launched a relentless bombardment and ground invasion that have killed at least 22,600 people, most of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society on Friday reported shelling and drone fire in the area around Al-Amal hospital in Khan Yunis.
It said seven displaced people, including a five-day-old baby, had been killed while sheltering in the compound.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says the majority of the Palestinian territory's 36 hospitals have been put out of action by the fighting, while remaining medical facilities face dire shortages.
In central Gaza, a spokesman for the Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital said: ""We are facing a humanitarian catastrophe due to the spread of epidemics, with the hospital overcrowded with displaced people.""
A UN team on Friday delivered medical supplies to Gaza authorities in Khan Yunis, and WHO coordinator Sean Casey said it was ""the first time we've been able to make this delivery in about 10 days.""""Hospitals have been running short on some supplies,"" he said, adding that medical facilities were ""working at two or three times their normal capacity.""
The Israeli military on Saturday said its ground and air forces had ""killed numerous terrorists ... and destroyed a number of tunnel shaft"" in Khan Yunis over the past 24 hours.
Israel says Hamas militants hide in a vast underground network as well as among civilians in schools and hospitals.
The army said that during ""a targeted raid"" in Gaza City, now a largely devastated urban combat zone, troops had found military vests ""concealed... in a medical clinic"".
- Diplomatic push -Top Western diplomats were in the region as part of a fresh push to raise the flow of aid into Gaza and calm rising tensions.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Turkey on Saturday, where he was due to discuss the Gaza war with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Blinken will also visit several Arab states before heading to Israel and the occupied West Bank next week.
During his visit, Blinken plans to discuss with Israeli leaders ""immediate measures to increase substantially humanitarian assistance to Gaza"", State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.
The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell was meeting Lebanese leaders on Saturday in Beirut for talks on ""all aspects of the situation in and around Gaza"".
Germany's top diplomat, Annalena Baerbock, was also due to travel to the region on Sunday, a foreign ministry spokesman said.""It's not up to Israel to determine the future of Gaza, which is Palestinian land,"" Colonna told CNN on Friday.

Gaza ceasefire and hostage release to start Friday,"GAZA - A pause in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza will start on Friday morning with the first hostages to be released hours later, mediator Qatar said, after nearly seven weeks of fighting.
Families of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and of Palestinians detained by Israel were forced to wait an extra day after the breakthrough four-day truce deal was put on hold.
Qatar, which facilitated the truce deal along with Egypt and the United States, said the pause would begin Friday at 7:00 am with the ""first batch"" of 13 civilian hostages being handed over about nine hours later.
The armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, confirmed the ceasefire would start at 7:00 am under the deal that is also intended to provide aid to Gaza's 2.4 million residents struggling to survive with shortages of food, water and fuel.
""The truce applies for four days, starting from Friday morning, accompanied by the cessation of all military actions from the Qassam Brigades and the Palestinian resistance, as well as the Zionist enemy throughout the truce period,"" it said.
The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was in contact with the families of the hostages after receiving ""a first list of names"" for those due to be released. It did not specify who was on the list.Instead of a pause, fighting raged on Thursday. Explosions were heard on an AFPTV livecam and heavy grey clouds hovering over the territory's north, much of which has been reduced to rubble.
""We've already been on an emotional roller coaster for 47 days. Today is no different,"" said Eyal Kalderon, a cousin of Ofer Kalderon, who is among those held captive in Gaza.
- Release 'will take place' -
Hamas and other Palestinian gunmen seized about 240 hostages during unprecedented raids into Israel on October 7 which Israel says killed around 1,200 people, most of them civilians.
The attack prompted a relentless Israeli campaign of bombing and a ground offensive in Gaza, where the Hamas government says more than 14,100 people, also mostly non-combatants, have been killed.Israel's national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi had earlier indicated the phased release of at least 50 hostages in return for 150 Palestinian prisoners would still go ahead, but not before Friday.
On both sides it would free mostly women and people aged 18 and under. The Palestinians are to be freed from three Israeli jails.
Three Americans, including three-year-old Abigail Mor Idan, are among those earmarked to be freed.Governments around the world have welcomed the deal, with some expressing hope it will lead to a lasting end to the war.
""This cannot be just a pause before the massacre starts all over again,"" Riyad Mansour, Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council.
Israeli officials, however, say the truce will be only temporary.
""We are not ending the war. We will continue until we are victorious,"" Israel's chief of staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, told troops he visited in Gaza, according to the army.
- Weeks of talks -
The release deal came after weeks of talks involving Israel, Palestinian militant groups, Qatar, Egypt and the United States.Israel's aerial bombardment continued overnight on targets in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, sending red and yellow fireballs and immense columns of black smoke into the air.
Homes shook several kilometres (miles) away in Rafah, AFP journalists said.
""I think there are still about 20 people under the rubble,"" said one Palestinian looking for survivors under a destroyed building east of Khan Yunis.
Thousands of children have been killed in Gaza, ""the most dangerous place in the world to be a child"", said Catherine Russell, executive director of the UN children's fund, UNICEF.Youngsters are among the estimated 1.7 million Gazans who, according to the UN, have had to flee their homes during the fighting.
Hospital patients have also been forced to move, the latest being 190 wounded and sick, along with their companions and medical teams, from Al-Shifa hospital on Wednesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.
Under pressure to back up its claims that Hamas had a command centre under Al-Shifa, Israel's military on Wednesday escorted journalists to a tunnel shaft which soldiers said was part of a vast Hamas underground military network.
The army led reporters into underground facilities with air-conditioning, a toilet and what looked like a kitchenette.Hamas and medical staff have denied a command centre is under Al-Shifa, Gaza's largest hospital.
Israeli forces arrested Al-Shifa's director Mohammad Abu Salmiya and other medical personnel, another doctor told AFP on Thursday.
Since the Israel-Hamas war began, deadly exchanges of fire have gripped Israel's northern border, mainly between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.
These clashes have raised fears of a broader conflagration.
- Tearful refuge -
Hezbollah said Thursday that its chief, Hassan Nasrallah, met with Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian to discuss ""the efforts made to end the Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip"".In the Red Sea, the destroyer USS Thomas Hudner ""shot down multiple one-way attack drones launched from Huthi-controlled areas in Yemen"", United States Central Command said, referring to the Iran-backed rebel group.
Displaced Gazans remained sceptical about the Israel-Hamas deal.
Fatima Achour, a Palestinian lawyer in her 40s, burst into tears when she reached Egypt through the Rafah border crossing, becoming one of the few Gazans allowed to leave because she has a foreign passport.
""There's no city to go back to... There are no houses. Our lives have ended,"" she said. ""This truce is not for us.""

Hamas attack does not justify Gaza's destruction: Red Cross,"The massive Hamas attack on Israel cannot justify the ""limitless destruction"" of the Gaza Strip, the Red Cross said Friday, as it called for pauses in the fighting.
Its statement came as Israel's army on Friday warned residents in north Gaza to flee south ahead of an expected ground offensive.
Israel's siege of Gaza is in response to the weekend attack by Hamas, whose gunmen launched the deadliest ever attack on Israel.
""Nothing can justify the horrific attacks Israel suffered last weekend,"" said a statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross.
""Our hearts go out to people who lost family members or are worried sick about loved ones taken hostage. We reiterate our call for their immediate release and stand ready to conduct humanitarian visits,"" the ICRC said.
""But those attacks cannot in turn justify the limitless destruction of Gaza.
""The parties must not neglect their legal obligations regarding the methods and means used to wage war.""
Hamas fighters broke through the militarised border barrier around the Gaza Strip last Saturday, killing more than 1,300 people in Israel. They also took an estimated 150 hostages back to the enclave.
Israel has retaliated to Hamas's attacks by hitting targets in Gaza with thousands of strikes, which have killed more than 1,530 people.
- 'Nowhere safe to go' -
Israel has cut off water, food and power supplies to Gaza in a total siege it has vowed will not end until all hostages are freed.
""The instructions issued by the Israeli authorities for the population of Gaza City to immediately leave their homes, coupled with the complete siege explicitly denying them food, water, and electricity, are not compatible with international humanitarian law,"" the ICRC said.""When military powers order people to leave their homes, all possible measures must be taken to ensure the population has access to basic necessities like food and water and that members of the same family are not separated.""
The ICRC said Gazans had ""nowhere safe to go"" and it was ""impossible"" for them to know which areas ""will next face attack"".
Many would not be able to leave their homes, and international law protected all civilians, including those who remain, the humanitarian organisation stressed.
""Our teams will require pauses in the fighting to work safely and effectively,"" the ICRC said.
The needs in Gaza were ""staggering"", it added, but with a military siege in place, humanitarian organisations ""will not be able to assist such a massive displacement of people in Gaza"".",Friday 13 October 2023 - 17:02pm

Israeli tanks in overnight Gaza raid ahead of 'next stage',"Israel sent tanks, troops and armoured bulldozers into the Gaza Strip in a ""targeted raid"" overnight that destroyed multiple sites before withdrawing from the Hamas-run territory, the army said Thursday. 
Black smoke billowed into the night sky after a blast in the grainy night-vision footage the military released hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared preparations for a ground war were underway.
On the 20th day of Israel's deadliest Gaza war yet, that has already killed thousands, the army said its forces had hit ""numerous terrorist cells, infrastructure and anti-tank missile launch posts"". The operation in northern Gaza came in ""preparation for the next stages of combat"", it said, adding that the soldiers had ""returned to Israeli territory"".
The black-and-white video showed a column of armoured vehicles moving near Gaza's border fence. Other footage appeared to show an air strike and buildings being struck with munitions, sending debris flying high into the air.
Just hours earlier, Netanyahu had delivered a nationally televised address to Israelis still grieving and furious after Hamas's bloody October 7 attacks, telling them ""we are in the midst of a campaign for our existence"".The shock attack, the worst in the country's history, saw throngs of Hamas gunmen pour from Gaza into Israel, killing more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping 224 more, according to official tallies.
Israel has retaliated with relentless strikes that Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said has killed more than 6,500, also mainly civilians -- a toll expected to rise substantially if Israeli troops massed near Gaza move in.
That scenario has further heightened international alarm as shock is growing about the scale of human suffering inside the besieged territory where Israel has cut off most water, food, fuel and other basic supplies.In southern Gaza, a bereaved Palestinian woman, Umm Omar al-Khaldi, recounted to AFP how she witnessed her neighbours being killed in an Israeli strike that reduced the house to rubble, with many feared buried beneath.
""We saw them getting bombarded -- the children got bombarded while their mother was hugging them,"" the woman said, desperately pleading for help from the outside world.
""Where are the Arabs, where is humanity?"" she said. ""Have mercy on us, have mercy on us.""
- 'Nowhere is safe' -The war's surging death toll is by far the highest since Israel unilaterally withdrew from the small coastal territory in 2005 -- a period that has seen four previous Gaza wars.
Entire neighbourhoods have been razed, surgeons are operating without anaesthetic on some of the wounded, and ice-cream trucks have become makeshift morgues.
In chaotic scenes, volunteer emergency crew and neighbours have clawed, sometimes with their bare hands, through broken concrete and sand to pull out civilian casualties.
All too often they recover only their corpses, which have piled up, wrapped in blood-stained white shrouds.""Nowhere is safe in Gaza,"" said Lynne Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories.
US President Joe Biden, a strong supporter of Israel, has joined the calls for it to ""protect innocent civilians"" and to follow the ""laws of war"" as it pursues Hamas targets.
Leaders of the 27-member European Union were on Thursday debating whether to call for a ""humanitarian pause"" in the war to deliver desperately needed aid.French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking in Cairo on Wednesday, warned that ""a massive intervention that would put civilian lives at risk would be an error"".
And Jordan's King Abdullah said anger at the suffering could ""lead to an explosion"" in the Middle East.
- 'Raining down hellfire' -Netanyahu -- amid the growing calls to temper the ferocious bombing campaign -- said that Israel had been ""raining down hellfire on Hamas"" and killing ""thousands of terrorists"".
He said his war cabinet and the military would determine the timing of a ""ground offensive"" with the goal to ""eliminate Hamas"" and ""bring our captives home"".
But he stressed that ""I will not detail when, how or how many"" forces would take part.
Netanyahu also acknowledged for the first time that he would have to explain the security lapses exposed on October 7.""The fault will be examined and everyone will have to give answers, including me,"" he said. ""But all this will happen later.""
Biden, also contemplating the future, stressed that ""when this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next"".
He reiterated that Washington supports a two-state solution with independent Israeli and Palestinian states.
""It means a concentrated effort for all the parties -- Israelis, Palestinians, regional partners, global leaders -- to put us on a path toward peace,"" said the US president.
For now though, the raging war has sparked fears of a regional conflagration if it draws in more of Israel's enemies such as Iran-backed Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
There has also been a rise of attacks on Israel's top ally the United States, which has a vast network of military bases across the Middle East.About 2,500 American troops are stationed in Iraq and some 900 in Syria to help fight remnants of the Islamic State jihadist group.
The Pentagon said there were 10 attacks on US and allied forces in Iraq and three in Syria between October 17 and 24, involving a ""mix of one-way attack drones and rockets.""

Biden calls on Hamas to accept ceasefire by Ramadan,"WASHINGTON - US President Joe Biden called on Hamas on Tuesday to accept a Gaza ceasefire deal by the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, while the Palestinian militant group warned talks for a truce and hostage release cannot go on ""indefinitely"".
As famine threatens Gazans, US and Jordanian planes again airdropped food aid into the besieged territory of 2.4 million people in a joint operation with Egypt and France.
US Vice President Kamala Harris has expressed ""deep concern about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza"", while the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported children dying of starvation in two northern Gaza hospitals.
Envoys from Hamas and the United States have been meeting Qatari and Egyptian mediators in Cairo for negotiations over a six-week truce, the exchange of dozens of remaining hostages for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and the flow of aid to Gaza.
Egypt's Al-Qahera News, which is close to the country's intelligence services, said the talks would continue for a fourth consecutive day on Wednesday.
Biden warned Hamas to agree to a Gaza truce by Ramadan, which begins early next week, after his top diplomat Antony Blinken urged it to accept an ""immediate ceasefire"".
""It's in the hands of Hamas right now,"" the US president told reporters from Maryland.
""There's got to be a ceasefire because Ramadan -- if we get into circumstances where this continues to Ramadan, Israel and Jerusalem could be very, very dangerous.""
He did not elaborate but the United States urged Israel last week to allow Muslims to worship at the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem during Ramadan.
The Israeli government said it would allow Muslim worshippers access to Al-Aqsa during Ramadan ""in similar numbers to those in previous years"".",Wednesday 06 March 2024 - 08:30am
Gaza's embattled main hospital buries patients in mass grave,"Gaza's main hospital has been forced to bury scores of dead patients in a mass grave, its director said Tuesday, as US President Joe Biden pressed Israel to protect the complex trapped in fierce combat.
Israeli forces were at the gates of the sprawling Al-Shifa hospital they say sits atop an underground Hamas command base, but the militants deny the charge and doctors say thousands of people are stranded inside in horrific conditions.
""There are bodies littered in the hospital complex and there is no longer electricity at the morgues,"" said Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiyah, adding that 179 bodies had been interred so far.
""We were forced to bury them in a mass grave,"" he said, adding that seven babies and 29 intensive care patients were among those who had died after fuel for the hospital's generator ran out.
A witness said the smell of decomposing bodies was everywhere in the facility, but nighttime fighting and air strikes had been less intense compared to previous nights.The United Nations believes that thousands, and perhaps more than 10,000 people -- patients, staff and displaced civilians -- may be inside and unable to escape because of fierce fighting nearby.
Israel says it is not targeting the hospital, but has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the attacks of October 7, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, mostly civilians and resulted in 240 hostages being taken to Gaza.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says Israel's relentless assault has killed 11,240 people, also mostly civilians, including thousands of children.
Israel's military says 47 of its troops have been killed in Gaza.
Biden called on Israel to use ""less intrusive action relative to the hospital"", some of his most pointed comments on Israeli operations to date. ""The hospital must be protected,"" he told reporters, as international outrage builds over the death and suffering the war has inflicted on Gaza civilians.
Israel's top diplomat acknowledged Monday that his nation has ""two or three weeks until international pressure really steps up"".
Quoted by his spokesman, Foreign Minister Eli Cohen added that Israel is working to ""broaden the window of legitimacy, and the fighting will carry on for as long as necessary."" 
- 'We are civilians' -
Hamas's brutal attacks of October 7 and Israel's massive response have sparked protests around the world, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets in the Middle East, Europe and beyond.Israel's supporters insist it must protect citizens after the worst attack in the country's 75-year history.
But Israel's critics point to the toll of a blockade and near-relentless bombing campaign on long-suffering civilians in Gaza.
International aid agencies speak of hundreds of thousands of people displaced and a rolling humanitarian catastrophe. 
Israel has urged Palestinians to flee south from the heavy combat in the north of the besieged territory, and has agreed to daily pauses in military operations around specified ""corridors"" to allow the passage of fleeing civilians.
But escaping the fighting is dangerous and wounded Palestinians told AFP how they were hit by a strike on their way south.""I walked around three to four kilometres (around two miles) while I was bleeding,"" said Hasan Baker, whose head and left hand were bandaged. ""There was no possibility for any ambulance to enter the area. 
""We didn't have any weapons,"" he added. ""We are civilians, we were moving from one place to another according to the instructions of the (Israeli) occupation.""
- Hostage talks -
Israeli leaders have so far insisted there will be no broader ceasefire until hostages are released, but Qatar is mediating talks on a possible deal to free hostages.
Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas's military wing, said Monday that a possible deal would involve the release 100 Israeli hostages in return for 200 Palestinian children and 75 women held in Israeli prisons.
""We informed the mediators we could release the hostages if we obtained five days of truce... and passage of aid to all of our people throughout the Gaza Strip, but the enemy is procrastinating,"" Abu Obeida said in an audio statement.
Biden said he was ""somewhat hopeful"" the Qatar-mediated talks could lead to a deal.As security officials and diplomats continued negotiations, Hamas's military wing issued a video of captive Israeli soldier Noa Marciano.
The Israeli army on Tuesday confirmed she was dead.
Abu Obeida, the spokesman for Hamas's military wing, claimed Marciano was killed in an Israeli strike. The Israeli army did not say how she was killed.
- Fear of violence spreading -
Israel released new video showing its troops operating among a ruined Gaza landscape, and massive aerial bombardment that shattered the buildings it targeted.  Army spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops ""found signs that indicate that Hamas held hostages"" in the basement of Al-Rantisi children's hospital, showing footage of a baby bottle and a rope near a chair.AFP could not independently confirm his allegations.
The war in Gaza has also spurred violence on other fronts.
In the occupied West Bank, eight Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli troops, seven during an army raid on the northern city of Tulkarem and one near the southern city of Hebron, the Palestinian health ministry said on Tuesday.
After repeated attacks on US forces in the Middle East, the United States launched air strikes that killed at least eight pro-Iran fighters in eastern Syria, a Britain-based monitoring group said.
On Monday, Israel used fighter jets to strike what it said were ""operational command centres"" belonging to Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah inside Lebanon.

Blinken on Middle East crisis tour as bloody war roils Gaza,"TEL AVIV - US top diplomat Antony Blinken visited the occupied West Bank on Sunday, part of a whirlwind Middle East tour as Israel pursues its deadliest campaign yet in besieged Gaza to destroy Hamas.
Blinken met Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas who denounced what he labelled a ""genocide"" in Gaza, where the Hamas-run health ministry said at least 9,770 people had been killed in more than four weeks of war.
Washington has rebuffed calls for a ceasefire and backed Israel's goal of crushing Hamas who staged the deadliest attack in the country's history on October 7, killing more than 1,400 people and taking over 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. Global concern has soared over the spiralling Gaza death toll, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again vowed that ""there won't be a ceasefire until the hostages are returned. Let them remove this from their lexicon. 
""We are saying this to our enemies and to our friends,"" the veteran right-wing premier said after meeting troops at an air force base. ""We will simply continue until we win. We have no alternative.""
Ground battles raged again in northern Gaza, where Israeli troops tightened their encirclement of Gaza City. Soldiers were seen engaged in house-to-house combat as tanks and armoured bulldozers churned through the sand in footage released by the army.""This strike is like an earthquake,"" Gaza City resident Alaa Abu Hasera said while surveying damaged buildings in the devastated area where entire blocks have been reduced to rubble.
Blinken, in his sit-down talks with Abbas, said Palestinians in Gaza ""must not be forcibly displaced"", a US State Department spokesman said, after Blinken earlier urged ""humanitarian pauses"" to the fighting.
Israel has repeatedly urged Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza to head south, in leaflets and text messages, but a US official said Saturday at least 350,000 civilians remained in what is now an urban war zone.
Abbas denounced ""the genocide and destruction suffered by our Palestinian people in Gaza at the hands of Israel's war machine, with no regard for the principles of international law,"" according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
 
- 'Stop extremist violence' -
 Israel has relentlessly pounded the besieged Gaza Strip in its battle to destroy Hamas, levelling entire city blocks and killing thousands, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
""Right now, parents in Gaza do not know whether they can feed their children today and whether they will even survive to see tomorrow,"" said Cindy McCain, head of the World Food Programme.
Blinken last week told a Senate hearing Abbas's Palestinian Authority should retake control of Gaza after the war. It currently exercises only limited autonomy in parts of the West Bank and Netanyahu has long sought to sideline it. 
Abbas said Sunday the Palestinian Authority could return to power in Gaza in future only if a ""comprehensive political solution"" is found for the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
Washington has said it backs a Palestinian state alongside Israel, but Netanyahu's hard-right government has been implacably opposed.The war has exacerbated tensions in the West Bank, where more than 150 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces and in settler attacks, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
In the West Bank city of Jenin, bulldozers on Sunday cleared the smoke-blackened rubble of buildings officials said were burnt in a nighttime Israeli raid. 
Blinken and Abbas discussed ""the need to stop extremist violence against Palestinians"" in the West Bank, the State Department said.
 
- 'Stain on humanity' - 
 
Since Israel sent ground forces into the north of the narrow Palestinian territory late last month, ""over 2,500 terror targets have been struck"" by ""ground, air and naval forces"", the army said on Sunday.Images from the Gaza Strip showed civilians heading south away from the fighting, though Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told foreign reporters Hamas was using roadblocks to try to prevent them from fleeing.
The Hamas-run health ministry said Israeli bombing of Al-Maghazi refugee camp late Saturday killed 45 people, with an eyewitness reporting children dead and homes smashed.
""An Israeli air strike targeted my neighbours' house in Al-Maghazi camp, my house next door partially collapsed,"" said Mohammed Alaloul, 37, a journalist working for the Turkish Anadolu Agency.
He told AFP the bombing killed four of his children as well as four of his brothers and several of his nieces and nephews.Blinken faced a rising tide of anger in meetings with Arab foreign ministers in Jordan on Saturday, where he reaffirmed US support for ""humanitarian pauses"" to ensure desperate civilians get help.
The incoming US ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, said on Sunday the October 7 Hamas attack was ""a stain on humanity that cannot happen again"", while presenting his credentials to President Isaac Herzog.
 
- 'Not a war, a massacre' -
 
Blinken, meanwhile, left the West Bank for Cyprus, the nearest EU member state to Israel and the Gaza Strip, which has said it is working towards establishing a maritime corridor for aid to Gaza. Later Blinken was expected in Turkey whose President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has held Netanyahu personally responsible for Gaza's growing civilian death toll.
Turkey on Saturday said it was recalling its ambassador to Israel and breaking off contacts with Netanyahu.
International concern mounted over the suffering.
French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, on a visit to Qatar, called for ""an immediate, durable and observed humanitarian truce"" that could ""lead to a ceasefire"".
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, whose country has been acting as the sole conduit for foreigners to escape the Gaza Strip and for aid to get in, on Saturday called for an ""immediate and comprehensive ceasefire"".
That call was echoed by thousands of protesters in Washington in solidarity with Palestinians, one of multiple rallies held from Indonesia to Iran as well as in European cities.""The violence in Gaza has been prolonged and indiscriminate -- it's not a war but a massacre,"" 27-year-old protester Dwi Nurfitriani said during a march in Jakarta.
Thousands also demonstrated in Israel on Saturday as pressure mounts on Netanyahu over his government's lack of preparedness for the October 7 attacks and its handling of the hostage crisis.
Hundreds protested outside Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence calling on him to resign while in Tel Aviv relatives and friends of some of the hostages chanted ""bring them home now"".

Hamas heads to Cairo truce talks as Rafah braces for Israeli assault,"JERUSALEM - Negotiations to pause the Israel-Hamas war and free the remaining hostages headed into a second day in Cairo on Wednesday, as displaced Gazans braced for an expected Israeli assault on their last refuge of Rafah. 
A Hamas source told AFP that a delegation was headed to the Egyptian capital to meet Egyptian and Qatari mediators, after Israeli negotiators held talks with the mediators on Tuesday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an outspoken critic of Israel's conduct of the Gaza war, was also due in Cairo Wednesday for talks with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
CIA Director William Burns had joined Tuesday's talks with David Barnea, head of Israel's Mossad intelligence service, which Egyptian media said had been mostly ""positive"". US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby described the negotiations as ""constructive and moving in the right direction"".
Mediators are racing to secure a pause to the fighting before Israel proceeds with a full-scale ground incursion into the Gaza Strip's far-southern city of Rafah, where more than 1.4 million Palestinians are trapped.
The potential for mass civilian casualties has triggered urgent appeals, even from close allies, for Israel to hold off sending troops into the last major population centre they have yet to enter in the four-month war.Key ally the United States has said it will not back any ground operation in Rafah without a ""credible plan"" for protecting civilians.
Rafah is the main entry point for desperately needed relief supplies and UN agencies have warned of a humanitarian disaster if an assault goes ahead.
UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said any military operation ""could lead to a slaughter"".
Terrified civilians have been locked in a desperate search for safety.
""My three children were injured, where can I go?"" Dana Abu Chaaban asked at the city's border crossing with Egypt, where she was hoping to be allowed across with her bandaged-up sons. 
 
- 'Let us cross' -
 Pressure has grown on Egypt to open its border to Palestinian civilians, hundreds of thousands of whom have sought shelter in makeshift camps by the border where they face outbreaks of hepatitis and diarrhoea and a scarcity of food and water.
But it remains closed to Gazans.
""For 100 days we enter the crossing and beg them to let us cross, or to do anything to help us,"" Habiba Nakhala said.
US President Joe Biden has said civilians in Rafah ""need to be protected"", calling them ""exposed and vulnerable"".
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said ""complete victory"" cannot be achieved without the elimination of Hamas's last battalions in Rafah.As the truce talks go on in Cairo, the Israeli military has kept up its bombardment of Gaza. The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said Wednesday that 104 people had been killed overnight.
Late Tuesday, the military released a video it said was from a security camera and showed Gaza's Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar and family members escaping through a tunnel days after the October 7 attack that launched the war.
""The hunt will not stop until he is captured alive or dead,"" Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters.Some Gazans in Rafah were already packing up their belongings in readiness to move but others vowed to stay put, fearing even greater misery in the bombed out hometowns they fled.
Ahlam Abu Assi said she ""would rather die"" in Rafah than return to the famine-like conditions facing relatives who stayed in Gaza City.
""My son and his children have nothing to eat. They cook a handful of rice and save it for the next day,"" she told AFP. ""My grandson cries from hunger.""
 
- Hostages -
 
The Hamas attack that launched the war resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.
At least 28,473 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's response, according to the health ministry.
Around 130 of an estimated 250 people taken hostage by Palestinian militants during the attack are believed to remain in Gaza. Israel says 29 of them are presumed dead.Asked by reporters whether he believes the Americans among the hostages were still alive, National Security Council spokesperson Kirby said: ""We don't have any information to the contrary.""

"War rages in Gaza, dimming Christmas lights in Bethlehem","GAZA - Israel on Sunday pressed on with its war on Hamas in Gaza, shifting focus to the besieged territory's south as a spiralling death toll has thrown a pall of gloom over Bethlehem on Christmas Eve.
US President Joe Biden stressed the ""critical need"" to protect civilians, in a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed Israel would ""continue the war until all of its goals have been achieved"", according to official statements.
As heavy fighting raged on, the Israeli army said it had struck another 200 targets in the past 24 hours in the narrow Palestinian territory, where it is seeking to defeat Hamas and free hostages.The army said 153 troops had died in Gaza since it launched its ground invasion on October 27. Ten soldiers were killed in battles on Saturday, one of the deadliest days for the Israeli side.
""This is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza,"" said Netanyahu on Sunday. ""The war is exacting a very heavy price... but we have no choice but to keep fighting.""
The army said soldiers had raided a northern Gaza compound near schools, a mosque and a clinic and found ""explosive belts adapted for children, dozens of mortar shells, hundreds of grenades and intelligence documents"".
Hamas rejected the Israeli claims, saying they are meant ""to justify their massacring of innocent civilians and their destructive aggression"".
The bloodiest ever Gaza war broke out when Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7 and its Islamist militants killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.Israel's withering military campaign, including massive aerial bombardment, has killed 20,424 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
Vast areas of Gaza lie in ruins and its 2.4 million people have endured dire shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine due to an Israeli siege, alleviated only by the limited arrival of aid trucks.Eighty percent of Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN, many fleeing south and now shielding against the winter cold in makeshift tents.
Near the far southern Gaza city of Rafah, Umm Amir Abu al-Awf, 27, suffered wounds to her hand and legs in a strike on her house early Sunday.
""Who won?"" she said. ""Nothing has been achieved except killing civilians... They keep saying Rafah is safe. It is not safe. Nowhere is safe. Every house has a martyr and injured.""
 
- 'More hatred, less peace' -
 
Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus indicated that forces were close to gaining control in northern Gaza and that now ""we focus our efforts against Hamas in southern Gaza"".Fighting has raged in the main southern city of Khan Yunis, the birthplace of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's leader in Gaza and the man Israel holds most responsible for the October 7 attack.
Elsewhere, Palestinian rescuers scrambled again to pull survivors and bodies from the rubble of a destroyed residential building, after a strike hit in the central city of Deir al-Balah.
""I was praying when a huge explosion occurred,"" said Yazan Moqbel, a wounded man whose sister was still under the broken concrete. ""Rubble fell on us. I didn't know what happened.""
The head of the UN refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, urged an end to the suffering in the third month of the war.""For aid to reach people in need, hostages to be released, more displacement to be avoided and above all stop the appalling loss of lives, a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is the only way forward,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
""War defies logic and humanity, and prepares a future of more hatred and less peace.""
And World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus similarly renewed calls for a ceasefire, saying: ""The decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy.""
On Friday, the United States allowed the passage of a UN Security Council resolution that effectively called on Israel to allow ""immediate, safe and unhindered"" deliveries of life-saving aid to Gaza ""at scale"".World powers had wrangled for days over the wording and, at Washington's insistence, toned down some provisions -- including removing a call for a ceasefire.
Separately, a leading member of Islamic Jihad -- which has been fighting alongside Hamas -- said the group's chief Ziad Nakhaleh arrived in Cairo for talks on a truce and hostage exchange, after the Hamas chief visited last week.
 
- Muted holiday -
 
As the war rages on, Christians around the world celebrate Christmas Eve, and festivities are usually held in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem where they believe Jesus was born.
But this year the city is almost deserted, with few worshippers around and no Christmas tree erected, after church leaders decided to forego ""any unnecessarily festive"" celebrations, in solidarity with Gazans.
The Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, arrived Sunday at the Church of the Nativity, clad in the traditional black and white keffiyeh.""Our heart goes to Gaza, to all people in Gaza but a special attention to our Christian community in Gaza who is suffering,"" he said.
""We are here to pray and to ask not only for a ceasefire, a ceasefire is not enough, we have to stop these hostilities and to turn the page because violence generates only violence.""
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas voiced hope Christmas would mark ""a cessation of the Israeli war against the Palestinian people in Gaza, as well as across the occupied Palestinian territories"".
The Gaza war has heightened tensions across the Middle East. Cross-border fire has erupted almost daily between Israel and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement.
And Yemen's Huthi rebels have fired at cargo vessels in the Red Sea, leading the United States to build a naval taskforce to deter the missile and drone strikes.The US military said four drones had targeted the USS Laboon, but had been shot down, and that an Indian-flagged tanker was hit and sent out a distress call.
Iran's deputy foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, denied the Islamic republic was orchestrating the campaign, saying the Huthis act on their ""own decisions and capabilities"".
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, in an interview published Sunday, branded Iran ""a thoroughly malign influence in the region and in the world"".

"Facing Putin threat, EU pushes to arm Ukraine -- and itself","EU leaders grappled at a summit meeting Thursday with how to get more weapons to Ukraine's outgunned forces while also re-arming their own countries in the face of Russia's emboldened President Vladimir Putin.
More than two years into Moscow's war against its neighbour, Kyiv's troops are struggling to hold back the Russian army as Western deliveries of ammunition have faltered.
Putin has tightened his iron grip over his country by winning a new six-year term at elections after opposition was crushed. 
Addressing the EU's 27 leaders via videolink, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told them the shortfall in ammunition facing his troops was ""humiliating"" for Europe.
""Europe can provide more -- and it is crucial to prove it now,"" he said, also calling for additional air-defence systems in the wake of a large-scale strike on Kyiv.
As a $60-billion package remains stalled in Washington, the EU leaders debated a plan to use profits from 200 billion euros in frozen Russian central bank assets on weapons for Ukraine.
The proposal could unlock some three billion euros ($3.3 billion) a year for Kyiv, but leaders were not expected to give the final go-ahead on Thursday.
That would come on top of more than 33 billion euros that the EU says it has provided towards arming Ukraine since the Kremlin invaded in February 2022.
 
- Kremlin threatens retaliation -
Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who had been cautious about undermining EU markets, threw his weight behind the plan as legally sound.
But the Kremlin warned it would use legal and ""other methods of retaliation"" to hit back.Alongside the efforts to get more weapons to Kyiv, the EU is also scrambling for ways to boost Europe's defence industry to be able to arm Ukraine and build up its own forces. 
Brussels has put forward a raft of proposals aimed at ramping up capacity but there are complaints that Europe is still not moving fast enough.
While Russia has put its economy on a war footing, the EU has fallen well short of a promise made last year to supply Ukraine with a million artillery shells by this month.
But the Czech Republic has spearheaded its own initiative aimed at getting hundreds of thousands of shells available around the world to send to Kyiv.
France and Estonia have pitched the idea of using joint borrowing -- similar to the massive package of support the EU came up with during the Covid pandemic -- to fund defence spending. But a majority of member states, led by so-called ""frugal"" countries such as Germany, are unwilling to go anywhere near that far.
""If that doesn't fly, then propose something else, some other solution that we can solve this problem, because there is a big problem of funding the defence industry,"" said Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.
Instead, the discussion was set to focus on getting the EU's lending arm, the European Investment Bank, to expand its funding for the sector.
At the moment, the bank is limited to investing in only a small number of ""dual-use products"" that can have both military and civilian functions.
 
- Call for Gaza truce -
While the response to the conflict in Ukraine dominated the summit, EU leaders were also looking for a united stance on the war in Gaza, with United Nations chief Antonio Guterres in attendance.
Diplomats say an overwhelming majority of countries support a call for an ""immediate humanitarian pause"" in Israel's offensive and a warning for it not to launch a ground operation in Rafah.
But Irish premier Leo Varadkar said staunch Israeli allies the Czech Republic and Austria were reluctant to back that wording, in the latest obstacle to EU unity on the issue. 
""The response to the appalling crisis in Palestine has not been Europe's finest hour, quite frankly,"" he said.
Closer to home, EU leaders look set to give the green light to opening membership talks with Bosnia, as Russia's war has sparked a push to expand the bloc.""It's a two-step approach,"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said.  
""Yes, opening membership talks, but also, yes, working on all the outstanding issues before we can take the next step.""

'Last resort': Donors hope to offer Gaza lifeline with air drops,"GAZA CITY - With the humanitarian situation in Gaza increasingly desperate, the United States said Friday that it would join some of its Arab and European allies in delivering emergency relief from the sky. 
The amount of aid brought into the territory by truck has plummeted during nearly five months of war, and Gazans are facing dire shortages of food, water and medicines. 
A frenzied scramble for food from a truck convoy delivering aid to northern Gaza left more than 100 people dead on Thursday, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, after Israeli forces opened fire on the crowd. 
With most aid convoys halted, some foreign militaries have air-dropped supplies to Gaza instead, sending long lines of aid pallets floating down into the war-torn territory on parachutes. 
Jordan has been conducting many of the operations since war broke out on October 7, with the support of countries including Britain, France and the Netherlands. 
Egypt sent several military planes on an airdrop Thursday together with the United Arab Emirates. Imad Dughmosh from Al-Sabra in central Gaza told AFP he managed to get some food and water from the aid drops, but there hadn't been enough for everyone waiting.
""In the end, I took bags of pasta and cheese, but my cousins were not able to get anything,"" the 44-year-old said. 
""I was happy because I took some food for the children, but it was not enough.""
- Humanitarian crisis -
Deliveries into Gaza have been reduced to a trickle since the war began on October 7 with an unprecedented Hamas attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, Israeli figures show. Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed 30,228 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.
In northern Gaza, where Israel began its ground operation, many residents have been reduced to eating animal fodder.
Ten children have died of ""malnutrition and dehydration"", the health ministry said Friday. 
As well as the risks of dropping parcels onto crowded camps and cities, residents of the coastal territory told AFP many aid pallets had ended up in the Mediterranean. 
""Most of the aid fell into the sea today, and also the parachutes that fell on Thursday and Wednesday all fell into the sea, except for a very small number,"" said Hani Ghabboun, who lives in Gaza City with his wife and five children.
He said Gazans need ""hundreds of tonnes of aid to confront the famine and feed the people.""
- 'Extremely challenging' -
Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian office OCHA, said Friday that there were ""many issues"" with airdrops, which are better for small, specific missions.""Aid that comes in in that way is a last resort,"" he said, adding that it was ""not the solution that we prefer"" for Gaza.
""Overland transfer is simply better, more efficient, more effective and less costly.""
But he warned: ""If something doesn't change, a famine is almost inevitable on the current trends.""
The United Nations has accused Israeli forces of ""systematically"" blocking access to Gaza, which Israel denies. 
But Biden said on Friday that he would ""insist"" Israel let in more convoys by land. ""No excuses, because the truth is aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere near enough."" 
He also said the United States would study a possible ""marine corridor"" to deliver large amounts of supplies into Gaza.
Aid groups, including the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, say safe road convoys are the best solution for the scale of need in Gaza.
A spokesman for the UN chief Antonio Guterres told reporters that nearly 1,000 trucks are waiting at the Egyptian border and ready to move.
""Air drops are extremely challenging,"" Stephane Dujarric said at a briefing this week. ""(But) all options remain on the table"".Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International, said air drops can only ""help on the margins"".
One plane can deliver the equivalent of two truckloads of aid, but at 10 times the cost, he told the BBC World Service on Friday.
""Rather than dropping food from the air, we should be putting immense pressure and using leverage on the Israeli government to allow aid in through more traditional channels that actually deliver at scale.""

Israel says two hostages rescued in Rafah operation,"RAFAH - Israel announced on Monday the rescue of two hostages in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where the Hamas-run health ministry said ""around 100"" Palestinians including children were killed in heavy overnight air strikes.
Israel is preparing for a ground incursion into the teeming city along the border with Egypt, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from fighting further north.
The precarious humanitarian situation in Rafah has prompted aid groups and foreign governments, including Israel's key ally the United States, to express deep concern over the potentially disastrous consequences of expanding operations there.
The Israeli military announced early Monday morning that two hostages had been rescued in a joint military, Shin Bet and police operation in Rafah after nearly 130 days in captivity.
In a statement, the army identified the two as Fernando Simon Marman and Louis Har, saying they ""were kidnapped by the Hamas terrorist organization on October 7th from Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak"". Both were in ""good medical condition"", it added.
""The military and the Shin Bet have been working on this operation for a long time... and they waited until the conditions were right to carry it out,"" army spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a briefing.
A firefight broke out as the hostages were being taken out of the building they were held in, he added, with air strikes targeting nearby buildings where shots were fired. 
""Many terrorists were killed this evening during this operation and one of our fighters was slightly injured,"" he said.",Monday 12 February 2024 - 09:30am
Biden says Israeli occupation of Gaza would be 'big mistake'," 
WASHINGTON - Any move by Israel to occupy the Gaza Strip again would be a ""big mistake,"" US President Joe Biden said in an interview released on Sunday, as Israeli troops prepared for a ground invasion.
Israel, seeking vengeance for an attack by Hamas on October 7, has declared war on the militant group, launching a relentless bombing campaign and warning more than a million people in northern Gaza to move south ahead of the operation.
Asked by CBS news program 60 Minutes if he would support any occupation of Gaza by the American ally, Biden replied: ""I think it'd be a big mistake.""
Hamas ""don't represent all the Palestinian people,"" he continued.
But invading and ""taking out the extremists"" is a ""necessary requirement,"" he added.
The Hamas attack saw fighters shoot, stab and burn to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. Israel's reprisal attacks in the days since have flattened neighbourhoods and killed at least 2,670 people in Gaza, the majority ordinary Palestinians.
Israel has faced grave warnings about the implications of putting boots on the ground in Gaza, with aid groups warning of a humanitarian disaster, fears of the conflict escalating, and the challenges of separating militants from civilians in the impoverished, densely occupied territory.
Israel first occupied Gaza during the 1967 Six-Day War, and it was only fully returned to Palestinians in 2005.
A year later, Israel imposed an air, land and sea blockade on the 140 square mile (362 square kilometer) strip of land, which is also bordered by Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.
In 2007 Israel tightened the blockade after Hamas took control of Gaza from the secular Fatah movement of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
When asked if Hamas -- whom Biden described as ""a bunch of cowards"" -- must be eliminated entirely, he replied: ""Yes I do.""
""But there needs to be a Palestinian authority. There needs to be a path to a Palestinian state,"" he continued, reiterating the long-standing US call for a two-state solution.
60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley also asked Biden if he could foresee US troops joining the war.
""I don't think that's necessary,"" Biden, who pulled US troops out of Afghanistan and has insisted that none will be sent to aid Ukraine as it holds off a Russian invasion, replied.
""Israel has one of the finest fighting forces in the country. I guarantee we're gonna provide them everything they need,"" he said. 
The United States has already deployed two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean in a powerful show of support for Israel.

"UN chief, at Gaza crossing, urges end to 'nightmare' of war","JERUSALEM - UN chief Antonio Guterres, on a visit to the doorstep of Gaza Saturday, appealed for a ceasefire to allow in more aid, saying the world has ""seen enough"" horrors in the Israel-Hamas war.
As Israeli forces pressed on with a multi-day raid on the territory's biggest hospital, Hamas officials reported 19 deaths at an aid distribution point on the outskirts of Gaza City.
Gaza's Hamas authorities said at least 19 people were killed and dozens wounded by Israeli ""tank fire and shells"" as they were waiting for desperately needed supplies.
The Israeli army denied it had fired on the crowd. ""Preliminary findings have determined that there was no aerial strike against the convoy, nor were there incidents found of (Israeli) forces firing at the people at the aid convoy,"" it said.
In a similar scene earlier this month, the health ministry said Israeli fire had killed 20 people seeking aid in the same location, but the military accused ""armed Palestinians"" of opening fire on the crowd.
Nearly six months of fighting, triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, have led to dire humanitarian conditions in the besieged territory.""Palestinians in Gaza -- children, women, men -- remain stuck in a non-stop nightmare,"" Guterres said at the Egyptian side of Rafah border crossing with Gaza, the main entry point for aid.
Most of the territory's 2.4 million people have sought refuge on the Gaza side of Rafah, where Israel has vowed to send in ground troops in its war against Hamas.
""I carry the voices of the vast majority of the world who have seen enough,"" Guterres said, deploring ""communities obliterated, homes demolished, entire families and generations wiped out"".
 
- Hospital raid -
 
He said ""nothing justifies"" the October 7 attack or the ""collective punishment"" of Palestinians, and asked Israel to commit to ""total, unfettered access for humanitarian goods throughout Gaza"".
""A long line of blocked relief trucks on one side of the gates -- the long shadow of starvation on the other"" were ""a moral outrage"", Guterres said.On the sixth day of Israel's operation in and around Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital complex, the army's Southern Command chief Major General Yaron Finkelman vowed to keep on until ""the last terrorist is in our hands, alive or dead"".
Gaza City resident Mohammed, 59, who lives a short walk from Al-Shifa, told AFP he had seen ""many bodies"" in the streets, buildings on fire and tanks blocking the roads.
""I feel that Gaza has become worse than the fires of hell,"" he said, giving only his first name.
The army has said more than 170 militants have been killed in and around the hospital, which was already raided by Israeli troops in November.The army said the current operation avoided harm to civilians or medical personnel, but the UN humanitarian office OCHA said ""health workers have been among those reported arrested and detained"".
The Israeli government is under growing international pressure to ease its bombardment and ground offensive, which the Gaza health ministry says have killed at least 32,142 people, most of them women and children.
The unprecedented Hamas attack on October resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
Israel has vowed to destroy the militants, who also seized about 250 hostages, of whom Israel believes around 130 remain in Gaza, including 33 presumed dead.
Efforts by Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators to broker a ceasefire involving the exchange of some of the remaining hostages for Palestinians held in Israeli jails have made no headway.
Deep gaps remain between the warring parties, a Hamas official with knowledge of the talks told AFP on Saturday.
""There is a deep divergence in positions in the negotiations between Hamas and the occupation because the enemy understood the flexibility shown by the movement as weakness,"" the official said.
 
- 'Nothing to eat' -
 
Despite warnings that a Rafah operation would cause mass civilian casualties, Israeli officials said the military would press ahead with a threatened assault on the city, arguing it was necessary to eliminate Hamas.""If we need to, we will do it alone"", without US support, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after a Friday meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was on a regional tour to push for a truce.
Large parts of the territory have been reduced to rubble and the World Food Programme has said Gazans were already ""starving to death"", with famine projected by May in northern Gaza without urgent intervention.
In Gaza City, in the north, Belal Hzilah said his nephew was among those killed at the aid distribution point as he was waiting to collect food for his two-month-old baby and other relatives.
""They have nothing to eat,"" Hzilah told AFP. ""He went to the Kuwait roundabout to get flour and food... He lost his life for nothing.""Defence Minister Yoav Gallant is to head to Washington Sunday to discuss the latest developments with his counterpart Lloyd Austin and other senior officials.

Hamas says Israeli strikes killed hostages,"GAZA - Hamas said on Thursday Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed almost 50 of the hostages its militants seized in bloody cross-border attacks as the United Nations warned ""nowhere is safe"" in the territory.
The group's armed wing made the claim, which AFP could not immediately verify, after Israel sent tanks, troops and armoured bulldozers into the enclave in a ""targeted raid"" overnight that the military said destroyed multiple sites before withdrawing.
""(Ezzedine) Al-Qassam Brigades estimates that the number of Zionist prisoners who were killed in the Gaza Strip as a result of Zionist strikes and massacres has reached almost 50,"" the group said in a statement on its Telegram channel. 
Hamas's shock October 7 attacks, the worst in Israeli history, saw throngs of Hamas gunmen pour from Gaza into Israel, killing more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping 224 more, according to official tallies.
Israel has retaliated with relentless strikes that Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said have killed more than 7,000 people, also mainly civilians -- a toll expected to rise substantially if Israeli troops massed near the border thrust across.
On the 20th day of Israel's bloodiest Gaza war yet, the UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Lynne Hastings, said that despite the Israeli military issuing warnings to people in Gaza City to leave, ""advance warnings make no difference"".
She said in a statement that when evacuation routes are bombed, ""people are left with nothing but impossible choices. Nowhere is safe in Gaza.""
The army said overnight its forces hit ""numerous terrorist cells, infrastructure and anti-tank missile launch posts"".Black smoke billowed into the sky after a blast in the grainy night-vision footage the Israeli military released hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared preparations for a ground war were under way. 
The operation in northern Gaza came in ""preparation for the next stages of combat"", the military said.
The black-and-white video showed armoured vehicles moving near Gaza's border fence. Other footage appeared to show an air strike and buildings being targeted.
The raid came after Netanyahu delivered a nationally televised address to Israelis still grieving and furious after the October 7 attacks, telling them ""we are in the midst of a campaign for our existence"".
International alarm has increased amid growing shock about the scale of human suffering inside the besieged Palestinian territory where Israel has cut off most water, food, fuel and other basic supplies.In southern Gaza, a grieving Umm Omar al-Khaldi told AFP how she saw her neighbours being killed in an Israeli strike that reduced the house to rubble, with many feared buried beneath.
""We saw them getting bombarded -- the children got bombarded while their mother was hugging them,"" the woman said, desperately pleading for help from the outside world.
""Where are the Arabs, where is humanity?"" she asked.
Amnesty International in a statement called for an immediate ceasefire to ensure ""access to life-saving aid for people in Gaza amidst an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe"".
The human rights group's chief Agnes Callamard said: ""Serious violations of international humanitarian law, including war crimes, by all parties to the conflict continue unabated.""
 
- Surging death toll -
 
The war's surging death toll is by far the highest since Israel unilaterally withdrew from the small coastal territory in 2005 -- a period that has seen four previous Gaza wars.Entire neighbourhoods have been razed, surgeons are operating without anaesthetic, and ice-cream trucks have become makeshift morgues.
In chaotic scenes, volunteers and neighbours have clawed, sometimes with their bare hands, through shattered concrete and sand to pull out civilian casualties.
All too often they recover only corpses which have piled up, wrapped in bloodstained white shrouds.
In Brussels on Thursday, European Union leaders debated calling for ""pauses"" in the war so aid can get in.
The 27-nation bloc has long been split between more pro-Palestinian members such as Ireland and Spain, and staunch backers of Israel including Germany and Austria.
""What we want is the killing and the violence to stop so that humanitarian aid can get into Gaza, where innocent Palestinian people are suffering, and also to allow us to get EU citizens out,"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said.
US President Joe Biden, a strong supporter of Israel, earlier joined the calls for it to ""protect innocent civilians"" and to follow the ""laws of war"" as it pursues Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron warned Wednesday that ""a massive intervention that would put civilian lives at risk would be an error"".
And Jordan's King Abdullah II said anger at the suffering could ""lead to an explosion"" in the Middle East.
 
- 'Raining down hellfire' -
 
Netanyahu -- amid the growing calls to temper the ferocious bombing campaign -- said Israel had been ""raining down hellfire on Hamas"" and killing ""thousands of terrorists"".He said his war cabinet and the military would determine the timing of a ""ground offensive"" with the goal to ""eliminate Hamas"" and ""bring our captives home"".
But he stressed that ""I will not detail when, how or how many"" forces would take part.
Netanyahu also acknowledged for the first time that he would have to explain the security lapses exposed on October 7.
""The fault will be examined and everyone will have to give answers, including me,"" he said. ""But all this will happen later.""Biden stressed that ""when this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next"".
He reiterated that Washington supports a two-state solution with independent Israeli and Palestinian states.
""It means a concentrated effort for all the parties -- Israelis, Palestinians, regional partners, global leaders -- to put us on a path toward peace,"" Biden said.
The war has sparked fears of a regional conflagration if it draws in more of Israel's enemies such as Iran-backed Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon.There has also been a rise in attacks on Israel's top ally, which has military bases across the Middle East.
About 2,500 American troops are stationed in Iraq and some 900 in Syria to help fight remnants of the Islamic State jihadist group.
The Pentagon said there were 10 attacks on US and allied forces in Iraq and three in Syria between October 17 and 24, involving a ""mix of one-way attack drones and rockets"".

No functional hospitals left in northern Gaza: WHO,"There are no longer any functional hospitals in the north of the Gaza Strip, the World Health Organization said Thursday, describing ""unbearable"" scenes of largely abandoned patients begging for food and water.
The UN health agency said it had led missions to two badly damaged hospitals, Al-Shifa and Al-Ahli, in the north of the Palestinian territory on Wednesday.
""Our staff are running out of words to describe the beyond catastrophic situation facing remaining patients and health workers,"" said Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for the occupied Palestinian territory.
His comment came amid increasingly frantic diplomatic efforts to secure a pause in the war that Hamas says has already claimed 20,000 lives in Gaza, 70 percent of them women and children.
The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
WHO has already described Al-Shifa, the largest hospital in Gaza which last month was the focus of an extended Israeli army operation and has been devastated by Israeli bombardments, as ""a blood bath"". 
The smaller Al-Ahli hospital had since become the only place where surgeries were possible in the north, but its director said it had stopped operating on Tuesday after being stormed by the Israeli army.
 
- Dying 'slowly and painfully' -
 
The WHO-led mission revealed that Al Ahli, which just two days ago was ""overwhelmed with patients needing emergency care"", was now ""a shell of a hospital"", Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva via video link from Jerusalem.
""There are no operating theatres anymore due to the lack of fuel, power, medical supplies and health workers, including surgeons and other specialists,"" he added.
""It has completely stopped functioning.""
Of Gaza's original 36 hospitals, only nine are now partially functional, all of them in the south.
""There are no functional hospitals left in the north.""
Hospitals, protected under international humanitarian law, have repeatedly been hit by Israeli strikes in Gaza since the war erupted.
The Israeli military accuses Hamas of having tunnels under hospitals and using the medical facilities as command centres, a charge denied by the Islamist group.
Asked about the charge, Peeperkorn said ""we on our missions have not seen anything of this on the ground"", adding that WHO was ""not in a position to assert how any hospital is being used"".
Although Wednesday's mission had aimed to deliver fuel, he said, the lack of security guarantees had meant they could only deliver medical supplies and medicines.
But that was not enough, he said.
""Without fuel, staff, and other essential needs, medicines won't make a difference and all patients will die slowly and painfully.""
Al Ahli, he said, still counts around 10 staff striving to provide basic first aid, while around 80 patients are sheltering in a church within the hospital grounds and the orthopaedic section.
 
- 'Too late' -
 
Sean Casey, a WHO Emergency Medical Teams coordinator who was on the mission, described ""unbelievable conditions"".
At Al Ahli, the team had walked through the courtyard, where bodies wrapped in white plastic sheeting piled up, and with automatic gunfire sounding nearby, he told journalists, speaking from Rafah in southern Gaza.
In the church, ""we found a really unbearable scene,"" Casey said, describing around 30 patients, including young children and some with serious trauma wounds begging, not for care but for water.
""At the moment, it is a place where people are waiting to die.""
He reiterated the increasingly urgent call for a ceasefire to allow sufficient amounts of aid in and also to evacuate more patients from Gaza.""We are dealing with starving adults, children... Everywhere we go, people are asking us for food,"" he said.
""Even in the hospitals, ... people with open, bleeding fractures, they ask for food.
""If that is not an indicator of the desperation, I don't know what is."" ",Thursday 21 December 2023 - 15:22pm
Tens of thousands flee as Israel tightens Gaza City 'stranglehold',"JERUSALEM - Tens of thousands of Palestinians fled the fighting and bombardment in Gaza, as Israel said it was tightening the ""stranglehold"" around Hamas and again rejected a ceasefire without the release of hostages.
Calls for a ceasefire to protect civilians have built over a month into the war sparked when Hamas attacked Israel and, according to Israeli officials, killed about 1,400 people, mainly civilians, and seized 239 hostages.
Aiming to destroy Hamas, Israel retaliated with a relentless bombardment and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip that, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, has killed more than 10,500 people, many of them children.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rejected the prospect of a ceasefire in Gaza, amid reports of negotiations for a temporary truce with Hamas to allow in humanitarian aid. 
The Israeli army said 50,000 people left north Gaza for the south of the narrow coastal strip on Wednesday as the fighting raged between Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, and Israeli troops.
""We saw today how 50,000 Gazans moved from northern Gaza to southern Gaza,"" said military spokesman Daniel Hagari. ""They're leaving because they understand that Hamas lost control in the north, and in the south it's safer.""
Around 15,000 people had fled on Tuesday, compared with 5,000 on Monday and 2,000 on Sunday, said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).""The collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians amounts also to a war crime, as does the unlawful forcible evacuation of civilians,"" he told a news conference.
""The aid getting through is a trickle,"" Turk said, adding it was Israel's obligation to ""ensure a maximum of basic necessities of life that can reach all who need it.""
A Hamas official told AFP that evacuations of wounded Palestinians and dual nationals were interrupted Wednesday despite a large crowd waiting at the crossing terminal, blaming what they said was Israel's refusal to approve the list of wounded to be taken across the border.
 
- 'Where can we go?' -
 
A source close to Hamas had said talks were underway for the release of a dozen hostages held by the Islamists, including six Americans, in return for a three-day ceasefire in Gaza.Earlier a separate source briefed on the talks said Qatar was mediating negotiations in coordination with the US to free ""10-15 hostages in exchange for a one- to two-day ceasefire"".
As the talks proceeded, the pace of Palestinian civilians fleeing south from northern Gaza accelerated in the face of Israel's intensifying air and ground campaign, according to UN observers.
""We've lost our homes, we've lost our children. Where is the global community? Where are our fellow Muslims? Look at us!"" said Nouh Hammouda, who was among those fleeing.
""We left our homes due to the relentless bombardment. Where can we go now?"" he said as people streamed southward on the road.Israel has set an aim of destroying Hamas and said its ground forces were advancing in pursuit of the militants who have a deep network of tunnels and underground bases.
""(Israeli troops) are tightening the stranglehold around the city of Gaza,"" Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said.
Israel has air-dropped leaflets and sent texts ordering civilians in northern Gaza to flee south, but potentially hundreds of thousands remained in the worst-hit areas.
Images taken by an AFP journalist embedded with Israeli troops showed them emerging from tanks to comb the shells of Gaza residential buildings destroyed in the fighting.
Hamas accused the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) of ""colluding"" with Israel in the ""forced displacement"" of Gazans, after residents followed instructions to flee.
An UNRWA spokeswoman did not immediately respond when contacted by AFP about the Hamas accusation.
 
- Fierce streets battles -
 
G7 foreign ministers said they supported ""humanitarian pauses and corridors"" in the Israel-Hamas war, but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.As fighting intensifies in Gaza, families of people taken hostage by Hamas have been pushing on various fronts for help to bring their loved ones home.
""Every day is like eternity to me and I can't wait any longer,"" Doris Liber, whose 26-year-old son Guy Iluz was shot and taken hostage at a music festival, told reporters in Washington.
Military analysts warned of weeks of gruelling house-to-house fighting ahead in Gaza. 
The operation is hugely complicated for Israel because of the hostages, including very young children and frail elderly people, who are believed to be held inside a vast tunnel network.
The Israeli army said it had uncovered around 130 tunnel entrances in Gaza. It also reported the deaths of two more soldiers, bringing to 33 the total number killed in the offensive.
Hamas released video footage of fierce street battles between its armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, and Israeli forces in the northern and southern axis of Gaza City.
In densely packed Gaza -- where more than 1.5 million people have fled their homes in a desperate search for safety -- the suffering is immense.Hamas said several cemeteries in Gaza had ""no more space for burials"", while the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said most of the territory's sewage pumping stations were shut.
A rare delivery of emergency medical supplies and medicines on Wednesday reached Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the UN and World Health Organization said.
But they highlighted the delivery of life-saving supplies was only the second to reach the hospital since the war erupted and was ""far from sufficient to respond to the immense needs"".
Tom Potokar, chief surgeon at the International Committee of the Red Cross who entered Gaza on October 27, described the scene at the European hospital in Khan Yunis as ""relentless"" and ""catastrophic"". 
""In the last 24 hours, I've seen three patients with maggots in their wounds,"" including a six-year-old child, he said in a telephone interview.
""It's almost like you can't find somebody who hasn't lost members of their family"" from among the patients and staff, he said, adding there were ""cases where you see a child come in where they have nobody, they've lost their whole family.""
 
- 'Premature' for Gaza scenarios -
 
Israel accuses Hamas of building military tunnels underneath hospitals, schools and mosques -- charges the militant group denies.
Israel has hammered Gaza with more than 12,000 air and artillery strikes and sent in ground forces that have effectively cut it in half.An independent UN expert branded Israel's systematic bombardment of housing and civilian infrastructure in Gaza as well as Hamas's rocket attacks that hit Israeli dwellings as war crimes.
The Israeli government said Wednesday it was ""premature"" to predict scenarios for Gaza after it ousts Hamas, but that it was already discussing the prospect with other countries.
Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and two years later imposed a crippling air, sea and land blockade, as Hamas took control of the Palestinian territory.
""We're exploring several contingencies together with our international partners for what the 'day after' will look like,"" said government spokesman Eylon Levy.
But the ""common denominator"" is that Gaza will be ""demilitarised"" and ""must never again"" become a ""terror nest"", he said.
Netanyahu had said earlier this week that Israel would assume ""overall security"" of Gaza.
Violence is also increasing in the West Bank, Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967, where more than 150 Palestinians have been killed by fire from Israeli soldiers or settlers since October 7, according to the Palestinian Authority.
Israeli air strikes on Wednesday killed three pro-Iran fighters as they hit sites belonging to the powerful Lebanese Hezbollah group near the Syrian capital Damascus, a war monitor said.
Israel has struck Syria several times in the past month as regional tensions simmer.

Israel battles Hamas in Gaza City," 
 
JERUSALEM - Israel's campaign to crush Hamas ground into its second month Wednesday as its forces battled the Palestinian militants in Gaza City, despite mounting calls for a ceasefire.
Underlining Israel's determination to destroy Hamas, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant described Gaza as ""the largest terrorist base ever built.""
""We are in the heart of Gaza City,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.
Israel launched a massive campaign in the Gaza Strip after Hamas militants staged an unprecedented attack on October 7 that killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, Israel's relentless bombardment has killed more than 10,300 people, many of them children.
Calls for a halt in the fighting have gone unheard, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting there would be no pause until the more than 240 hostages seized by Hamas are freed. 
United Nations rights chief Volker Turk said the past month was one marked by ""carnage, of incessant suffering, bloodshed, destruction, outrage and despair"".
 
- 'Death and suffering' -
 In Jerusalem on Tuesday night, sobs pierced memorial ceremonies and crowds lit candles while mourning the 1,400 dead, including families slain in their homes and young people killed at a music festival in the worst attack in Israel's history.
""There's not one person not impacted by these horrible attacks,"" said 52-year-old Sharon Balaban, one of thousands of Israelis attending the vigils. 
""Everyone knows somebody who was hurt, killed, murdered or impacted.""
In densely packed Gaza -- where more than 1.5 million people have fled their homes in a desperate search for safety -- the suffering is immense.
Entire city blocks have been levelled and bodies in white shrouds are piling up outside hospitals, where surgeons operate on bloodied floors by the light of phones.
The World Health Organization said an average of 160 children are killed every day in Gaza by the war.
""The level of death and suffering is hard to fathom,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said.Hamas's media office said on Telegram that several cemeteries in Gaza had ""no more space for burials"", while the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)said most of the territory's sewage pumping stations were shut.
Israel accuses Hamas of building military tunnels underneath hospitals, schools and mosques  -- charges the militant group denies. 
OCHA says Israel has ordered all 13 hospitals still operational in northern Gaza to evacuate patients.
Netanyahu has said no fuel will be delivered to besieged Gaza, but may allow possible ""tactical pauses"" to free hostages and deliver aid.
 
- G7 meeting -
 But Israel appeared to row back on Netanyahu's comments his country would assume ""overall security"" in Gaza after the war ends, after Washington said it opposed a long-term occupation of Gaza.
""Our viewpoint is that Palestinians must be at the forefront of these decisions and Gaza is Palestinian land and it will remain Palestinian land,"" US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said.
""Generally speaking, we do not support the reoccupation of Gaza and neither does Israel.""
Ron Dermer, Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs and part of Netanyahu's war cabinet, told the BBC that Israeli forces would not reoccupy Gaza, but carry out security operations against anything they saw as a threat.
Israel withdrew its troops from the territory, which it captured in the 1967 Six-Day War, in 2005.In the occupied West Bank on Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested the Palestinian Authority under president Mahmud Abbas should retake control.
The PA exercises limited autonomy in only parts of the West Bank, and Abbas said it could only potentially return to power in Gaza if a ""comprehensive political solution"" is found for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad dismissed the suggestion, saying the militants were ""part of the national Palestinian fabric"", he told Al-Jazeera Arabic.""After failing in Iraq and Afghanistan... now the Americans are dreaming that they can rearrange Gaza in the way that they see fit"", he said. 
Blinken, following a Middle East tour of crisis diplomacy, is in Japan for a meeting of G7 foreign ministers to seek a common line on Gaza.
The ministers are expected to call in a joint statement for ""humanitarian pauses"" in Gaza, while stopping short of urging a ceasefire -- in line with US policy on the war.
""All over Gaza, helpless people are losing their family members, homes, and their own lives, while world leaders fail to take meaningful action,"" medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said.
In its statement, MSF detailed how a staff member was killed on Monday along with his family in Gaza's Shati refugee camp when the area was bombed.
 
-  'We don't want war' -
 Israel has hammered Gaza with more than 12,000 air and artillery strikes and sent in ground forces that have effectively cut it in half.
It has air-dropped leaflets and sent texts ordering civilians in northern Gaza to flee south, but a US official said Saturday at least 350,000 civilians remained in the worst-hit areas.
Clutching one of her toddlers, Amira al-Sakani said she fled Gaza City after coming across the air-dropped Israeli flyers.
On the way, Sakani said she saw ""bodies of martyrs, some in pieces"" as people fled the worst of the fighting. 
""Our life is tragic; we don't want war... we want peace"", she added.
The International Committee of the Red Cross, which said one of its humanitarian convoys in Gaza was hit by gunfire on Tuesday, demanded an end to the suffering of civilians.
""Children have been ripped from their families and held hostage. In Gaza, ICRC surgeons treat toddlers whose skin is charred from widespread burns,"" the organisation's president Mirjana Spoljaric said.
Military analysts warned of weeks of gruelling house-to-house fighting ahead in Gaza, with around 30 Israeli soldiers already killed in the offensive.In a televised statement, Netanyahu issued a stark warning to Hezbollah in Lebanon which, like Hamas, is backed by Iran.
""If Hezbollah makes the choice of joining the war it will be making the mistake of its life,"" he said.

Hamas open to truce extension as expiry nears,"TEL AVIV - A truce between Israel and Hamas entered its final hours on Friday as more hostages were freed from Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
The militant group said it was willing to extend the truce further, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for the pause to continue.
But there was no sign early on Friday morning of whether the two sides would reach terms to extend the halt in fighting for an eighth day, and Blinken also used a visit to Israel to urge that any resumption of military operations protect Palestinian civilians.
The truce, due to expire early on Friday local time, has paused fighting that began on October 7 when Hamas militants broke through Gaza's militarised border into Israel.
The surprise attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants kidnapped about 240, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response and unleashed an air and ground military campaign in Gaza that the Hamas government says has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians.Since the start of a truce brokered by Qatar, 80 Israeli hostages have been freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
More than 20 foreigners, most of them Thais living in Israel, have been freed outside the scope of the agreement.
Overnight, six more Israelis, some holding dual nationality, were freed, hours after two women were released.
That brought the total freed Thursday to eight, less than the 10 hostages a day the truce deal requires Hamas to release. A source close to the militant group said it was counting two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday in the seventh batch.
The release brought relief for Keren Shem, whose daughter Mia was among those freed. The family released footage showing Keren weeping with joy as she was informed by phone of her daughter's imminent freedom.
""Mia is coming back,"" she cried out.
 
- 'We want an eighth day' -
 
Not long after the hostages arrived in Israel, the country's prison service said another 30 Palestinian prisoners -- 23 minors and seven women -- had been freed. 
After meeting leaders in Israel and the occupied West Bank, Blinken said Washington wants ""to see this process continue to move forward.""
""We want an eighth day and beyond.""
A source close to Hamas said the group backed another extension and that ""mediators are currently making strong, intense and continuous efforts for an additional day in the truce and then working to extend it again for other days.""Israel has made clear it sees the truce as a temporary pause to secure the release of hostages, and that it plans to resume fighting.
""We swore... to eliminate Hamas, and nothing will stop us,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video released by his office, after meeting with Blinken.
But his government has come under increasing pressure to account for how it will protect civilians in the territory, which is under blockade, with no way for people to escape.
Blinken warned that any resumed military operation by Israel ""must put in place humanitarian civilian protection plans that minimise further casualties of innocent Palestinians"".
Specifically, Israel must ""clearly and precisely"" designate areas ""in southern and central Gaza, where they can be safe and out of the line of fire"", he said.
International bodies have called for more time to get medical supplies, food and fuel into Gaza, where an estimated 1.7 million people have been forced from their homes.The truce has allowed people to return to the ruins of their homes to pick through the rubble for remaining belongings, but also provided a sense of safety after weeks of daily bombardment.
""We are afraid that the truce will end, so the problems and the bombings will start again,"" Gaza City resident Mohamad Naasan told AFP on Thursday.
""I hope that the truce resumes... so peace prevails, and we all go back home.""
 
- Report: Israel had intelligence on attack -
 
The pause in fighting has not tempered violence elsewhere though.
On Thursday morning, two gunman opened fire at a bus stop in Jerusalem, killing three people in an attack claimed by Hamas.
The gunmen, who police said were from annexed east Jerusalem, were shot dead at the scene.
Separately, two Israeli soldiers were lightly injured in a ramming attack on a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, the army said, adding the assailant had also been ""shot and neutralised"".
The violence in Gaza has also raised tensions in the West Bank, where nearly 240 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers since October 7, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry.The New York Times reported overnight that Israeli authorities were aware Hamas was planning a major assault, and had obtained a blueprint for the attack, which the group appears to have largely followed on October 7.
The newspaper said the plan called for a barrage of rockets, followed by efforts to knock out surveillance, and then a wave of militants to pour into Israel -- all elements of the October 7 attack.
Intelligence and military officials however dismissed the plan as aspirational, even after a signals analyst warned the group had carried out a training exercise in line with the plan, according to the report.

Israel pounds Gaza after US blocks UN ceasefire,"Israel bombarded targets in Gaza on Saturday after the United States blocked an extraordinary United Nations bid for a ceasefire in the war with Hamas.
Aid groups say Gaza faces an ""apocalyptic"" humanitarian situation and is on the verge of being overwhelmed by disease and starvation.
At least 17,490 people, mostly women and children, have died in two months of fighting in the narrow territory, according to the latest figures from Gaza's health ministry.
Washington vetoed a UN resolution that would have called for a ceasefire on Friday, a move strongly condemned by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, as well as humanitarian groups. 
As Israel continued to pound Gaza with air strikes, the Hamas ministry said 71 dead had arrived at Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah alone over 24 hours, and 62 at Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis. 
An AFP correspondent in Nasser hospital saw a child on a makeshift stretcher and others simply sitting on the floor waiting to receive care, while firefighters outside poured water onto the flames of a burning building partly destroyed by an Israeli strike.Alexandra Saieh, of Save the Children, spoke of ""maggots being picked from wounds and children undergoing amputations without anaesthetic"".
The situation ""is not just a catastrophe, it's apocalyptic,"" added Bushra Khalidi of Oxfam.
Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas after its unprecedented attacks on October 7, when militants broke through Gaza's militarised border to kill about 1,200 people and seize hostages, 138 of whom remain captive, according to Israel.
- 'Into the abyss' -
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres triggered the rare Security Council vote on a ceasefire by invoking a measure unused in decades, saying ""the people of Gaza are looking into the abyss"".But the US vetoed the Security Council resolution, with envoy Robert Wood saying it was ""divorced from reality"" and ""would leave Hamas in place, able to repeat what it did on October 7"".
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said a ceasefire would save Hamas ""which is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, and would enable it to continue ruling the Gaza Strip"".
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said he ""holds the United States responsible for the bloodshed of Palestinian children, women and elderly people"" after the veto.
Avril Benoit, head of the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) charity, described the US veto as a ""sharp contrast to the values it professes to uphold"".
There was anger, too, in a residential area of Rafah decimated by an Israeli strike.""What resolution did the Security Council ever approve and was implemented for our cause and Palestinian people?"" local resident Mohammed al-Khatib said amid the rubble.
Hamas denounced the veto as ""a direct participation with the occupation (Israel) in the killing of our people"".
Iran, which backs Hamas, warned it could lead to an ""uncontrollable explosion in the situation of the region"", while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced the UN body as the ""Israel protection council"".
- 'Apocalyptic' situation -
An estimated 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced. 
Blocked from leaving the narrow territory, they have turned Rafah near the crossing with Egypt into a vast camp.One of only two partially operating hospitals in Gaza's north, Al-Awda, ""is surrounded by Israeli troops and tanks, and fighting is ongoing in its vicinity"", the UN said.
Nearby in Jabalia district, the soil in front of shuttered shops had been dug up and turned into a cemetery where men buried more bodies.
Washington, which provides billions of dollars in military aid to Israel, has urged its ally to do more to protect civilians.
""We're going to keep working with our Israeli counterparts to that end,"" said US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby.
- Weapons 'in a school' -
Israel says 93 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza, and two others were severely injured in a failed bid to rescue hostages.Hamas said a hostage, 25-year-old Sahar Baruch, was killed in the operation, later confirmed by his kibbutz community in Beeri, one of the worst-hit on October 7.
With air, naval and ground combat continuing, the military said troops found weapons ""in a school"" in Gaza City.
In Beit Hanun, close to the northern boundary with Israel, troops struck militants ""who shot at them from an UNRWA school and a mosque"", the military said, referring to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
Hamas's armed wing said it fired rockets towards Reim in southern Israel -- the site of the Supernova music festival where 364 people were killed on October 7, according to Israeli figures.Israel said rocket fire had come from a ""designated humanitarian zone"", saying Hamas was exploiting safe areas ""for terrorist activity"". 
There are fears of a wider regional conflict, with regular exchanges between Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.
Israel's army said it had retaliated on Saturday after unspecified ""launches"" from Lebanon, including with fighter jets.
Violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the military says it has arrested 2,200 people, 1,800 of them Hamas members, since the Israel-Hamas war began.
By Adel Zaanoun With Jonah Mandel In Jerusalem",Saturday 09 December 2023 - 18:05pm
Social media titans caught in Gaza storm over content,"WASHINGTON - Six weeks after the eruption of the war in Gaza with the attack by Hamas on Israel, social media platforms are still caught in the maelstrom, struggling to control content and withstand user fury.
TikTok and X, formerly Twitter, were swept up in controversies this week, one involving an unearthing of a two-decade old screed by Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks on the United States.
Facebook and Instagram owner Meta is also facing pushback from users accusing the company founded by Mark Zuckerberg of over-censorship of pro-Palestinian content.
The problems have cast a harsh light on content moderation policies at the big platforms after a big cost-cutting campaign last year saw trust and safety teams gutted.
For TikTok, the risks are real as it faces a threat to be outright banned in the United States, under suspicion that its powerful algorithm is ultimately under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.
Those calls were renewed when it emerged on Thursday that videos promoting bin Laden's ""Letter to America"" went viral, 22 years after he wrote it.
Bin Laden's deeply anti-American writing explained his reasons for masterminding plane attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people.
Searches for the letter were eventually banned by TikTok which minimized the reach of the videos. 
""TikTok is so popular now with younger users, and when you talk about younger users you are talking about uniquely uninformed people,"" said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.
""They do not have enough knowledge of the world to know you can't rely on Osama Bin Laden as your history teacher,"" he added.
 
- 'Flip a switch' -
 
Meanwhile, according to The New York Times, more than a dozen Jewish TikTok celebrities confronted executives this week urging them to stop a surge of anti-Semitism on the app.""What is happening at TikTok is it is creating the biggest anti-Semitic movement since the Nazis,"" Sacha Baron Cohen told TikTok in a 90-minute impassioned phone call, according to the Times.
The ""Borat"" star said TikTok could ""flip a switch"" to stop such videos, which the company denied it could do.
At X, the problems came of mercurial owner Elon Musk's own making, when he endorsed an anti-Semitic post as the ""actual truth,"" setting off a firestorm that saw yet more major advertisers flee the platform.
Apple, Disney, and Lionsgate Entertainment on Friday were reported to have joined IBM in pausing advertising on X.
Musk had engaged with a conspiratorial claim that Jews want to flood the US with minorities to weaken white majorities.
The theory, observers said, was once notoriously promoted by the man who carried out a mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, killing 11 people in the country's deadliest anti-Semitic attack.
Musk's post received a rebuke from the White House and saw left-wing media watchdog Media Matters for America warn major companies that their ads on X were accompanying blatantly anti-Semitic content.
IBM hours later pulled company ads from the site, while the European Union also said it would halt advertising on X because of a surge in disinformation and hate speech. 
 
- 'Not worth it' -
 Musk is one of the world's most powerful people and his behavior on X seems to indicate he is not bothered particularly about spooking advertisers on a site he paid $44 billion for last year.
Privileging free speech over content moderation, the main risk Musk faces is that Apple or Google could one day boot X from their app stores, said Andrew Selepak, assistant media professor at the University of Florida.
""At what point did they decide it's not worth it for us, and they pull their ties to X,"" he said.
Meta so far has managed to avoid some of the harshest attention, in part because Facebook and Instagram are deeply focused on keeping advertisers on board with an army of content moderators compared to other platforms.
Moreover, ""with Meta, the content you see is most likely going to come from people you know offline,"" limiting the chances of being offended compared to TikTok, said Selepak. 
Meta was briefly caught out blocking Instagram accounts that featured the Palestinian flag, which it later apologized for and corrected.
""Censorship of the Palestinian flag emoji on Instagram and unjustified content removal on mass levels is emblematic of Meta's deeply rooted bias and disregard for Palestinian rights,"" said Sarah Philips, campaigner at Fight for the Future, an activist group.
In a statement, Meta in October said ""we can make errors"" and asked users to use their sites' appeals process.

Pope Francis deplores the death of two women in Gaza parish,"Pope Francis on Sunday deplored the death of two women in a Catholic parish in Gaza, where he said ""defenceless civilians"" were targeted by shootings and bombings.
""I continue to receive very serious and painful news from Gaza,"" he said at the end of the Angelus prayer. ""A mother and her daughter... were killed and other people injured by sniper fire.""
""This happened even inside the parish of the Holy Family where there are no terrorists, but families, children, sick or disabled people,"" the pope stressed.
The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said Saturday that a Christian mother and daughter were shot dead by an Israeli soldier on the grounds of the Gaza Strip's only Catholic church.
""Around noon (1000 GMT) today... a sniper of the IDF (Israeli army) murdered two Christian women inside the Holy Family Parish in Gaza,"" where Christian families have been sheltering since the Israel-Hamas war broke out, the patriarchate said in a statement.
""Nahida and her daughter Samar were shot and killed as they walked to the Sister's Convent. One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety,"" it added.
Seven more people were wounded by gunfire as they tried to protect others, the statement said.
""Some say it is terrorism, it's war,"" the pontiff said. ""Yes, it's war, it's terrorism.... let us pray to the Lord for peace,"" he added.
According to the Vatican press agency, citing Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, the victims were an elderly woman and her daughter.
The patriarchate said no warning was given before the shooting started, adding that they were ""shot in cold blood"".The attack saw about 1,140 people killed, mostly civilians, and 250 hostages taken, according to the Israeli authorities' latest figures. 
According to Hamas, Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed 18,800 people, mostly women and children.",Sunday 17 December 2023 - 13:23pm
Gaza aid conference presses for ceasefire,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday opened a conference on humanitarian aid for Gaza by calling for a ""ceasefire"", echoed by other delegates looking to support the Palestinian territory under bombardment by Israel since the October 7 attack by Hamas.
""In the immediate term, we need to work on protecting civilians. To do that, we need a humanitarian pause very quickly and we must work towards a ceasefire,"" Macron told delegates in Paris.
Israel has stayed away from the talks on aid for civilians in the enclave of 2.4 million people, where the Hamas-run health ministry says Israel's military campaign has killed more than 10,500 people, many of them children.
Hamas militants stormed across the border from Gaza into Israel on October 7, killing more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 hostages, Israeli officials say.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel retaliated with a massive, relentless bombardment and ground invasion.
Tens of thousands of civilians have fled towards the south of the Gaza Strip.
But Moshe Tetro, an Israeli military officer handling civil affairs in Gaza, said on Thursday that although ""the civil situation in the Gaza Strip is not an easy one"", the state sees ""no humanitarian crisis"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday reiterated that ""there will be no ceasefire without the release of our hostages,"" saying he wanted to ""put to rest... false rumours"".
A Hamas source had earlier told AFP talks were underway for the release of a dozen hostages held by the Islamists, including six Americans, in return for a three-day ceasefire in Gaza.
""Israel has the right to defend itself and the duty to protect its own people,"" Macron said.
But the government ""also has a clear responsibility... to respect the law and protect civilians,"" he added, warning that the humanitarian situation ""is worsening more and more each day"".
- 'Double standard' -
Thursday's aid conference has been put together in a hurry on the sidelines of the annual Paris Peace Forum on November 10-11.
It has brought together government representatives from many European countries, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority and a slew of aid groups, but no heads of government from the Arab world.
Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry said that ""what the Israeli government is doing far exceeds the right to self-defence,"" accusing the state of ""violations of international humanitarian law"".
""How many Palestinians must die for this war to stop? Is it enough to kill six children and four women every hour?"" Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh asked delegates, urging them to ""end the double standard"" he said existed between Palestinian and Israeli casualties.
The UN estimates that $1.2 billion in aid will be needed for the populations of Gaza and the West Bank from now until the end of the year.
In Paris, delegates hope to reach a shared evaluation of the situation on the ground and to mobilise the international community to lend support -- although no joint declaration is planned at the end of the conference.
France's foreign ministry said there would be sections on donations of goods such as food, fuel and medical supplies, financial support and humanitarian access.
Macron said Paris would increase its financial support from 20 million to 100 million euros ($107 million).
But any promises of aid risk ringing hollow while supplies are being held up at the Gazan border.
""We're going to ask that aid enter Gaza because for now it's just a few trucks each day,"" Philippe Lazzarini, head of the United Nations' Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, told broadcaster France Inter early on Thursday.
He added $100 million was needed just to pay salaries to UNRWA's 30,000 employees.
The world body has ""never registered so many deaths in such a short time in a conflict"" among its staff, he said.
- 'Pause' or ceasefire? -
International concern over the fate of Gaza's civilians, most of whom cannot flee the sealed-off territory, has strengthened calls for humanitarian ""pauses"" or a full ceasefire.
Both European and US leaders are ""having difficulty convincing (Israel) that there should be humanitarian pauses as soon as possible"", European Council head Michel told broadcaster France 2 early on Thursday.
""Israel has the right to defend itself, and this must be in line with the rules of international law,"" he added.
Independent UN expert Balakrishnan Rajagopal said on Wednesday that Israel's widespread and systematic bombardment of housing and civilian infrastructure in Gaza was a ""war crime"", as were indiscriminate Hamas rocket attacks that hit Israeli dwellings.
Israel has for now remained firm in keeping up its offensive, with the stated objective of destroying Hamas -- which has governed Gaza since 2007.",Thursday 09 November 2023 - 14:35pm
Blinken in Israel seeking 'concrete steps' to reduce Gaza civilian harm," 
WASHINGTON - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Israel Friday, an AFP correspondent travelling with him said, in a trip focused on measures to minimise harm to civilians in the war in Gaza.
Prior to his departure, Blinken said he would seek ""concrete steps"" from Israel to ensure that harm to Palestinian civilians is reduced, as US President Joe Biden also called for humanitarian pauses in the conflict.
This is Blinken's second trip to the Middle East since fighting erupted on October 7 after Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out a massive attack on southern Israel that left 1,400 people dead, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials.
In retaliatory Israeli strikes against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, more than 9,000 people have died including more than 3,700 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.
""We will be talking about concrete steps that can and should be taken to minimise harm to men, women and children in Gaza,"" Blinken told reporters before departing for Israel.
""This is something that the United States is committed to.""
""When I see a Palestinian child -- a boy, a girl -- pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child in Israel or anywhere else,"" Blinken said.
""So this is something that we have an obligation to respond to, and we will.""
Biden has promised full support and ramped-up military aid to Israel for its campaign in Gaza, but in a visible shift of tone has also voiced empathy for Palestinian suffering which has stoked anger in parts of the world.
""I think we need a pause,"" Biden said on Thursday at a campaign event.
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby later clarified what such a pause would entail.
""A humanitarian pause... is temporary, localised and focused, focused on a particular objective or objectives, humanitarian aid in, people out,"" Kirby told reporters.

Israel strikes Gaza as pressure grows to free more hostages,"JERUSALEM - Israel carried out fresh strikes on Gaza Sunday as its leaders came under growing pressure to secure the release of hostages still held in the Hamas-run territory more than two months after the October 7 attacks.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced protests on Saturday by relatives of hostages who called for an urgent deal to secure their freedom after the army admitted mistakenly killing three captives in Gaza.
The trio were among an estimated 250 people taken hostage during Hamas's October 7 raids into Israel, which also killed about 1,140 people, according to the Israeli authorities' latest figures.
According to Hamas, Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed 18,800 people, mostly women and children.
At a protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday, relatives of hostages gathered to plea with the government for a deal.
""Take us into consideration and come up with a plan now (for negotiation),"" said Noam Perry, daughter of hostage Haim Perry, at the protest.More than 100 of the Israelis and foreigners seized by Hamas and other militants on October 7 were released in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners during a week-long truce last month, mediated by Qatar.
Netanyahu doubled down on his war effort on Saturday, telling reporters of the three hostages' deaths: ""It broke my heart. It broke the whole nation's heart.""
""With all the deep sorrow, I want to clarify: the military pressure is necessary both for the return of the kidnapped and for achieving victory over our enemies,"" he added.
On Sunday, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, at least 12 people were killed in Israeli strikes on the central city of Deir al-Balah.
Witnesses also reported Israeli air and artillery strikes on the southern municipality of Bani Suhaila east of Khan Yunis, the Gaza Strip's second city.
Also on Saturday, Netanyahu appeared to address Qatari efforts towards a new truce.
""We have serious criticisms of Qatar, about which I suppose you will hear in due course, but right now we are trying to complete the recovery of our hostages,"" he said.
In a statement, Qatar reaffirmed on Saturday its ""ongoing diplomatic efforts to renew the humanitarian pause"".
But Hamas said on Telegram it was ""against any negotiations for the exchange of prisoners until the aggression against our people ceases completely"".US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said late Saturday he was travelling to Israel, Bahrain and Qatar to highlight Washington's ""commitments to strengthening regional security and stability"".
News platform Axios said Israeli spy chief David Barnea met Friday in an unspecified European location with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who helped negotiate the earlier truce.
 
-  'Hunger, disease, weak immunity' -
 
Israel's bombardment of Gaza has left much of the territory in ruins, with the UN estimating 1.9 million Gazans have been displaced by the war.
The UN said this week that hunger and desperation were driving people to seize humanitarian aid being delivered to Gaza, warning of a ""breakdown of civil order"".International aid organisations have struggled to get supplies to desperate Gazans.
""I would not be surprised if people start dying of hunger, or a combination of hunger, disease, weak immunity,"" said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
The agency reported a ""prolonged communications blackout"" across Gaza that started on Thursday night and has continued over the past 48 hours.
US President Joe Biden, whose administration provides billions of dollars in military aid to Israel, has voiced growing concern over civilian deaths.
UK Foreign Minister David Cameron and his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock wrote in The Sunday Times that the ""need is urgent"" for a ""sustainable ceasefire"" in Gaza.
In the face of mounting international pressure, Israel announced a ""temporary measure"" to allow aid deliveries directly to Gaza through the Kerem Shalom border crossing.Fierce fighting raged in Gaza on Saturday, with the Israeli army saying it had raided two schools which it said were Hamas hiding places in the northern Gaza City.
The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said a Christian mother and daughter were shot dead by an Israeli soldier on the grounds of the Gaza Strip's only Catholic church.
""Nahida and her daughter Samar were shot and killed as they walked to the Sister's Convent. One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety,"" the patriarchate said in a statement.
In the city of Khan Yunis, dozens of journalists took part in a funeral for Al Jazeera cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa, who was killed in an Israeli strike, according to his news organisation.
More than 60 journalists and media staff have died since the war began, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
 
- Red Sea disruption -
 
The war continues to be felt across the Middle East and has raised fears of a broader conflict.
Israel has exchanged regular fire with militants, mainly the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah, across its northern border with Lebanon.The Israeli army said on Saturday a soldier was killed and two others wounded in the Margaliot area on the Lebanese boundary. A spokesperson confirmed to AFP the casualties were caused by a ""hostile aircraft"".
The conflict has also caused major disruption to the key Red Sea shipping lane between Asia and Europe, with two more major firms announcing they were redirecting their vessels following repeated attacks by Yemeni rebels allied with Hamas.
The action by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) and CMA CGM follows similar moves on Friday by Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd.
It comes after Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels launched repeated attacks on passing vessels in recent days.
The rebels also launched a wave of 14 one-way attack drones on Saturday, all of which were ""shot down with no damage to ships in the area or reported injuries"", the US military's Central Command said.

More hostages to be freed as Israel-Hamas truce prolonged,"JERUSALEM - Israel and Hamas embarked on a two-day extension Tuesday to a truce that has allowed Israeli hostages to be freed from Gaza in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
Mediator Qatar and Palestinian militant group Hamas confirmed the extension and Israeli media reported the government had received a new list of 10 more hostages who would be freed.
The 7:00 am (0500 GMT) deadline for the previous pause in fighting to expire passed without incident, after 11 more Israeli hostages were freed from Gaza overnight.
This was matched by Israel with the release of another 33 Palestinian prisoners -- the last exchange under the initial deal.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hailed the ""a glimpse of hope and humanity in the middle of the darkness of war"".
The truce paused fighting that began on October 7 when Hamas militants poured over the border into Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping dozens.
Israel's retaliatory ground and air operation in the Gaza Strip has killed almost 15,000 people, mostly civilians, according to the territory's Hamas government.
Despite the truce extension, Israel has vowed to stick to its war aim of destroying Hamas and rescuing all 240 hostages held in the war zone.
 
- 'Sigh of relief' -
 
Eleven hostages arrived in Israel late Monday, the military said, adding: ""Our forces will accompany them until they are reunited with their families.""
Most of the group are dual nationals, with Argentinians, French and Germans among those released, and all 11 were from the Nir Oz kibbutz, the community said.Kibbutz official Osnat Peri said the releases brought ""a sigh of relief to our community, however we remain deeply concerned about our loved ones that are still held hostage"".
Images released by the Israeli military showed French-Israeli child Eitan Yahalomi reunited with his mother, who gripped him tightly to her.
Shortly after the arrival of the hostages was confirmed, Israel's prison authority said 33 Palestinian inmates had been released.
In annexed east Jerusalem, prisoner Muhammad Abu Al-Humus called his release ""an indescribable joy"" and kissed his mother's hand as he entered his home.
Crowds in the West Bank town of Beitunia waved green Hamas flags to greet those arriving on a coach.
But nearby there were also clashes with Israeli troops by Ofer prison, with Palestinians burning tyres and throwing stones. The Palestinian health ministry said one person was killed.
 
- 'Unbearable suffering' -
 
Under the truce, 50 Israeli hostages have been released in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners. Another 19 have been freed under separate deals, including Thai workers and a dual Russian-Israeli citizen.
Hamas said it was now drawing up lists of additional hostages to be released, though the process is reportedly complicated by the fact that some are held by other militant groups.
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that ""in order to extend the pause, Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children"".But it faces increasing pressure for a more lasting ceasefire and the ramp-up of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where an estimated 1.7 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations.
This week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will pay his third wartime visit to the Middle East, meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in Ramallah.
""The secretary will stress the need to sustain the increased flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza, secure the release of all hostages and improve protection to civilians in Gaza,"" a senior US official said.
Blinken would discuss ""the principles he laid out for the future of Gaza and the need to establish an independent Palestinian state,"" the official added.
 
- 'Catastrophic' -
 
Inside Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry said no fuel had arrived for generators at hospitals in the territory's north, despite the truce.And senior UN official Tor Wennesland warned the humanitarian situation ""remains catastrophic"".
The truce has allowed residents who fled fighting in northern Gaza to return to Gaza City, which has been ravaged by relentless Israeli bombardment.
People walked or bicycled along debris-lined streets, where the cars were flattened and buildings torn apart.
A clean-up was underway at Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, which the Israeli army targeted saying Hamas had used it as a command centre.
""We hope it can soon resume its activities,"" said Gaza health ministry spokesman Mahmud Hammad.
A limited number of Palestinians have been airlifted to the United Arab Emirates for treatment after crossing from Gaza to Egypt, including seven-year-old Yussef, who gnawed on his nails next to his mother Nouzha Fawzi.
""He was not like that before,"" she said of Yussef, who suffers the blood disorder hemophilia.
""Since the war, he no longer speaks much. He is afraid of everything,"" she added. ""He asks me if he will die.""

Aid for Gaza piles up as Israel rallies troops for invasion,"GAZA CITY - Desperately needed international aid piled up Friday near Gaza, with Palestinians in dire need of food and water after relentless bombing by Israel, still reeling from the bloodiest attack in its history.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the Islamist militant group launched a massive attack from the Gaza Strip on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians who were shot, mutilated or burned to death, according to Israeli officials.
Hamas gunmen also took nearly 200 people hostage including foreigners from around two dozen countries ranging from Paraguay to Tanzania.
In response, Israeli war planes have levelled entire city blocks in Gaza in preparation for a ground invasion they say is coming soon. More than 3,785 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in the bombing, according to the latest toll from the Hamas-run health ministry.The United Nations says more than one million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced and that the humanitarian situation is worsening by the day, with no green light yet to send in the trucks lined up at the border.
Medicine, water purifiers and blankets were being unloaded at El Arish airport near Gaza, an AFP reporter saw, with Ahmed Ali, head of the Egyptian Red Crescent, saying he was getting ""two to three planes of aid a day"".
The situation inside Gaza is ""beyond catastrophic"", said Sara Alzawqari, UNICEF spokeswoman for the Gulf. ""Time is running out and the numbers of casualties amongst children are rising.""",Friday 20 October 2023 - 09:30am

"Gaza death toll nears 30,000 as aid groups warn of 'imminent' famine","JERUSALEM - The Gaza war's reported Palestinian death toll neared 30,000 Wednesday as fighting raged in the Hamas-run territory despite mediators insisting a truce with Israel could be just days away.
Another 91 people were killed in overnight Israeli bombardment, the health ministry said.
Mediators from Eygpt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to find a path to a ceasefire amid the bitter fighting, with negotiators seeking a six-week pause in the nearly five-month war. 
After a flurry of diplomacy, mediators said a deal could finally be within reach -- reportedly including the release of some Israeli hostages held in Gaza since Hamas's October 7 attack in exchange for several hundred Palestinian detainees held by Israel.
""My hope is by next Monday we'll have a ceasefire"" but ""we're not done yet"", US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday. 
Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said Doha was ""hopeful, not necessarily optimistic, that we can announce something"" before Thursday. 
But he cautioned that ""the situation is still fluid on the ground"".Hamas had been pushing for the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza -- a demand rejected outright by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
But a Hamas source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the deal might see the Israeli military leave ""cities and populated areas"", allowing the return of some displaced Palestinians and humanitarian relief.
Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 29,954 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.
 
- 'Almost inevitable' starvation -
 
The war was triggered by an unprecedented Hamas attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of around 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.Militants also took about 250 hostages, 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 31 presumed dead, according to Israel.
Since the war began, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have been displaced, with nearly 1.5 million people now packed into the far-southern city of Rafah, where Israel has warned it plans to launch a ground offensive.
Those who remain in northern Gaza have been facing an increasingly desperate situation, aid groups have warned.
""If nothing changes, a famine is imminent in northern Gaza,"" the World Food Programme's deputy executive director Carl Skau told the UN Security Council Tuesday. His colleague from the UN humanitarian office OCHA, Ramesh Rajasingham, warned of ""almost inevitable"" widespread starvation. 
The WFP said no humanitarian group had been able to deliver aid to the north for more than a month, with aid blocked from entering by Israeli forces. 
""I have not eaten for two days,"" said Mahmud Khodr, a resident of Jabalia refugee camp in the north, where children roamed with empty pots. 
""There is nothing to eat or drink."" 
 
- Ongoing strikes -
 
Most aid trucks have been halted, but foreign militaries have air dropped supplies including on Tuesday over Rafah and Gaza's main southern city Khan Yunis.What aid does enter Gaza passes through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt, fuelling a warning from UN chief Antonio Guterres that any assault on the city would ""put the final nail in the coffin"" of relief operations in the territory. 
Israel has insisted it would move civilians to safety before sending troops into Rafah but it has not released any details.
Egypt has warned that an assault on the city would have ""catastrophic repercussions across the region"", with Cairo concerned about an influx of refugees.
Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Tuesday that Israel will ""listen to the Egyptians and their interests"", adding that Israel ""cannot conduct an operation"" with the current large population in Rafah.
Ahead of the threatened ground incursion, the area has been hit repeatedly by Israeli air strikes.The army said it had ""killed a number of terrorists and located weapons"" in Zeitun.
It said two more soldiers had died in the fighting in Gaza, taking its overall toll to 242 since the start of the ground offensive on October 27.

Israel says will fight during Ramadan unless Hamas frees hostages,"Deadly fighting raged on in Gaza on Monday after Israel warned that, unless Hamas frees all hostages, it will push on with its offensive during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, including in the far-southern Rafah area.
Global concern has mounted over the fate of 1.4 million Palestinians who have been forced into Rafah near the Egyptian border, enduring bombardment and dire food shortages as they live in crowded makeshift shelters and tents.
Overnight strikes and battles in Gaza killed more than 100 Palestinians, mostly women and children, pushing the death toll past 29,000, said the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, with fighting heaviest in Khan Yunis, just north of Rafah.War cabinet member Benny Gantz warned on Sunday that the Israeli army is ready to push deeper into Rafah during Ramadan which, based on the lunar calendar, starts around March 10.
""The world must know, and Hamas leaders must know: if by Ramadan the hostages are not home, the fighting will continue everywhere to include the Rafah area,"" said Gantz, a former military chief of staff.
""We will do so in a coordinated manner, facilitating the evacuation of civilians in dialogue with American and Egyptian partners and to minimise the civilian casualties as much as possible.""
He added: ""Hamas has a choice. They can surrender, release the hostages, and the civilians of Gaza can celebrate the feast of Ramadan.""Israel has so far failed to specify where Palestinians could flee after more than four months of devastating war have flattened vast swathes of the Gaza Strip.
Egypt has stressed it does not want Gazans to flee into its Sinai territory, arguing that this would facilitate an effort to empty Gaza of its Palestinian population, an objective Israel denies.
Satellite images show that Egypt has started erecting a walled enclosure parallel to the Gaza border, in an apparent precautionary move in case of a mass refugee flight.
 
- 'Total victory' -
 International pressure has grown on Israel to halt the war in the besieged coastal territory, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted the army will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining captives.
Speaking on Sunday, the right-wing premier again vowed ""total victory"" over Hamas, even as he has faced increasing pressure inside Israel from resurgent anti-government protests and desperate relatives of hostages.
The war started when Hamas launched its unprecedented attack of October 7 that left about 1,160 people dead in southern Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
The militants of Hamas, considered a ""terrorist"" group by the United States, EU and other governments, also took about 250 hostages, 130 of whom remain in Gaza, including 30 presumed dead, according to Israel.
Israel's massive retaliatory campaign has killed at least 29,092 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest count by the territory's health ministry.The spiralling humanitarian crisis in Gaza has forced some Palestinians to grind animal feed into flour. 
""My children are starving, they wake up crying from hunger,"" a northern Gaza woman told AFP. ""Where do I get food for them?""
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, which has been bitterly at odds with Israel, said nearly three quarters of Gazans are drinking contaminated water and warned that ""the speed of deterioration in Gaza is unprecedented"".
 
- Besieged hospital -
 Weeks of truce talks involving US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators have failed to bring a deal to pause the fighting, and Israel has rejected Hamas's demands, which include a total withdrawal of its forces.
Heavy fighting has raged in and around Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, which has been besieged for more than a week and which the World Health Organization said is no longer operational.
Israel's army said Saturday it had detained about 100 suspects at the hospital and that it had found medicines there that had been sent for hostages but were never delivered to them.
The Gaza health ministry said seven patients, including a child, had died there since Friday due to power cuts, and ""70 staff including intensive care doctors"" had been arrested.
At least 20 of the 200 patients still there urgently require relocation to other facilities, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, adding that his organisation ""was not permitted to enter"" the site.
Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said diesel and oxygen supplies had been delivered to the hospital and a temporary generator was running.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that in Khan Yunis's Nasser and Al-Amal hospitals, ""troops have operated with great precision to apprehend terrorists, with no resulting civilian casualties"".
 
- 'Genocide' claim -
 With international pressure piling on Israel, the UN's top court opened a week of hearings from Monday examining the legal consequences of the country's 57-year occupation of Palestinian territories.
Palestinian foreign minister Riyad Al-Maliki told the court his people were suffering ""colonialism and apartheid"" under the Israelis.
The hearings, requested by the UN General Assembly, are separate from South Africa's high-profile case alleging Israel is committing genocide in its current Gaza offensive.
Western governments have increasingly pushed for unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state to be part of a wider peace process.But Israel's government on Sunday adopted a declaration that said ""Israel utterly rejects international diktats regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians"". 
It argued any settlement, ""if it is to be reached, will come about solely through direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions"".
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Sunday accused Israel of committing ""genocide"" and compared its actions to Adolf Hitler's campaign to exterminate Jews.
Netanyahu labelled the comments ""shameful"" as well as a ""Holocaust trivialisation and an attempt to harm the Jewish people and the right of Israel to defend itself"".",Monday 19 February 2024 - 13:40pm
Rocket fire from Gaza after Palestinian hunger striker dies,"GAZA CITY - Gaza militants fired rockets Tuesday after the death in Israeli custody of a leading Palestinian figure in the Islamic Jihad group, who had been on hunger strike for nearly three months.
The cross-border fire followed the death of Khader Adnan, who had been on hunger strike since his detention by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank in February.
Israel's prison service announced the death of a detainee affiliated to Islamic Jihad, who was ""found early this morning in his cell unconscious"".
The news was swiftly followed by rocket fire towards Israel, an AFP journalist witnessed, with the Israeli military reporting three rockets ""fell in open areas"".
Adnan's death was described as a ""deliberate assassination"" by Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh.
""By rejecting his request for his release, neglecting him medically and keeping him in his cell, despite the seriousness of his health condition,"" the premier said in a statement.
Adnan, 45, was the first Palestinian to die as a direct result of a hunger strike, according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club.
Other Palestinian detainees have died ""as a result of attempts to force-feed them"", the advocacy group's director, Qaddura Faris, said.
A senior Israeli official described Adnan as ""a hunger striker who refused medical attention, risking his life"".
""In recent days, the military appeal court decided against releasing him from detention solely on the merit of his medical condition,"" said the official, who requested anonymity.
Adnan was described by the official as an ""operative"" with Islamic Jihad, who was facing charges related to his activities within the militant group.
 
- Prisoner's farewell message -
 Islamic Jihad, which is considered a terrorist organisation by the European Union and the United States, warned Israel will ""pay the price for this crime"".
""The free hero, Khader Adnan, died as a martyr in a crime committed by the enemy in front of the world,"" the militant group said in a statement.
Israel's prison service said Adnan was in jail for the 10th time and his wife, Randa Mousa, previously told AFP her husband had carried out multiple hunger strikes in detention.
""(He is) refusing any support, refusing medical examinations, he is in a cell with very difficult detention conditions,"" she told AFP last week.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since the Six-Day War of 1967 and its forces regularly detain Palestinians, who are subject to Israeli military courts.
In his final message, Adnan said he was ""sending you these words as my flesh and fat has melted.""
""I pray that God accept me as a faithful martyr,"" he wrote, in a message published Monday by the Palestinian Prisoners' Club.
A medic from the group Physicians for Human Rights Israel visited Adnan in prison earlier this week and warned that he ""faces imminent death"", while calling for him to be ""urgently transferred to a hospital.""
Israeli authorities had refused to move Adnan to hospital, according to the rights group and his wife.

"UN calls for $294m for 'urgent needs' in Gaza, occupied West Bank","UN - The United Nations on Thursday issued an emergency appeal for $294 million to address ""the most urgent needs"" in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, where more than 400,000 Palestinians have fled their homes in recent days.
The funds would be used to help more than 1.2 million people, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said, adding that recent fighting in the region had left aid groups without adequate resources.
On Saturday, Hamas gunmen swept into small towns, kibbutzim and a music festival in Israel, indiscriminately killing more than 1,200 people and taking about 150 hostages.
Israel has retaliated by raining air and artillery strikes on Gaza -- a densely populated enclave of 2.3 million people -- flattening buildings and killing more than 1,400 people, many of them civilians.
Humanitarian needs compounded by the May 2023 escalation in Gaza and the deterioration of the situation in the West Bank ""have left humanitarian organizations without the resources required to adequately respond to the full range of needs of vulnerable Palestinians,"" OCHA said in its appeal.
The UN has previously estimated it would need $502 to fund operations to aid 2.1 million Palestinians in 2023, a goal that is less than 50-percent financed.
Nearly 60 percent of households in Gaza were considered food insecure before the start of the new hostilities.
As of late Thursday, the number of displaced in Gaza rose by over 84,400 people to reach more than 423,300, according to OCHA figures.
After Israeli strikes on water infrastructure and the cessation of water supplied by Israel to the enclave since Sunday, ""most residents in the Gaza Strip no longer have access to drinking water from service providers or domestic water through pipelines,"" OCHA said. 
""UNICEF reports some have already begun drinking seawater"" in response, it added.
Additionally, ""health facilities are overwhelmed, medical stocks are in short supply and access to hospitals and medical care is being hindered by the ongoing hostilities and damaged roads.""
Gaza is home to some 50,000 pregnant women -- 5,500 of whom are due to give birth in the coming month -- ""who are struggling to access essential health services as healthcare workers, hospitals and clinics come under attack.""
While much of the focus has been on Gaza, ""the situation in the West Bank remains tense,"" OCHA said, citing confrontations between the military and Palestinians, ""settler violence"" and ""extensive closures... imposed around West Bank cities"" impacting access to essential services.

UN warns Gaza faces humanitarian 'collapse' as battles rage,"JERUSALEM - Artillery fire pounded southern Gaza early Wednesday as Israel said it has begun flooding Hamas tunnels and mediators sought a halt to the nearly four-month war.
The focus of the fighting in recent weeks has been Khan Yunis, the southern Gaza Strip's main city, where an AFP correspondent reported constant air strikes and shelling overnight.
The health ministry recorded at least 125 deaths across the Hamas-ruled territory in the latest Israeli strikes.
UN agency chiefs said a bitter row over the main aid agency for Palestinians could ""have catastrophic consequences for the people of Gaza"".
Major donors, including Israel's top ally the United States and Germany, have suspended funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, over accusations that several staff members were involved in the October 7 attack that sparked the war.
Withholding the funds was ""perilous and would result in the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza"", the heads of the UN agencies said in a joint statement.
Meanwhile mediation efforts gathered pace following a Sunday meeting of top US, Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials that produced a proposed framework for a new truce and hostage release.A Hamas official told AFP that a delegation headed by the group's leader Ismail Haniyeh ""will be in Cairo today or tomorrow (Wednesday or Thursday)"" to discuss the proposal.
The war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages. Israel says 132 of them remain in Gaza including at least 29 people believed to have been killed.
Following the deadliest attack in Israel's history, its military launched a withering air, land and sea offensive that has killed at least 26,900 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.
 
- 'Constant fear' -
 
The Israeli army said on Wednesday its troops had killed 15 ""terrorists"" in northern Gaza, and captured 10 militants during a raid on a school where they were allegedly hiding.
In Khan Yunis, where the Hamas government media office said there were ""dozens of air raids"" overnight, vast areas have been reduced to a muddy wasteland of bombed-out buildings.According to witnesses, artillery shells hit the area of Nasser Hospital, the city's largest, where the UN humanitarian agency OCHA has said thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said on social media platform X that ""Israeli shelling and gunfire continue"" around another hospital in Khan Yunis.
Staff and patients at the Red Crescent's Al-Amal Hospital ""and thousands of displaced people, primarily children and women, live in constant fear and anxiety"", it said.
Israel accuses Hamas of operating from tunnels under hospitals in Gaza and of using medical facilities as command centres, a charge denied by the Palestinian group, designated a ""terrorist"" organisation by the European Union and the United States.
The Israeli military said it had begun flooding the tunnels with water in a bid to ""neutralise the threat of Hamas' subterranean network"".
An AFP journalist witnessed people fleeing Khan Yunis on Tuesday as explosions sounded nearby.
""We left Nasser Hospital... under tank fire and air strikes. We didn't know where to go,"" said one woman.
""We're out in the cold, left to fend for ourselves.""
 
- Negotiations -
 
Qatar, which helped broker a previous truce and hostage release in November, voiced hope an initial deal now being negotiated might lead to a permanent ceasefire.The Hamas official said the group is ""open to discussing all issues, including prisoner exchange and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip"", requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.
The official reiterated Hamas's demand for ""a comprehensive and complete cessation of (Israel's) aggression"" and the withdrawal of its troops from Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose office earlier called the negotiations ""constructive"", ruled out releasing ""thousands"" of Palestinian prisoners as part of any deal.
""I would like to make it clear... We will not withdraw the IDF (army) from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousands of terrorists. None of this will happen,"" he said on Tuesday.
Violence involving Iran-backed allies of Hamas across the Middle East has surged during the Israel-Hamas war, also drawing in US forces in the region.
President Joe Biden said Tuesday, without offering details, that he had decided on a response to a recent drone strike that killed three US troops in Jordan.
But ""I don't think we need a wider war in the Middle East,"" Biden said. ""That's not what I'm looking for.""
A pro-Iran group in Iraq, Kataeb Hezbollah, said it would halt attacks on US ""occupation forces, in order to prevent embarrassment to the Iraqi government"".The Huthis on Wednesday said they had fired ""several"" missiles at a US warship, hours after the US military said it had shot down another anti-ship missile over the vital trade route.

Israel orders more Gaza evacuations as envoys seek truce,"JERUSALEM - Israel has ordered more evacuations in southern Gaza's main city as diplomats pressed on with efforts to secure a pause in the war that Hamas says has claimed 20,000 lives.
The United Nations said Israel had issued evacuation orders on Wednesday for large areas of Khan Yunis, where more than 140,000 displaced people were sheltering.
Israel told civilians to leave the north of the besieged Palestinian territory at the beginning of the conflict, urging them to seek safety in southern areas.
But as places for people to go continued to shrink, international outrage has mounted over the rising death toll.
The war began when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
The Hamas government's media office in the Gaza Strip said Wednesday at least 20,000 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory since the war with Israel began.It said 8,000 children and 6,200 women were among the dead.
UN relief chief Martin Griffiths deemed it a ""tragic and shameful milestone"".
In the southern city of Rafah, where fireballs and smoke rose after explosions on Wednesday, residents expressed hope that truce talks would succeed.
""I wish for a complete ceasefire, and to put an end to the series of death and suffering. It's been more than 75 days,"" said Kassem Shurrab, 25.
 
- Truce talks -
 
Hopes that Israel and Hamas could be inching towards another truce and hostage release deal have risen this week as the head of the Palestinian militant group visited Egypt and talks were held in Europe. Qatar-based Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh arrived in Egypt on Wednesday for talks with the country's intelligence chief Abbas Kamel.
Haniyeh also met Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian but no details were released.
A Hamas official told AFP that ""a total ceasefire and a retreat of the Israeli occupation army from the Gaza Strip are a precondition for any serious negotiation"" on a hostage-prisoner swap.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there could be no ceasefire in Gaza before the ""elimination"" of Hamas.
And US President Joe Biden said of a fresh hostage release deal: ""There’s no expectation at this point. But we are pushing it.""
Mossad director David Barnea held a ""positive meeting"" in Warsaw this week with CIA chief Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, a source familiar with the talks told AFP.
Qatar, backed by Egypt and the United States, last month helped broker a first week-long truce that saw 80 Israeli hostages freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
 
- Tunnel network -
 
Israel said Wednesday its troops had uncovered a tunnel network used by Hamas leaders including Yahya Sinwar, the Islamist movement's Gaza leader. The military released footage it said showed the ""large network"" around Gaza City's Palestine Square linking hideouts and residences.
The army reported close-quarter combat and more than 300 strikes over the past day, while the death toll among its own forces rose to 134 inside Gaza.
An AFPTV live camera on Wednesday filmed two bombs hitting Rafah, where many of the territory's estimated 1.9 million displaced have fled.
The Hamas health ministry said Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians when houses and a mosque in Rafah ""were targeted"". 
It said later at least 30 more people were killed in an Israeli strike that hit two houses east of Khan Yunis.
Crowds swarmed the rubble, digging with shovels and a backhoe to try to free the victims. One blackened body lay under a blue blanket on the blood-soaked ground.
""Enough, enough of this. We have lost everything and we can't take it anymore,"" Samar Abu Luli, a woman in Rafah, said after Israeli strikes on the city's Al-Shabura neighbourhood.
 
- UN impasse -
 
The UN Security Council was due to try once again Thursday to pass a resolution calling for a halt in fighting after previous efforts to win Washington's backing fell short.Israel has rejected the term ""ceasefire"", and the US has used its veto twice to thwart resolutions opposed by Israel since the start of the war.
The United Arab Emirates is sponsoring a draft resolution on the conflict which has already been watered down to secure compromise, according to a draft version seen by AFP.  
It calls for ""the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities.""
International Crisis Group analyst Richard Gowan said: ""There is a strong sense that Biden will make the final decision on this.""
Israel, which declared a total siege on Gaza at the start of the war, has since allowed aid trucks through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and, as of this week, its own Kerem Shalom crossing.
The World Food Progamme said Wednesday it had delivered food through Kerem Shalom in a first direct aid convoy from Jordan and warned of the ""risk of starvation"".
 
- Hezbollah fighting -
 The war has sparked fears of regional escalation, with exchanges of fire over the Lebanon border, and missiles from Iran-backed Yemeni rebels disrupting Red Sea shipping.
Israel said Wednesday it had struck an ""operational command centre"" used by Iran-backed Hezbollah militants and fired on fighters heading for the Lebanon-Israel border.The warning came after the United States said it was building up a multinational naval task force to protect vessels transiting the Red Sea from Huthi attacks carried out in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

"G7 backs 'humanitarian pauses' in Gaza, reaffirms Ukraine support","G7 foreign ministers said Wednesday that they supported ""humanitarian pauses and corridors"" in the Hamas-Israel war but refrained from calling for a ceasefire.
The group also said after talks in Japan that their support for Ukraine in its war with Russia ""will never waver"" while calling on China not to support Moscow in the conflict.
""We stress the need for urgent action to address the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza... We support humanitarian pauses and corridors to facilitate urgently needed assistance, civilian movement, and the release of hostages,"" a joint statement said.
The ministers also ""emphasize Israel's right to defend itself and its people in accordance with international law as it seeks to prevent a recurrence"" of the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7.
It added: ""We call on Iran to refrain from providing support for Hamas and taking further actions that destabilize the Middle East, including support for Lebanese Hezbollah and other non-state actors, and to use its influence with those groups to de-escalate regional tensions.""
- 'Overall security' -
The Israeli military has relentlessly bombarded Gaza since October 7, when Hamas militants launched an attack that left 1,400 dead in Israel, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 10,300 people.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday there would be no fuel delivered to Gaza and no ceasefire unless more than 240 hostages seized by Hamas were freed.
He also said Israel would assume ""overall security"" in Gaza after the war ended, while allowing for possible ""tactical pauses"" before then to free captives and deliver aid to the besieged territory.
Washington said Tuesday it opposed a new long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel, a stance reiterated by Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Tokyo.
Key elements for lasting peace and security ""should include no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, not now, not after the war; no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism or other violent attacks; no reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends,"" Blinken told reporters on Wednesday before departing for South Korea.
- Ukraine fatigue -
On the Ukraine war, the G7 statement said: ""Our steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine's fight for its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity will never waver.""
""We further call on China not to assist Russia in its war against Ukraine, to press Russia to stop its military aggression, and to support a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,"" it said.
The ministers from the G7 -- the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Britain and Canada -- also said that they ""welcome China's participation in the Ukraine-led peace process"".
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba joined the G7 meeting by video conference.
With Ukraine's counteroffensive struggling to gain ground after almost two years of war, President Volodymyr Zelensky has regularly met Western leaders to try to stave off fatigue over the conflict.
""It is clear, particularly at this moment, that around the world some (parties) are watching very closely how we will continue to support Ukraine,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said earlier.
French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said it was ""important to remember that the situation in the Middle East in no way distracts us from what is happening in Ukraine"".

'Pity us': Desperate Gazans reel from aid trucks 'massacre',"The crowd flocked to the aid distribution point early Thursday, desperate for food amid Gaza's looming famine, only to be met with lethal chaos including live fire by Israeli troops. 
By mid-afternoon more than 100 people were reported dead in the grisly incident which underscored worsening shortages in the besieged Palestinian territory.
All told, Thursday's ""massacre"" at Gaza City's Nabulsi roundabout killed 104 people and wounded 760, said Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry.
Just hours, earlier the Palestinian death toll from the nearly five-month-old war in Gaza had topped 30,000.
But there were conflicting reports on what exactly was responsible for Thursday's deaths. 
Qudra blamed Israeli troops, and Israeli sources confirmed to AFP that the Israeli forces at the scene did open fire, having perceived the crowds near the trucks as a ""threat"". 
A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, however, said many of the dead were crushed by the trucks themselves.
""Aid trucks were overwhelmed by people trying to loot and drivers ploughed into the crowd of people, ultimately killing tens of people,"" said the spokesman, Avi Hyman. 
A young Palestinian man who was among the wounded spoke of chaotic scenes.
""There were crowds of people, but the occupation (forces) kept firing towards us,"" the man told AFP while lying on the dirty, crowded floor at Kamal Adwan Hospital waiting for treatment 
Outside, four women in headscarves wailed while clutching at the lifeless body of a bearded man wrapped in white cloth, while men lined up to pray nearby. 
At Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, doctors were ""unable to deal"" with the flood of casualties ""as a result of weak medical and human capacities,"" Qudra said. 
Hamas, whose unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel kicked off the war, denounced what it described as a ""hideous and heinous"" massacre. 
 
- 'Storming' scarce trucks -
The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of around 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures. 
Israel's withering military response has now killed at least 30,035 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry, which does not specify how many fighters are included in the toll. 
The offensive has caused widespread devastation in Gaza and severe shortages of food, water and medicine.
For months, aid workers have warned of an increasingly desperate situation for Gazan civilians, and on Monday an official from the UN humanitarian office OCHA said widespread starvation was ""almost inevitable"". 
UN estimates show that 2.2 million people -- the vast majority of Gaza's population -- are threatened with famine, particularly in the north where destruction, fighting and looting make the delivery of food almost impossible.
According to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, just over 2,300 aid trucks have entered the Gaza Strip in February, down by around 50 percent compared to January. 
That is an average of well below 100 trucks per day, down from around 500 that were entering daily before the war. 
It was precisely that scarcity that drove crowds to rush the trucks at Nabulsi roundabout on Thursday, a witness told AFP.Aerial footage distributed by the Israeli military showed large groups approaching a line of moving trucks on foot. 
""Trucks full of aid came too close to some army tanks that were in the area and the crowd, thousands of people, just stormed the trucks,"" the witness said, declining to be named for safety reasons.  
""The soldiers fired at the crowd as people came too close to the tanks.""  
 
- 'Under siege' -
Thursday's incident in Gaza City spurred a heated exchange at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, where Palestinian ambassador Ibrahim Mohammad Khraishi confronted his Israeli counterpart about the reported casualties. 
""Are these human shields? Are these Hamas combatants?"" Khraishi asked. 
Israel says it wants to eliminate Hamas, but diplomats are scrambling to broker a truce before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is set to begin on March 10 or March 11, depending on the lunar calendar. 
At Kamal Adwan hospital, a Palestinian woman checking on relatives caught up in the chaos at Nabulsi roundabout said the world should ""take pity"" on Gazans. 
""My nephews went there to bring flour, but they (Israeli forces) fired on them,"" said the woman, who did not give her name. 
""We are under siege. Take pity on us. Ramadan is coming soon. People should look at us. Pity us.""",Thursday 29 February 2024 - 17:30pm
"Israel-Palestine conflict | Death toll in Gaza passes 27,000","JOHANNESBURG - The death toll in Gaza has now exceeded 27,000 as Israel continues its relentless bombardment.
The situation is further exacerbated by the suspension of financial aid to the UN Relief and Works Agency.

It comes after Israel accused some of its workers of helping Hamas during the 7th October attack last year.
Monica Genya from Doctors Without Borders said not enough humanitarian aid or medical supplies are coming in.

""With a population that is still under siege, the humanitarian situation is just as bad as it was, it's not getting any better,"" Genya said.
She said the humanitarian crisis has reached catastrophic levels.

Israel says it mistakenly killed three Gaza hostages,"TEL AVIV - Israel said its troops had killed three Gaza hostages after mistaking them for a threat, with the armed forces expressing ""deep remorse"" over a ""tragic incident"" that sparked protests in Tel Aviv.
The Israeli military said Yotam Haim, Alon Shamriz and Samer El-Talalqa were shot during operations in a neighbourhood of Gaza City.
The trio were among those kidnapped during Hamas's raids into Israel on October 7, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw an estimated 240 hostages taken, according to Israeli authorities.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the death of the three hostages as an ""unbearable tragedy"", while the White House called the incident a ""tragic mistake"".
As news of the incident spread, hundreds of people gathered at Israel's ministry of defence in the city of Tel Aviv in protest.
The demonstrators waved Israeli flags and brandished placards with the faces of some of the 129 people still held in Gaza.
""Every day, a hostage dies,"" read one of the placards.
In retaliation for the worst attacks in its history, Israel launched an air and ground assault on Gaza, vowing to destroy Hamas, which rules the territory, and bring the hostages back.
Hamas says the war has killed at least 18,800 people, and reduced swathes of Gaza to rubble.
In Tel Aviv, relatives of hostages called on the government to reach an accord to allow more people to be freed.
""I am dying of fear,"" said Merav Svirsky, sister of Hamas-held hostage Itay Svirsky. ""We demand a deal now.""In November, a short-lived truce agreement mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States saw more than 100 hostages freed in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
News platform Axios on Friday reported that the director of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, David Barnea, was due to meet this weekend in Europe with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.
Axios said the officials would discuss resuming negotiations for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages.
In the Gaza Strip, fierce fighting continued, with Hamas claiming they had blown up a house containing Israeli soldiers in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
News channel Al Jazeera said that one of its journalists, Samer Abudaqa, had been killed and another, Wael Dahdouh, had been wounded by ""shrapnel from an Israeli missile attack"" in Khan Yunis.
More than 60 journalists and media staff have died since the war began, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
""We were reporting, we were filming, we had finished and we were with the civil defence, but when we were on the way back, they hit us with a missile,"" said Dahdouh, who lost his wife, two children and grandchild earlier in the war.
 
- Trickle of aid -
 
The United States, which provides billions of dollars in military aid to Israel, supports the war to destroy Hamas, but has voiced growing concern over civilian casualties.
In Washington, US President Joe Biden reiterated calls for greater care.
""I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives -- not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful,"" said Biden.
Biden's top security advisor Jake Sullivan was visiting Israel and the West Bank to drive that message home.In the face of growing international pressure, Israel announced a ""temporary measure"" allowing aid to be delivered directly to Gaza through the Kerem Shalom border crossing.
Since the war began, a trickle of aid has squeezed into Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. 
Aid agencies have said the volume is nothing like enough to help the estimated 1.9 million Gazans displaced by the war.  
US National Security Advisor Sullivan called the decision to reopen Kerem Shalom as a ""significant step"". 
The United States hopes ""this new opening will ease congestion and help facilitate the delivery of life-saving assistance"", Sullivan added.
A World Health Organization representative said the announcement was ""very good news"".
Sullivan also travelled to the West Bank to meet Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, who said Gaza must remain an ""integral part"" of the Palestinian state. 
Abbas's Palestinian Authority has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, but is deeply unpopular with Palestinians and has been further weakened by the war.However, Washington still hopes that it can resume control of Gaza as part of a renewed push for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- a solution that Netanyahu has resolutely opposed. 
The conflict has appeared to push any peace deal further out of view.
In Jerusalem, for the first time in weeks, sirens warned of incoming rockets from Gaza.
Residents rushed to safety, and the rockets all hit open ground or were intercepted by air defences, the army said.
Multiple Western governments issued a joint statement demanding that Israel ""take concrete steps to halt unprecedented violence by Israeli settlers"" in the West Bank. 
Attacks by settlers since early October have killed eight Palestinians and wounded 83, they said.
Israel's police force said it had suspended several officers after they severely assaulted a journalist for Turkish news agency Anadolu as he was trying to take photos of Palestinians praying in annexed east Jerusalem. 
 
- Red Sea shipping disrupted -
 
The war continues to be felt across the Middle East.
Global shipping lines Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd announced they were halting voyages through the Red Sea following attacks on vessels by Yemeni rebels allied with Hamas. The rebels later said they fired missiles at two other ships in the Red Sea.

"Israel and Hamas agree truce, hostages for prisoners swap","GAZA - Israel and Hamas said on Wednesday they had agreed on a four-day truce in the Gaza war during which the Palestinian militant group would free at least 50 of the hostages they took in their deadly October 7 attack.
In turn, Israel would release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow more humanitarian aid into the coastal territory after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and crippling siege.
The hostages to be freed are women and children, and the Palestinian prisoners are women and detainees aged 18 and younger. The process could begin Thursday at 10 am according to regional media reports.The deal -- negotiated with Qatar, the United States and Egypt -- is the first major breakthrough in Gaza's bloodiest ever war that has killed thousands and left much of the territory in ruins.
Although it promises a truce that could be extended if more captives are freed, Israel has vowed to stick to its war aim of destroying Hamas and rescuing all 240 hostages held in the war zone.
""We are very happy that a partial release is pending,"" Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum group said in a statement. 
""As of now, we don't know exactly who will be released when.""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose cabinet approved the truce after a marathon overnight session, told his ministers that this was a ""difficult decision but it's a right decision"".
The cabinet's sign-off was one of the last hurdles after what one US official described as five ""extremely excruciating"" weeks of talks. 
Hamas welcomed the ""humanitarian truce"" and an official of the Islamist group told AFP that ""the resistance is committed to the truce as long as the occupation honours it"".
- 'Brave souls' -The war started after Hamas on October 7 launched the worst attack in Israel's history that left around 1,200 people dead, most of them civilians, according to the Israeli government.
Israel launched a major bombing campaign and then a ground offensive in Gaza which, according to the Hamas government, has killed 14,100 people, thousands of them children.
Israel said that, to facilitate the hostage release, it would initiate a four-day ""pause"" in its air assault of Gaza.
If the initial phase works, a subsequent phase could see 150 more Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for 50 more hostages, said an Israeli government document naming 300 eligible prisoners.
For every 10 additional hostages released, there would be an extra day's ""pause"" in fighting, the document said. Hamas and Islamic Jihad group sources earlier told AFP the truce would apply to ground operations as well as air operations over southern Gaza.
The negotiations have involved the US Central Intelligence Agency, Israel's Mossad, Egyptian intelligence and leaders in Doha, Cairo, Washington, Gaza and Israel.
A senior US official said three Americans, including three-year-old Abigail Mor Idan, were among the 50 earmarked for staggered release from Thursday.
US President Joe Biden said he was ""extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls... will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented"".
- 'Pain in my heart' -
Families on both sides grappled with a lack of clarity over how the releases would unfold. Israel's list of eligible Palestinian prisoners included 33 women and 123 detainees under 18.  
Amani Sarahneh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group, said ""we don't know who will be freed first, and that's a problem for us in responding to the families"". 
Among the Palestinians slated for release is Shrouq Dwayyat, convicted of attempted murder in a 2015 knife attack.
Her mother Sameera Dwayyat said ""I had hoped that she would come out in a deal"" but added that her relief was tempered by ""great pain in my heart"" over the dead children in Gaza.
Large parts of Gaza have been flattened by thousands of air strikes, and the territory faces shortages of food, water and fuel.For now, Israel appeared to be pushing on with its offensive in northern Gaza, with witnesses reporting dawn strikes on Kamal Adwan hospital and nearby homes. 
Medical workers treated bloodied, dust-covered survivors as other residents fled through debris-strewn streets to safety.
The Hamas-run government said 200 people had been killed by Israeli forces in the past 24 hours.
""The people are really suffering,"" Gaza resident Hamza Abdel Razeq said, voicing hope for some respite during a truce: ""I believe it will pave the way for longer truces or even a total ceasefire.""
- 'Full force' -The Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank also hailed the deal and reiterated its call for ""a comprehensive cessation of the Israeli aggression"" and more aid deliveries.
Ahead of the Israeli cabinet vote, Netanyahu had faced criticism from within his right-wing coalition, where some argued the deal gave too much to the Palestinian militants.
Hardline Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir said it should include the release of Israeli soldiers also taken by Hamas.But with dozens of families in Israel desperate to have their loved ones returned home, and the public gripped by the hostages' fate, the government ultimately set aside any misgivings.
At a Tel Aviv plaza now known as Hostages Square, Doron Klein, 49, told AFP he was ""hopeful"" child hostages would come home but said the deal could pose ""risks"" to the military operation. 
""I think the fear of everybody is that this will give the Hamas time to reorganise and we'll pay a price with more soldiers that will be killed,"" he said.
Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant stressed that ""immediately after we have exhausted this phase"", military operations would ""continue in full force"".

WHO rejects Israel's claim of 'collusion' with Hamas,"The World Health Organization on Friday denied Israel's claim that the WHO was in collusion with Hamas by ignoring Israeli evidence of the ""military use"" of hospitals in the Gaza Strip.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also said that such accusations could endanger its staff on the ground.
Tedros was responding to claims made Thursday by Israeli ambassador Meirav Eilon Shahar at a meeting of the UN health agency's board.
""WHO refutes Israel's accusation at the executive board meeting yesterday that WHO is in 'collusion' with Hamas and is 'turning a blind eye' to the suffering of hostages being held in Gaza,"" Tedros said on X.
""Such false claims are harmful and can endanger our staff who are risking their lives to serve the vulnerable.
""As a United Nations agency, WHO is impartial and is working for the health and well-being of all people.""
Earlier this month he told a press conference that healthcare should always be protected. It ""cannot be attacked and it cannot be militarised"", he said.
Eilon Shahar had said Hamas was embedding itself in hospitals in the Gaza Strip and was using human shields in the Palestinian territory.
In ""every single hospital that the IDF searched in Gaza, it found evidence of Hamas' military use,"" she said Thursday.
""These are undeniable facts that WHO chooses to ignore time and time again. This is not incompetence; it is collusion.
""The WHO knew hostages were held in hospitals and that terrorists operated within.
""Even when presented with concrete evidence of what was happening below ground and above ground ... WHO chooses to turn a blind eye, jeopardising those they are meant to protect.""
 
- Situation 'beyond words' -
 
War erupted on October 7 when Hamas and other militants from Gaza launched unprecedented  attacks on Israel which claimed about 1,140 lives, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
Militants also seized 250 hostages, and Israel says around 132 remain in Gaza. That number includes at least 28 dead hostages, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Israel, in response, launched a relentless military offensive that the Palestinian territory's health ministry says has killed at least 26,083 people.
On Thursday, Tedros was moved to tears as he addressed the executive board. The fact that 70 percent of the fatalities in the Gaza Strip have been women and children should be motive enough to bring about a ""long overdue"" ceasefire, he said.
""If we look for a solution it's always possible,"" he added, after pausing to compose himself. ""It's only the will that's required.""
Tedros occasionally becomes emotional when speaking about the impact of war on children, citing his own early years in Ethiopia.
""I am a true believer because of my own experience that war doesn't bring solutions except more war, more hatred, more agony, more destruction,"" he said Thursday.
""I'm struggling to speak because... the situation is beyond words,"" he said, wiping his eyes.

"Gazans living in 'utter, deepening horror': UN","GAZA - Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are living in ""utter, deepening horror"", the UN human rights chief said Wednesday, as he pleaded for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
READ: Israel expands offensive in Gaza
Volker Turk said there was a high risk of atrocity crimes being committed in such ""catastrophic"" humanitarian circumstances.""
""Civilians in Gaza continue to be relentlessly bombarded by Israel and collectively punished -- suffering death, siege, destruction and deprivation of the most essential human needs such as food, water, lifesaving medical supplies and other essentials on a massive scale,"" he told a press conference. 
""Palestinians in Gaza are living in utter, deepening horror."" 
He said 1.9 million of the Palestinian enclave's 2.2 million people had been displaced and were being pushed into ""ever-diminishing and extremely overcrowded places in southern Gaza, in unsanitary and unhealthy conditions"".
""The catastrophic situation we see unfolding in the Gaza Strip was entirely foreseeable and preventable.
""In these circumstances, there is a heightened risk of atrocity crimes,"" the United Nations high commissioner for human rights said.
""As an immediate step, I call for an urgent cessation of hostilities and the release of all hostages,"" he said, adding: ""you need to come back to your senses"".
 
- 'Hateful rhetoric' -
 
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group's 7 October attacks that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities, and saw around 240 hostages taken into Gaza.
The latest toll from the Hamas-run government media office said 16,248 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, had been killed.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and free 138 hostages still held after scores were released during a short-lived truce.Turk said he was gravely concerned by ""dehumanising and inciteful statements"" made by current and former Israeli officials, as well as Hamas figures. 
""History has shown us where this kind of language can lead,"" he said. 
""This is not just unacceptable, but a competent court may view such statements, in the circumstances in which they were made, as incitement to atrocity crimes."" 
Decrying a sharp rise in hate speech globally over the past two months -- in particular anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim bigotry -- he said political leaders using ""inflammatory, toxic and hateful rhetoric... must be vigorously condemned"".
 
- Push for peace -
 
Turk said the human rights crisis in the occupied West Bank was also ""extremely alarming"", calling for Israeli authorities to take immediate steps to end ""widespread impunity"" for violations.
""The only way to end the accumulative sufferings is ending the occupation and achieving the two-state solution,"" he said.
Turk said he had met Palestinians and Israelis who want a peaceful future for both sides, whose voices were currently not being heard.
""I hope that they will be much stronger in the future,"" he said.
""One thing is very clear: it cannot go back to what it was.""",Wednesday 06 December 2023 - 17:11pm
Israeli-Palestinian peace camp shaken but determined,"GAZA - The Israel-Palestinian peace camp has long promoted dialogue against hatred and bloodshed but the passions inflamed by the deadliest Gaza war yet pose entirely new challenges for the movement.  
Many of its activists believe that talking to each other is now more important than ever, at a time when the fighting rages unabated and both sides mourn their dead. 
""It wasn't easy before the war,"" said Sulaiman Khatib of Combatants for Peace, a group he co-founded in 2006 and whose Israeli and Palestinian members hold weekly meetings and frequent protests.
""But now it's even more difficult, starting with the relationship with each of the societies, both in Israel and in Palestine, where the extremes have risen.""
The Gaza war has brought levels of suffering unusual even by the brutal standards of the decades-old conflict that has seen two Palestinian uprisings and four previous Gaza wars. 
Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, mutilating corpses and dragging some 240 hostages back into the blockaded territory.
Israel has responded with an intense air and ground war that has levelled vast areas of Gaza and claimed more than 14,000 lives according to the Hamas government, while its 2.4 million people endure a punishing siege.
One recent evening, a small group of around 40 Israeli and Palestinian activists gathered by the walls of Jerusalem's Old City to observe 15 minutes' silence for ""all the dead"". 
Standing with their eyes closed or crying, or sitting cross-legged, they listened to Jewish and Christian prayers under the gaze of often sceptical passers-by. 
One onlooker remarked in an angry whisper, ""How dare the Arabs do that?""
- 'Dehumanisation at a high' -
The peace camp has always made some people bristle on both sides and become ever more marginalised. 
Yet it still counts more than 200 organisations, some more than 40 years old. 
Among their ranks are environmentalists for peace, motorists who drive Palestinians to visit doctors in Israel, and joint Israeli-Palestinian choirs.
They remain convinced that they have been right to advocate dialogue. 
One group, the Parents Circle, is made up of Israeli and Palestinian families bereaved by the conflict. 
""I already see people who may come and join us after so much violence,"" said its co-director Yuval Rahamim, based in Tel Aviv.
""It will be part of the personal process for some.""
Most activists, initially stunned into silence by the October 7 attacks, resumed their discussion groups a few days later.
It hasn't been easy, they say, and not just because of logistical hurdles such as additional roadblocks in the occupied West Bank.
""It has never been that difficult to hear the other's point of view,"" said Avner Wishnitzer, another co-founder of Combatants for Peace.
In the current wartime climate, he said, all sides are torn by ""the pain, the fear"". 
""Dehumanisation is at a high point. It will intensify. People -- of course not all -- are ready to see the other side's babies killed.
""There is no place for nuance, complexity. There is a rise of extremism on both sides"".
Reflecting on the peace groups, he said, ""we are a minority, maybe a smaller minority now. The space for free speech has narrowed significantly.""
- 'People are on edge' -
The hurt from October 7 runs even deeper for some because peace activists were among the victims. One of them was Vivian Silver, a founder of Women Wage Peace, who died at Kibbutz Beeri. 
Khatib acknowledged the movement has been badly shaken and that many activists struggle with mixed and confusing emotions.
""There are many members who go to sleep consumed by frustration and wake up optimistic,"" he said. ""It's not black and white, people are on edge.
""What has happened is so staggering that we don't want to participate in a form of status quo by persisting with our old ways of doing things.""
Some non-government groups fear they will lose funding as donors reassess their relationships or redirect their cash to Gaza aid relief. 
The Alliance for Middle East Peace, with more than 160 member groups, receives distraught calls every day from its members.
Its member Nivine Sandouka urged ""an international peace fund"" to be set up, modelled on past fund-raising efforts for conflict-torn Northern Ireland. 
The group's veteran activist Doubi Schwartz said the movement will need time to find its bearings to maintain the dialogue towards peace.
""The red lines are part of the difficult and honest discussions between Israeli and Palestinian peace activists,"" he said. ""The discussion about it will last for decades. 
""The conversation we share and the ways we operate will evolve significantly. But the fact that people still want to talk to each other is something that makes me optimistic.""

Israel and Gaza at war after Hamas launches surprise attack,"GAZA - Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a large-scale surprise attack against Israel on Saturday, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza and sending fighters to kill or abduct people as Israel retaliated with devastating air strikes. 
At least 70 people were reported killed in Israel, while Gaza authorities released a death toll of 198 in the conflict's bloodiest escalation in years which also left hundreds more wounded on both sides.
""We are at war,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the military launched a series of strikes against targets in the blockaded coastal enclave, including several residential tower blocks that were completely destroyed.""The enemy will pay an unprecedented price,"" the veteran Israeli premier vowed after Hamas launched its first such combined air, sea and ground offensive, half a century after the outbreak of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.
Hamas has released images of several Israelis taken captive, and Israel army spokesman Daniel Hagari confirmed that ""there are kidnapped soldiers and civilians. I can't give figures about them at the moment. It's a war crime committed by Hamas and they will pay the price.""The Islamist group started the attack around 6:30 am (0330 GMT) with thousands of rockets aimed as far as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, some bypassing the Iron Dome defence system and hitting buildings.
Hamas fighters -- travelling in vehicles, boats and even using motorised paragliders -- breached Gaza's security barrier and attacked nearby Israeli towns and military posts, opening fire on residents and passersby.
Bodies were seen lying on the streets of the town of Sderot near Gaza.""Send help, please!"" one Israeli woman sheltering with her two-year-old child pleaded as militants outside opened fire at her house and tried to break into their safe room, Israeli media reported.
AFP journalists witnessed armed Palestinians gathered around a burning Israeli tank and others driving a seized Israeli Humvee military vehicle back into Gaza.
 
- 'Gates of hell' -
 Israeli army Major General Ghasan Alyan warned Hamas had ""opened the gates of hell"".
The army said its forces were engaged in live gun battles in several locations near the Gaza Strip, in an operation labelled ""Swords of Iron"".
An AFP journalist in Gaza saw smoke billowing from the remains of a residential tower following Israeli strikes, which Gaza's interior ministry said contained 100 apartments and was completely destroyed. 
Israel's military said it had warned residents to evacuate before targeting two multistorey buildings used by Hamas.The aid group Doctors without Borders said one strike had hit the enclave's Indonesian hospital and an ambulance outside Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, causing multiple deaths.
The escalation follows months of rising violence, mostly in the occupied West Bank, and tensions around Gaza's border and at contested holy sites in Jerusalem.
Hamas labelled its attack ""Operation Al-Aqsa Flood"" and called on ""resistance fighters in the West Bank"" as well as in ""Arab and Islamic nations"" to join the battle.""We decided to put an end to all the crimes of the occupation (Israel),"" said its armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, claiming to have fired more than 5,000 rockets.
Army spokesman Richard Hecht said Israel had counted at least 2,200 rockets aimed at its territory.
Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh claimed the group was on the ""verge of a great victory and a clear conquest on the Gaza front"".
""Enough is enough,"" he said in a televised address. ""The cycle of intifadas (uprisings) and revolutions in the battle to liberate our land and our prisoners languishing in occupation prisons must be completed.""
 
- Bodies in the streets -
 Air raid sirens wailed across southern and central Israel, as well as in Jerusalem, where multiple incoming rockets were intercepted by air defence systems.
In Tel Aviv, an AFP photographer saw a gaping hole in a building, with residents boarding a bus to seek safety in a hotel.
Rocket impacts left cars burning beneath residential buildings in the Israeli city of Ashkelon, north of Gaza.Among the dead was the president of a regional council for Israeli communities northeast of Gaza, who the council said was killed in a gun battle with attackers.
Schools will remain closed on Sunday, the start of the week in Israel.
The conflict sparked major disruption at Tel Aviv airport, with American Airlines, Emirates and Ryanair among  carriers with cancelled flights.
 
- 'Dangerous precipice' -
 Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, leading to Israel's crippling blockade of the impoverished enclave of 2.3 million people.
Israel and Hamas have since fought several wars. The last major military exchange, in May, killed 34 Palestinians and one Israeli.
In northern Gaza on Saturday, hundreds of people fled their homes, carrying food and blankets, an AFP correspondent said. 
At Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital an AFP journalist saw eight bodies in the morgue, while another reporter witnessed the funeral of a ninth person killed in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.In Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, some Palestinian residents cheered and blew their car horns as sirens blared.
Western capitals condemned the attacks by Hamas, which the European Union, United States and Israel consider a terrorist group.
UN Security Council chair Brazil said it would call an emergency meeting. 
But Hamas drew support from other foes of Israel, with Iran's supreme leader declaring he was ""proud"" of the Hamas action.Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which fought a war against Israel in 2006, hailed the ""heroic operation"".
US President Joe Biden was briefed on the ""appalling Hamas terrorist attacks,"" said the White House, stressing that Washington would ensure Israel has the means to defend itself.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the attack ""terrorism in its most despicable form"".
UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said the assault had led to ""a dangerous precipice"" and called for all sides to ""pull back from the brink"".az-rsc-jd/fz

Deadly fighting grinds on in Gaza's Khan Yunis,"Israel pressed its blistering assault on the Gazan city of Khan Yunis Thursday, with the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas saying dozens were killed in heavy bombardment and urban combat.
The Israeli army says it has ""encircled"" Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas's Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar, accused of being the mastermind of the October 7 attacks that sparked the war.
An AFP journalist said the bombardment of Khan Yunis was relentless, with strikes hitting every few minutes.
Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, reported fierce clashes in the centre and west of the city, where fighting has been inching closer to hospitals sheltering thousands of displaced people.
Its health ministry said at least 50 people were killed in Khan Yunis over the past 24 hours. The army said several militants were killed in ""close-quarters combat"" in the city, and that strikes also targeted militants in central and northern Gaza.
At Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, AFPTV footage showed graves with the names of those buried scrawled on them in crayon amid debris-strewn streets and pockmarked buildings.
""Those look like graves, but they are not proper ones,"" said Ahmad Abdul Salam, a resident of the city's Al-Maghazi refugee camp. ""We buried whole families, who were wiped out, inside these mass graves.""The war erupted when Hamas and other militants from Gaza launched the unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel which claimed about 1,140 lives, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
Militants also seized 250 hostages, and Israel says around 132 remain in Gaza. That number includes the bodies of at least 28 dead hostages, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Israel in response vowed to crush Hamas and launched a relentless military offensive that the Palestinian territory's health ministry says has killed at least 25,700 people, about 70 percent of them women and children.
- 'Terrified' hospital staff -
Another 12 people were killed on Wednesday when two tank shells struck a UN building sheltering 800 people in Khan Yunis, the United Nations said, updating its previous toll of nine dead.Thomas White, the Gaza director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), denounced ""persistent attacks on civilian sites"" in Khan Yunis as ""utterly unacceptable"".
Intense fighting near hospitals in Khan Yunis had ""effectively encircled these facilities, leaving terrified staff, patients and displaced people trapped inside"", he said in a statement.
Asked about the shelling, the Israeli army said ""a thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is underway"", adding it was examining the possibility that the strike was a ""result of Hamas fire"".The Israeli military is the only force known to have tanks operating in the Gaza Strip.
The United States also condemned the bombardment, with State Department spokesman Vedant Patel saying ""civilians must be protected and the protected nature of UN facilities must be respected"".
- Israeli protests -
The government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced mounting calls for a ceasefire, with domestic pressure intensifying after 24 soldiers were killed Monday in the army's deadliest single day since it launched its Gaza ground operations.In Tel Aviv, Israeli protesters carried a banner saying: ""Stop the bloodshed,"" and blocked a road during a demonstration to demand a deal for the release of the hostages held by Hamas.
""We came to say to the government: 'It's enough.' We want all the hostages back home, we want a ceasefire now,"" said protester Sapir Sluzker Amran. 
""There is no military solution, only a diplomatic solution -- only agreements will bring the hostages back.""Netanyahu, however, has been adamant the war will continue, telling parliament on Wednesday that the fighting would persist until the ""aggression and evil"" of Hamas were destroyed.
""This is a war for our home,"" he said. 
US President Joe Biden's Middle East envoy Brett McGurk was in the region for talks aimed at brokering a new deal to free the remaining captives in exchange for a pause in fighting.
A Palestinian source familiar with the talks said a Hamas delegation had travelled to Cairo this week to meet Egypt's intelligence chief and discuss new ceasefire proposals.
- Kamikaze drones -
Egypt and Qatar have acted as mediators in the conflict, including in November, when a brief truce agreement led to the release of 105 hostages.But Netanyahu was allegedly caught on tape telling hostages' families this week that Qatar's mediation was ""problematic"", blaming it for funding Hamas.
The Gulf state said it was ""appalled"" at the remarks, which ""if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives"".
The Gaza war has sparked fears of a wider escalation, with a surge in violence involving Iran-aligned Hamas allies across the Middle East.
On Thursday, Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement said it attacked Israeli air defence systems across the border with one-way drones.The UN's International Court of Justice will on Friday hand down its initial ruling on a genocide case brought against Israel by South Africa.
The ruling could potentially order Israel to stop its Gaza military campaign, although the Hague-based court has little power to enforce its judgements.
Netanyahu has already hinted he would not feel bound by any ICJ order, saying on January 14 that ""no-one will stop us -- not even The Hague"".

US troops depart for mission to build Gaza aid port,"Four US Army vessels departed a base in Virginia on Tuesday carrying about 100 soldiers and equipment needed to build a temporary port on Gaza's coast for urgently needed aid deliveries.
The first -- a hulking gray-painted watercraft known as a Logistics Support Vessel -- slowly churned away from the pier at Joint Base Langley-Eustis as ""The Imperial March"" from ""Star Wars"" played over its loudspeaker system.
It was followed by three smaller vessels that will also make the roughly 30-day trip to the eastern Mediterranean for the port mission -- part of US efforts to boost assistance for Gaza as Israel delays deliveries of aid by ground.
The new facility -- which will consist of an offshore platform for transshipment of aid from larger to smaller vessels and a pier to bring it ashore -- is expected to be up and running ""at the 60-day mark,"" US Army Brigadier General Brad Hinson told journalists.
""Once we get fully mission-capable, we will be able to push up to two million meals, or two million bottles of water, ashore each day,"" he said.
US officials have said the effort will not involve ""boots on the ground"" in Gaza, but American troops will come close to the beleaguered coastal territory as they construct the pier, which has to be anchored to the shore.
 
- No ceasefire yet -""I'm not going to go into the specifics of who we're working with in order to anchor the pier, but we will have some assistance,"" said Hinson, who also declined to discuss security measures.
Asked if the planned deployment will still take place in the absence of a ceasefire in Gaza -- which Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas have yet to agree to -- Hinson said: ""We have every intent to set this capability up over the next 60 days.""
However, a senior US administration official cautioned last week that a ceasefire is needed ""to really address the urgent needs of the civilian population in Gaza and to enable humanitarian partners to safely distribute life-saving aid throughout Gaza at the scale that is needed.""
A total of some 500 troops from the 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary) will take part in the operation, Hinson said, describing it as ""the premier watercraft unit in our Army.""
""They can provide sustainment support over the water in austere environments. They are trained to do this, and they've gone on many exercises to be ready to provide this capability,"" he said.
 
- Gaza in crisis -
Gaza has faced relentless bombardment by Israel since Hamas launched a cross-border attack on October 7 that resulted in about 1,160 deaths, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Israel's retaliatory operations in Hamas-controlled Gaza have killed 31,184 Palestinian, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.
The amount of aid brought into Gaza by truck has plummeted during five months of war, and Gazans are facing dire shortages of food, water and medicine.
The United States has carried out a series of airdrops to deliver aid this month, but the number of people in need of assistance in Gaza is much greater than can be fed by drops alone.
US President Joe Biden announced the plan for the temporary port during his State of the Union address last week, in which he pleaded with Israel to let more assistance into the blockaded territory even as he defended its right to strike back at Hamas.
Another Logistics Support Vessel has already departed, leaving ""less than 36 hours after President Biden announced the US would provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza by sea,"" the US Central Command said over the weekend.",Tuesday 12 March 2024 - 20:50pm

Chaos in south Gaza hospitals after new Israeli strikes,"GAZA - Patients lie on cold, bloodstained floors in hospitals filled to overflowing. Some scream in pain, but others lie silently, deathly white, too weak even to cry out.
Hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip have descended into chaos since the resumption of the war between the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel.
After eight weeks of war, interrupted only by one seven-day pause that ended on Friday, the doctors are exhausted.
Fuel reserves have almost run dry because of Israel's blockade of the territory, so doctors are forced to choose when and where across their hospitals to run generators.
According to the United Nations, not a single hospital in the territory's north can currently operate on patients.
The most seriously wounded are transferred daily to the south by convoys organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
But even there, the UN says, the 12 remaining hospitals are only ""partially functional"".
Abdelkarim Abu Warda and his nine-year-old daughter Huda have just arrived at Deir al-Balah Hospital aboard one of the ICRC convoys.On Friday, after the truce ended, an Israeli strike hit their house in the vast Jabalia refugee camp in the north.
Huda was wounded in the head. ""She had a brain haemorrhage -- she was placed on a ventilator,"" her father told AFP.
Since then, ""she hasn't responded to anything"", he says, lifting up the little girl's arms.
""She doesn't answer me any more,"" he repeats, sobbing.
 
- No words -
 
It is daybreak and the first prayers for the dead are being performed.
A few dozen men gather in front of white body bags lined up on the ground.
Between two larger bags lies the small shroud of a child, close to his or her parents even in death.
Women in tears crouch down to touch a face or kiss a loved one for one last time before the bodies are carefully loaded into the back of a pickup.
""It's Adam going... and there is Abdullah,"" says one woman, weeping.At the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis, the largest medical facility in southern Gaza, the story is the same.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Sunday he was unable to ""find words strong enough"" to express his concerns about the conditions there.
Members of a WHO team who visited found it packed with 1,000 patients, three times its capacity.
Patients were being treated on the floor ""screaming in pain"", with ""countless people... seeking shelter, filling every corner"", the WHO chief wrote.
Israel unleashed its air and ground campaign in response to Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which killed around 1,200 people and saw some 240 kidnapped, Israeli officials say.
The Hamas government that runs Gaza says the Israeli campaign has killed more than 15,500 people -- including 280 medical staff -- since it began eight weeks ago.
 
- 'Saw the bomb fall' -
 
Israel, which has vowed to eliminate Hamas, says it is now focusing on the southern city of Khan Yunis.
The army drops warning leaflets on neighbourhoods due to be targeted each day, telling residents that a ""terrible attack is imminent"" and ordering them to leave.
Each day, too, the warnings move closer to the hospital.
With each new explosion that shakes the city, more casualties arrive, often in private cars.
Staff race out with stretchers which are often still stained with blood from the previous patient.
Some bodies arrive unaccompanied, and so cannot even be identified.
In the corridors, families, the wounded and medical staff all jostle together.
Some tend to the patients, sliding a sweater or a T-shirt under the head of an wounded person lying on the hard floor.
Ehab al-Najjar, a man with several family members both alive and dead at the hospital, lets his anger explode.
""I came home and saw the bomb fall on our house. Women, children died. What did they do to deserve this?"" he screams.

"As clock ticks down, Israel touts 'option' to extend Gaza truce","GAZA - Israel said on Monday it was open to extending a truce with Hamas if the Palestinian group continues to release hostages, as international pressure mounted for a longer pause in the Gaza fighting.
If no extension is agreed the temporary truce is due to expire at 7:00 am (0500 GMT) on Tuesday, threatening a return to intense fighting in a war that has already left many thousands dead.
US President Joe Biden, top EU envoy Josep Borrell and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg have all joined a global chorus urging the parties to extend their temporary break in fighting.
Israel had put Hamas ""on notice"" that an ""option for an extension"" of the truce was open in order to bring home 50 more Israeli hostages in the coming days, government spokesman Eylon Levy told reporters, potentially implying a five-day extension.
As part of the truce deal, Hamas has so far released 39 Israeli hostages, including a four-year-old girl orphaned by the group's October 7 attack, with more expected later Monday.
Israel has freed 117 Palestinian prisoners in exchange under the terms of the agreement. A further 19 foreign nationals have also been released from Gaza under separate arrangements.Tearful reunions of families and hostages, released in exchange for dozens of Palestinian prisoners, have brought the first relief from images of civilian death and suffering in the seven-week war, with hopes high for an extension.
""That's our goal, to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into those in need in Gaza,"" Biden said Sunday, calling for operations to remove Hamas to be paused for ""as long as prisoners keep coming out"".
 
- 'Long lasting' pause -
 
The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell echoed this call as the truce entered its final 24 hours, saying: ""The pause should be extended to make it sustainable and long lasting while working for a political solution."" 
""Nothing can justify the indiscriminate brutality Hamas unleashed against civilians,"" he said. ""But one horror cannot justify another horror.""
NATO chief Stoltenberg also weighed in, ahead of a meeting of allied foreign ministers in Brussels.""I call for an extension of the pause. This would allow for much needed relief to the people of Gaza and the release of more hostages,"" he told journalists.
Hamas has signalled its willingness to extend the truce, with a source telling AFP the group told mediators they were open to prolonging it by ""two to four days"".
""The resistance believes it is possible to ensure the release of 20 to 40 Israeli prisoners"" in that time, the source close to the movement said.
Under the truce, 50 hostages held by the militants were to be freed over four days in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners. A built-in mechanism extends the truce if at least 10 Israeli captives are released each extra day.
But some hostages are believed to be held by Palestinian militant groups other than Hamas, potentially complicating future releases. Israel is also facing pressure from the families of hostages to extend the truce to secure more releases.
 
- Orphaned hostage freed -
 Three successive days of hostage releases have buoyed spirits in Israel, with tearful reunions weeks after Hamas militants poured across the border on October 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials.
In response, Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas, killing nearly 15,000 people, mostly civilians and including thousands of children, according to Gaza's Hamas government.
The third group of hostages released Sunday included a four-year-old American citizen called Abigail whose parents were both killed in the Hamas attacks.
""What a joy to see her with us. But on the other hand, what a pity that she returns to the reality of not having parents,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
""She has no parents, but she has a whole nation that embraces her,"" he added.
Also among those freed Sunday was an 84-year-old woman who was rushed to intensive care in critical condition ""after serious neglect"", medical officials said.Separately, an Israeli soldier rescued from the Gaza Strip welcomed the releases of her fellow hostages, in her first public comments since she was freed.
Ori Megidish, 19, was operating an observation post on the Gaza border when she was seized in the Hamas attacks. Her rescue was confirmed by the Israeli military just over three weeks later, but no details have since been released.
In a relaxed video filmed at her home and posted to her TikTok account, she said she was ""fine"" and ""happy to see all the moving clips of hostages returning to their families"". 
 
- Fight 'until victory' -
 
Israel has faced mounting pressure to extend the pause mediated by Qatar, the United States and Egypt, though its leaders have dismissed any suggestions of a lasting halt to the offensive.
""We continue until the end -- until victory,"" Netanyahu said in Gaza on Sunday, on the first visit by an Israeli premier since 2005.Wearing military fatigues and surrounded by soldiers, Netanyahu vowed to free all the hostages and ""eliminate Hamas"", in footage posted online by his office.
In another sign of mounting international concern, UN rights experts called Monday for independent investigations into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out in Israel and the Palestinian territories since October 7.
Morris Tidball-Binz, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, and Alice Jill Edwards, the special rapporteur on torture, issued a joint statement stressing the need for ""prompt, transparent and independent investigations"".

Hamas brutality doesn't justify 'punishment' of Palestinians: UN chief,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday that Hamas brutality could never justify ""collective punishment"" of Palestinians as Israel presses its campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Guterres convened an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council after weeks of fighting left more than 17,487 people dead in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
He and a group of Arab countries are seeking a vote on an immediate ceasefire, but the veto-wielding United States said it was opposed to such a move, making it highly unlikely that such a motion would succeed.
""Some 130 hostages are still held captive. I call for their immediate and unconditional release, as well as their humane treatment and visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross until they are freed,"" Guterres said.
""At the same time, the brutality perpetrated by Hamas can never justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.""
Vowing to destroy the Islamist movement, Israel has relentlessly bombarded Gaza and sent in tanks and ground troops since the war began on October 7 with unprecedented attacks by Hamas on southern Israel.
Those attacks left 1,200 people dead, Israel says.
""I unreservedly condemn those attacks. I am appalled by the reports of sexual violence,"" Guterres said. 
""There is no possible justification for deliberately killing some 1,200 people, including 33 children, injuring thousands more, and taking hundreds of hostages.""
Guterres deployed rarely-used Article 99 of the UN Charter to bring to the council's attention ""any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security"".
No one in his job had done this in decades.
Guterres is seeking a ""humanitarian ceasefire"" to prevent ""a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians"" and the entire Middle East.
But deputy US ambassador Robert Wood said: ""While the United States strongly supports the durable peace, in which both Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security, we do not support calls for an immediate ceasefire.""
""This would only plant the seeds for the next war,"" he added.
- 'Laws of war' -After Guterres sent his urgent letter, the United Arab Emirates prepared a draft resolution that will be put to a vote later Friday, said the delegation from Ecuador, which chairs the council this month and thus decides on scheduling issues.
The latest version of this document seen Thursday by AFP calls the humanitarian situation in Gaza ""catastrophic"" and ""demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.""
The short text also calls for the protection of civilians, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages in Hamas captivity, and humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip.
Several previous attempts to pass a resolution calling for a ceasefire have been vetoed.
France's ambassador to the UN, Nicolas de Riviere, said ""I don't think we can wait forever."" 
""But rushing to a vote without negotiating would be a big mistake.. I think 5:30 pm is too early,"" he said.
Washington, Israel's closest ally on the world stage, has said that a new resolution would not be ""useful"" at this stage.
""Today, this council will vote. It will have an opportunity to respond to the deafening calls across the world to bring this violence to an end,"" said the United Arab Emirates' deputy ambassador, Mohamed Issa Abushahab.
Vast areas of Gaza have been reduced to a wasteland. The United Nations says about 80 percent of the population has been displaced, facing shortages of food, fuel, water and medicine, along with the threat of disease.
""International humanitarian law includes the duty to protect civilians,"" Guterres said.",Friday 08 December 2023 - 19:01pm

"Israel pressed on two-state solution, pounds south Gaza","GAZA - Palestinians sheltered from intense fighting in southern Gaza where communications were cut again on Monday, as pressure mounted on Israel for a solution involving long-sought Palestinian statehood.
Mahdi Antar, 21, sought refuge at Al-Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis, Gaza's main southern city which has become the epicentre of the war between Hamas militants and Israeli soldiers now in its fourth month.
""The situation is terrifying. Tonight and today are very difficult, bombing and shooting. I do not know what to do,"" he said.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip reported on Monday that more than 120 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours.
Victims of the latest Israeli strikes were brought to Al-Nasser hospital and mourners buried corpses in a mass grave, AFP journalists saw.The war broke out with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attacks that resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
In response, Israel has carried out a relentless offensive that has killed at least 25,295 people in Gaza, around 70 percent of them women, children and adolescents, according to Gaza's health ministry.
Israel announced the deaths of three soldiers, raising the toll to 198 since ground operations in Gaza started in late October.
The Hamas attack also saw about 250 hostages seized, and Israel says around 132 remain in Gaza.This includes the bodies of at least 28 dead hostages, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli data.
Relatives of the captives and campaigners for their release, who have held regular rallies demanding action from the Israeli government to free them, on Monday stormed a parliamentary committee meeting.
""You sit here while our children are dying over there,"" yelled Gilad Korngold, father of hostage Tal Shoham, an AFP correspondent reported.
Telecoms operator Paltel said that services in Gaza were cut off on Monday ""due to the ongoing and escalating aggression"", the 10th time since the war began.
 
- 'Other solutions?' -
 
The fresh strikes on southern Gaza came as European foreign ministers held meetings in Brussels with top diplomats from the warring sides and key Arab states.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told Israel ""peace and stability cannot be built only by military means"".
""Which are the other solutions they have in mind? To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill them off?""
Alleviating the humanitarian crisis must be the priority as more hardship for Gazans will not defeat Hamas or increase Israel's security, Borrell added.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has drawn condemnation from the United Nations and defied the United States -- which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid -- by rejecting calls for a Palestinian state.
The Palestinian Authority's top diplomat, Riyad al-Maliki, demanded the European Union call for an immediate ceasefire and urged it to consider sanctions against Netanyahu for ""destroying the chances for a two-state solution"".Israel's top diplomat Israel Katz ignored questions from journalists over a future two-state solution and said his government was focused on returning the hostages and ensuring its own security.
The war has spurred fears of a wider escalation, with a surge in violence involving Iran-backed Hamas allies across the region.
At least 202 people have been killed in south Lebanon since early October, according to an AFP tally, as Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants traded near-daily fire. On the Israeli side, 15 people have been killed.
Yemen's Huthi rebels announced they had fired missiles at a US military ship in the Gulf of Aden near the Red Sea, but a US defence official said no attack had taken place.
 
- 'Heading to the unknown' -
 
UN agencies and aid groups have sounded the alarm about the growing threat of disease and famine claiming more lives in Gaza than fighting.The territory's health system is sagging under the weight of the hostilities and an Israeli siege that has triggered dire shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society on Monday called on the international community to protect its staff and facilities, particularly its headquarters and Al-Amal hospital in Khan Yunis.
The Israeli army said 12,000 trucks carrying 1,052 tons of medical aid have entered Gaza since the war began.
French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu, on a visit to Israel, told AFP he hoped medicines delivered to Gaza last week under a deal mediated by France and Qatar would reach ""every hostage"".
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees estimates the war has displaced 1.7 million Gazans.
Abu Iyad, his belongings piled on a donkey-drawn cart, told AFP he was on the move for the seventh time.
He was fleeing Khan Yunis for Rafah near the Egyptian border, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have settled, many living in makeshift tents.
""I'm heading to the unknown,"" he said.
""They told us to go to Rafah, where to go in Rafah? Is there any space left?""

Gaza communications down as Israel searches main hospital,"GAZA - Israeli troops carried out building-by-building searches at Gaza's main hospital, as a new communications blackout in the territory on Friday compounded fears for Palestinian civilians trapped inside the facility.
Al-Shifa hospital has become a focal point for Israeli operations in northern Gaza since soldiers raided the complex on Wednesday, hunting for a command centre they say militant group Hamas operates there.
Hamas and hospital managers deny that charge, and there has been international concern about several thousand people -- including wounded patients and premature babies -- believed to be trapped inside.
Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas in response to the group's October 7 attack, which killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and saw about 240 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.
Israel's air bombardment and ground operation has killed 11,500 people, including thousands of children, according to Hamas-run local authorities in Gaza.
Israeli authorities have defended their operation, and the military said Thursday it found rifles, ammunition, explosives and the entrance to a tunnel shaft at Al-Shifa.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged hostages may even have been held at the medical facility.
""We had strong indications that they were held in the Shifa Hospital, which is one of the reasons we entered the hospital,"" he told ""CBS Evening News"".
""If they were [there], they were taken out,"" he said. 
Allegations about the hospital have not been verified, and on Friday communications with the Gaza Strip were severed once again.The UN warned that the blackout would compound the misery of civilians, complicating efforts to distribute aid and possibly triggering looting of its supplies.
""When you have a blackout and you cannot communicate with anyone anymore... that triggers and fuels even more the anxiety and the panic,"" said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA.
 
- 'Immediate possibility of starvation' -
 Israel said its forces were searching Al-Shifa ""one building at a time,"" and announced the discovery of the body of a woman hostage at a building nearby.
Yehudit Weiss, 65, was kidnapped from her home in the border kibbutz community of Beeri, one of the areas worst-hit by the brutal Hamas assault.
Her husband was killed in the attack, a hostage support group said.
On Thursday, Jews and Arabs came together for the funeral of another casualty of the Beeri attack -- peace activist Vivian Silver, who was hailed as an ""extraordinary woman"".
Negotiations are ongoing for the release of the hostages, some of them just infants, in exchange for a pause in fighting.
Qatar, where Hamas has political offices, and Egypt have been mediating what Egypt's foreign minister described Thursday as ""very delicate"" discussions. 
""We are hopeful that our efforts and the efforts of others will bring about the speedy release,"" Sameh Shoukry said.
On the ground, conditions are rapidly deteriorating for Palestinian civilians, UN agencies have warned. 
Over 1.5 million people have been internally displaced, and Israel's blockade of the territory means ""civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,"" World Food Programme executive director Cindy McCain said.
Food and water have become ""practically non-existent,"" the agency added, with Lazzarini describing children sheltering at a UN school ""pleading for a sip of water, or for a loaf of bread"".
 
- 'Settler violence' -
 
 
Israel's ground operation has so far focused on the north of the Gaza Strip, where it has announced the seizure of the parliament building, government offices, Hamas police headquarters and a key port. It says 51 of its troops have been killed in the fighting.Hospitals have become a particular target, with Israel saying it has found tunnels or military equipment at the Al-Shifa, Rantisi and Al-Quds facilities.
Palestinian health officials said Thursday that the Al-Ahli hospital was under attack, with the Palestinian Red Crescent saying casualties in the courtyard could not be reached by medical staff because of explosions and gunfire.
Washington has backed Israel's allegations that Hamas is using hospitals as command centres, while urging operations be ""incredibly careful"".
More than half of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functional, due to either combat, damage, or shortages, and Israel's raid on Al-Shifa left extensive damage to the radiology, burns and dialysis unit, the Hamas-run health ministry said.
With international concern about the conflict growing, the UN Security Council on Wednesday passed a resolution urging ""urgent and extended humanitarian pauses"" in fighting.
But the resolution -- passed with abstentions from the United States, Britain and Russia -- was rejected by Israel as ""disconnected from reality.""
Alongside the conflict in Gaza, there is growing concern about violence in the West Bank, where violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians has surged.
In an attack claimed by Hamas, three gunmen on Thursday killed an Israeli soldier and wounded five others at a checkpoint leading into Jerusalem from the West Bank.
Overnight, a large deployment of Israeli troops raided the Jenin refugee camp, AFP reporters there said, prompting clashes. Israel's military did not immediately comment.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday urged Israel to take ""urgent"" action to ""de-escalate tensions in the West Bank, including by confronting rising levels of settler extremist violence,"" the State Department said.
Elsewhere, Israeli warplanes again hit targets near the Syrian capital, Syria's state news agency reported. The strikes caused damage but there were no reports of casualties.

'Harrowing': WHO decries deadly strike on Gaza refugee camp,"World Health Organization staff visited Monday a Gaza hospital receiving casualties from deadly strikes on a refugee camp, hearing distressing stories of entire families killed and seeing dying children.
""WHO's team heard harrowing accounts shared by health workers and victims of the suffering caused by the explosions,"" the UN health agency chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.
""One child had lost their whole family in the strike on the camp. A nurse at the hospital suffered the same loss,"" he said.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says that at least 70 people were killed in Israeli strikes late Sunday on three houses in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp.
AFP was unable to independently verify the toll.
The Israeli military said it was ""reviewing the incident"" and ""committed to international law including taking feasible steps to minimise harm to civilians"".
Rows of victims' bodies, shrouded in white bags, lined the ground at Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, ahead of a mass funeral.
The Al-Aqsa hospital staff had reported receiving around 100 casualties from the blasts, Tedros said.
""The hospital is taking in far more patients than its bed capacity and staff can handle,"" he said.
""Many will not survive the wait,"" he warned, insisting ""this latest strike on a Gazan community shows just why we need a #CeasefireNOW"".
The war broke out when Hamas fighters launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 and killed about 1,140 people, mainly civilians, and seized 250 hostages, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Israel has responded with a relentless military campaign that has killed at least 20,670 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.
- 'Unacceptable situation' -
Sean Casey, a WHO Emergency Medical Teams coordinator who was on Monday's mission to Al-Aqsa hospital, described doctors providing pain relief to a critically injured nine-year-old boy named Ahmed.
He ""was being treated basically with sedation to ease his suffering as he dies"", Casey said in a video shot inside Al-Aqsa, seeming to fight back tears.
""He was crossing the street in front of the shelter where his family is staying and the building beside him blew up,"" he said.
""He was hit by shrapnel, by rubble, his brain matter was exposed.
""There's nothing anybody can do for him. Like so many cases here, there isn't capacity to manage complex neurological cases, complex trauma cases,"" he said.
WHO has warned that only nine of Gaza's original 36 hospitals remain even partially functional.
""We as an international community should not accept that thousands upon thousands of people, children are being blown up, being killed while they're crossing the street, while they're sleeping in their beds,"" Casey said.
""This is an unacceptable situation,"" he said, demanding a ceasefire. ""This has to stop.""",Tuesday 26 December 2023 - 05:30am
Israel pounds Gaza as Red Cross warns of 'intolerable' suffering,"GAZA CITY - Israel further intensified its attacks on Gaza, warning its war on Hamas would be ""long and difficult"", as calls mounted to end the violence and the Red Cross warned of ""intolerable"" suffering.
The United Nations said thousands more civilians could die in Gaza as Israel announced the war had entered a ""second stage"", with ground forces still operating inside the Hamas-run territory more than 24 hours after entering it on Friday.
Israel unleashed a massive bombing campaign after Hamas gunmen stormed across the Gaza border on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and seizing 230 hostages, according to Israeli officials.
Since then, relentless Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed more than 8,000 people, half of them children, the Hamas-controlled health ministry in the territory said Saturday.
Communications were meanwhile gradually being restored in Gaza on Sunday after a more than 24-hour blackout. Thousands of buildings have been flattened in the overcrowded territory of 2.4 million people, with more than half the population displaced as Israel imposed a near-total siege.
Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, voiced shock Saturday at the ""intolerable level of human suffering"", urging all sides to de-escalate the conflict.
""This is a catastrophic failing that the world must not tolerate.""But despite increasingly frantic appeals for an end to the violence, Israel says it is intensifying its ground operations, while continuing to pummel Gaza from the sky.
Hamas authorities reported Sunday a ""large number"" of people killed overnight in strikes on two refugee camps in northern Gaza.
Israel's Home Front Command earlier warned residents in the southern cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon of incoming missile and rocket attacks.
The intense strikes against Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, provided cover for Israeli ground forces to step up operations, ahead of an expected full-blown invasion.
""Since early Friday evening, combined combat forces of armour, combat engineers and infantry have been operating on the ground in the northern Gaza Strip,"" the Israeli army said late Saturday.",Sunday 29 October 2023 - 07:00am
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to undergo hernia surgery as Gaza war rages,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to undergo hernia surgery on Sunday, his office said, as fighting raged almost six months into the Gaza war.
The news comes with Netanyahu under increasing domestic pressure over his failure to bring home all of the hostages still held by Palestinian militants.
Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Yariv Levin will stand in while Netanyahu, 74, undergoes full anaesthesia, his office said.
It added that doctors had discovered the hernia on Saturday during a routine checkup, and that after consultations the decision was made for the premier to undergo surgery after completing his daily schedule.
Deadly air strikes again pounded the Gaza Strip as talks towards a truce between Israel and Hamas were set to resume in Cairo on Sunday, according to Egyptian television, though a Hamas official expressed pessimism about the process.To help alleviate the suffering of Gaza's 2.4 million people, an aid ship was sailing from the Mediterranean island-nation of Cyprus to bring 400 tonnes of food, as part of a small flotilla.
Foreign powers have ramped up aid airdrops, although United Nations agencies and charities warn this falls far short of the dire need and say trucks are the most efficient way of delivering aid. 
Several people have died in stampedes or drowned trying to retrieve packages from the sea.
- Pope's Easter appeal -
On Thursday the world's top court ordered Israel to ""ensure urgent humanitarian assistance"" in Gaza without delay, saying ""famine is setting in"".
At least 77 people were killed in bombardment and combat during the previous 24 hours, most of them women and children, said the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.
A UN Security Council resolution on March 25 demanded an ""immediate ceasefire"" and the release of all hostages held by militants, but the binding resolution has failed to curb the fighting, including in or around hospitals.Tensions have risen between Israel and its chief backer the United States over the spiralling civilian death toll, and especially over Israeli threats to send ground forces into Gaza's crowded far-southern city of Rafah.
Washington has nonetheless approved billions of dollars worth of bombs and fighter jets for Israel in recent days, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed officials.
Pope Francis, in his Easter message, renewed his appeal that ""access to humanitarian aid be ensured to Gaza and call once more for the prompt release of the hostages seized on October 7"", when Hamas attacked Israel and triggered the war.
Speaking at the Vatican, Francis called again ""for an immediate ceasefire"" in Gaza.
- Mass protests in Tel Aviv -Hamas's attack resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 32,782 people, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
Palestinian militants also seized around 250 Israeli and foreign hostages. Israel believes about 130 remain in Gaza, including 34 who are presumed dead. 
Under intense pressure to bring the captives home, Netanyahu on Friday approved a new round of ceasefire talks to take place in Doha and Cairo.
Egyptian TV station Al-Qahera, which is close to the country's intelligence services, said that the talks would resume in Cairo on Sunday. But a Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP the Islamist group had not decided on whether to send a delegation to the new round ""in Cairo or Doha.""
The official also expressed doubt the process could bring results because Netanyahu is ""not interested.""
Netanyahu has vowed to continue the fight by sending troops in against Hamas fighters in Rafah, where around 1.5 million civilians are sheltering.
Relatives and supporters of hostages held by Hamas have held regular protests, including Saturday night in Tel Aviv, where police used water cannon against demonstrators who lit fires and blocked highways. 
""Prime minister, on behalf of the hostage men and women, on behalf of the people of Israel, give the negotiators in Qatar the order: Do not return without a deal,"" said Raz Ben Ami, a survivor of Hamas captivity.
Anti-government demonstrators and hostage supporters planned to rally again Sunday evening outside the Knesset, the parliament in Jerusalem, and every night until Wednesday, said organisers.
- Battles near hospitals -
In Gaza, vast areas of which have been reduced to a rubble-strewn wasteland, heavy fighting has rocked areas around several Gaza hospitals. Israel accuses Palestinian militants of hiding inside and in tunnels beneath the medical facilities, and of using patients and medical staff as cover, charges which the groups deny.
The army said Saturday that it had ""continued to eliminate"" militants around the largest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, after earlier reporting around 200 killed in the operation which began two weeks ago on Monday.
The Gaza health ministry said 107 patients remained inside Al-Shifa, including 30 with disabilities, and that the army had stopped attempts to evacuate them.
The army said soldiers raiding the hospital's maternity ward had found ""many weapons hidden inside pillows, hospital beds, ceilings and the walls of the compound, including dozens of mortar shells, explosive devices, sniper rifles, Kalashnikov rifles, pistols, magazines, mortars and additional ammunition"".
It added that during a sweep of the compound, troops encountered ""senior terrorists"" in a stairwell and killed them during a subsequent exchange of fire.Israeli military operations were also ongoing at two hospitals in the southern city of Khan Yunis -- at Nasser hospital, according to the Hamas government press office, and at Al-Amal hospital, according to the Red Crescent.
The UN World Health Organization warned that Gaza now has just 10 ""minimally functioning"" hospitals, down from 36 before the war.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that 9,000 patients need to leave Gaza for ""lifesaving health services, including treatment for cancer, injuries from bombardments, kidney dialysis and other chronic conditions"".

Israel's Netanyahu approves new Gaza ceasefire talks,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approved Friday new talks on a Gaza ceasefire, a day after the world's top court ordered Israel to ensure urgent humanitarian aid reaches people in the Palestinian territory.
But despite a binding United Nations Security Council resolution this week demanding an ""immediate ceasefire"", fighting continued Friday, including around hospitals.
Regional fallout from the conflict also flared, with Israel saying it killed a Hezbollah rocket commander in Lebanon, and several Hezbollah fighters killed in Syria strikes that a war monitor blamed on Israel.
Netanyahu's office said new talks on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release will take place in Doha and Cairo ""in the coming days... with guidelines for moving forward in the negotiations"", days after they appeared stalled.
In its order, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague said: ""Palestinians in Gaza are no longer facing only a risk of famine, but... famine is setting in.""
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, posted on X that the ruling was ""a stark reminder that the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is man made + worsening"".
The court had ruled in January that Israel must facilitate ""urgently needed"" humanitarian aid to Gaza and prevent genocidal acts, but Israel rejected the case brought by South Africa.
The latest binding ICJ ruling, which has little means of enforcement, came as Israel's military said Friday it was continuing operations in Al-Shifa Hospital, the territory's largest, for a 12th day.
Throughout the coastal territory, dozens of people were killed overnight, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said.Among the dead were 12 people killed in a home in the southern city of Rafah, which has been regularly bombed ahead of a mooted Israeli ground operation there.
Men worked under the light of mobile phones to free people trapped under debris after an air strike, AFPTV images showed.
The ICJ ordered Israel to ""take all necessary and effective measures to ensure, without delay"" the supply ""of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance"".
- 'Immediate ceasefire' -
The war began with Hamas's October 7 attack that resulted in about 1,160 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.
Israel's retaliatory campaign to destroy Hamas has killed at least 32,623 people, mostly women and children, Gaza's health ministry says.
Large parts of the territory have been reduced to rubble, and most of Gaza's population are now sheltering in Rafah.On Monday the UN Security Council demanded an ""immediate ceasefire"" in Gaza, the release of hostages held by militants, and ""ensuring humanitarian access"".
Member states are obliged to abide by such resolutions, but the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) charity said  nothing has changed on the ground.
Aid groups say only a fraction of the supplies required have been allowed in since October, when Israel placed Gaza under near-total siege.
Israel has blamed shortages on the Palestinian side, namely a lack of capacity to distribute aid, with humanitarians saying not enough trucks are allowed in to make deliveries.
With limited ground access, several nations have staged airdrops, and a sea corridor from Cyprus has delivered its first food aid.
- Heavy damage -
The UN says Gaza's health system is collapsing ""due to ongoing hostilities and access constraints"".
Israel's military accuses Hamas and the Islamic Jihad of hiding inside medical facilities, using patients, staff and displaced people for cover -- charges the militants have denied.On Friday the army said it was ""continuing precise operation activities in Shifa Hospital"" where it began a raid early last week.
Troops first raided Al-Shifa in November, before Israel in January announced it had ""completed the dismantling"" of Hamas's command structure in northern Gaza. Palestinian militants and commanders had since returned to Al-Shifa, the army said.
Netanyahu has said troops ""are holding the northern Gaza Strip"" and also the southern city of Khan Yunis, amid heavy fighting.
""We have bisected the Strip and we are preparing to enter Rafah,"" he said Thursday.
Netanyahu is under domestic pressure over his failure to bring home all of the hostages seized by militants on October 7. Israel says about 130 captives remain in Gaza, including 34 presumed dead.
About 200 militants have been killed during the latest Al-Shifa operation, the military said.
Near Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Yunis, troops carried out ""targeted raids on terrorist infrastructure"", killing dozens in combat backed by air support, the army said Thursday.
Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles have massed around another Khan Yunis health facility, the Nasser Hospital, the Gaza health ministry said.
An analysis of satellite images shows heavily damaged areas around the Nasser and Al-Amal hospitals.
- Deadliest toll  -
Since the Gaza war began, Israel has increased its strikes in Syria, targeting army positions and Iran-backed forces including Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, a key Hamas ally.
A Britain-based war monitor said Israeli air strikes Friday in north Syria killed at least 42 people, six from Hezbollah and 36 Syrian soldiers.
And Israel's military said it killed Ali Abdel Hassan Naim, deputy commander of Hezbollah's rocket unit, in an air strike in south Lebanon Friday.
US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators have tried to secure a truce in Gaza, but those talks had appeared deadlocked more than halfway through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Tensions have risen between Netanyahu and Washington, which provides billions of dollars in military aid but has grown increasingly vocal about the war's impact on civilians.On Thursday, Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas approved the new government of prime minister Mohammed Mustafa, who said his cabinet will work on ""visions to reunify the institutions, including assuming responsibility for Gaza"".
Hamas forcibly took Gaza from Abbas's government in 2007.
Netanyahu says Israel must have ""security responsibility"" in Gaza, and has rejected calls for a Palestinian state.

Blinken visits Egypt on tour to seek 'enduring end' to Gaza war,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Egypt on Tuesday as part of his latest Middle East crisis tour, seeking a new ceasefire and ""an enduring end"" to the Israel-Hamas war.  
Heavy strikes and fighting in Gaza killed at least 107 people in the past 24 hours, said the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory that has been under almost four months of bombardment.
Fears grew for more than a million Palestinians crowded into the far southern Rafah area as the battlefront draws ever closer in Israel's campaign to eradicate Hamas over the October 7 attack.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned on Monday that the military ""will reach places where we have not yet fought... right up to the last Hamas bastion, which is Rafah"", on the Egyptian border.Palestinian Raed al-Bardani, 32, who has been displaced multiple times and now lives in Rafah with his wife and their four children, charged that ""the goal is to destroy Rafah because it is the only area that the occupation has not yet destroyed"". 
""Where will we go if they storm Rafah?"" he asked. ""Israel will only stop when they have annihilated the people of Gaza."" 
Blinken -- on his fifth regional tour since the bloodiest ever Gaza war broke out -- met Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a day after he held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh. 
The US top envoy then left for Qatar and was later to head to Israel, hoping to shore up support for a truce deal that was hashed out in Paris in January but has not yet been signed off on by either Hamas or Israel.
Israeli troops, with air and naval support, have been engaged in heavy combat centred on Gaza's main southern city of Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas's Gaza chief, Yahya Sinwar, much of which has been reduced to rubble.Israel accuses Sinwar of masterminding the October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also seized around 250 hostages. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza including 28 who are believed to have been killed.
Israel's withering military campaign has killed at least 27,585 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.
 
- 'No place is safe' -
 The army said Tuesday that ""over the past day, dozens of terrorists have been killed and approximately 80 individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity have been apprehended, including a number of terrorists that took part in the October 7 massacre"".   
It added that army snipers had killed more than 15 militants, and that a naval vessel had fired missiles at a ""terrorist cell"".
An AFP journalist said overnight strikes rocked Khan Yunis and that two air strikes also struck Rafah.""No place is safe, no place at all -- where shall we go?"" one Palestinian, Mohamad Kozaat, said after six members of his family, including his daughter, were wounded in an Israeli strike on the border town.
The United States has strongly backed its top regional ally Israel with munitions and diplomatic support, but also urged steps to reduce civilian casualties and to eventually move toward a two-state solution with the Palestinians.
The truce Blinken is hoping to seal proposes a six-week pause to fighting as Hamas frees hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and more aid enters Gaza, according to a Hamas source.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has faced divisions within his cabinet and public fury over the fate of the remaining hostages, said Israel ""will not accept"" demands Hamas has made for an exchange involving thousands of prisoners.
The premier's right-wing Likud party quoted him as saying the terms ""should be similar to the previous agreement"" in late November, which saw a more limited ratio of Palestinian prisoners exchanged for captives.
 
- Huthi attacks -
 As the Gaza war has raged, violence has flared in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, where Iran-backed groups have launched attacks in support of Hamas, triggering counterattacks by Israel and the United States and its partners.
Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot, on a visit to Iraq, recalled that US President Joe Biden had ""made it clear not to seek further escalation, and that is crucial. I call on all actors to do the same.""
The Israeli army said strikes from Lebanon lightly wounded two soldiers and that it retaliated with artillery ""and struck the sources of the fire"". Its fighter jets had also targeted Hezbollah bases near Marwahin and Meiss El Jabal in southern Lebanon. Yemen's Iran-backed Huthis have for weeks been targeting what they say are Israel-linked ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in solidarity with Palestinians. 
The attacks have disrupted global trade and prompted reprisals by US and British forces, including strikes on two ""explosive-laden drone boats"" on Monday, according to the US military.
The Huthis said Tuesday they had struck US and British ships in two separate attacks, one of which was confirmed by a security firm.Huthi spokesman Yahya Saree said the ""the first attack targeted the American ship Star Nasia, while the other targeted the British ship Morning Tide"". 
Blinken spoke with the Saudi crown prince about ""regional coordination to achieve an enduring end to the crisis in Gaza"" and ""the urgent need to reduce regional tensions"", State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.
Netanyahu said on Monday that ""a complete victory will deal a fatal blow"" not just to Hamas but also to other Iran-backed militant groups across the region.",Tuesday 06 February 2024 - 15:10pm
"Hopes rise for Israel-Hamas truce deal as Gaza toll hits 20,000","GAZA - Hopes rose Wednesday that Israel and Hamas may be inching toward another truce and hostage-release deal in the Gaza war, following talks in Europe and a visit to Egypt by the head of the Palestinian militant group.
While some talked of a truce, fighting raged and Gaza's Hamas government said the death toll in the Palestinian territory reached 20,000.
Right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there can be no Gaza ceasefire until Hamas militants are destroyed, but the White House expressed hope that the truce talks can bring results.
""These are very serious discussions and negotiations and we hope that they lead somewhere,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
His comments came shortly after Netanyahu, under pressure from Washington and other allies over civilian casualties, reiterated his goal of destroying Hamas and said there will be no ceasefire until that is accomplished.
""We won't stop fighting until we've achieved all the objectives we've set ourselves: the elimination of Hamas, the release of our hostages and the end of the threat from Gaza,"" Netanyahu repeated.Late Tuesday he had told relatives of some of the remaining 129 captives held in Gaza that his spy chief was working on efforts to free them.
He said he had ""just sent the head of Mossad to Europe twice to promote a process to free our hostages"".
The bloodiest-ever Gaza war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
In response, Israel began a relentless bombardment alongside a ground invasion. Hamas authorities say most of those killed in Gaza have been women and children.
 
- Protests -
 
Netanyahu has faced protests from hostage relatives seeking an urgent deal to free the captives.
""Every moment the hostages are there, is danger. They have no time,"" Ofir Engel, 17, a Dutch-Israeli former captive, said at a press conference.Talks were ongoing ""with the aim of reaching an agreement around the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza in exchange for a truce and the potential release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons,"" said the source.
Qatar, backed by Egypt and the United States, last month helped broker a first week-long truce in which 80 Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.The Qatar-based chief of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, on Wednesday arrived in Egypt for talks with intelligence chief Abbas Kamel.
A Hamas official, speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity, told AFP in Gaza that ""a total ceasefire and a retreat of the Israeli occupation army from the Gaza Strip are a precondition for any serious negotiation"" on a hostage-prisoner swap.
A source close to Hamas earlier said the Egypt talks would focus on proposals including a week-long truce that would see the release of 40 Israeli hostages.
Before leaving Qatar, Haniyeh met Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian but no details were released.In Rafah, where fireballs and black smoke rose after explosions, residents expressed hope that talks would succeed.
""I wish for a complete ceasefire, and to put an end to the series of death and suffering. It's been more than 75 days,"" said Kassem Shurrab, 25.
Bassil Khoder, 63, said a ceasefire would allow displaced Palestinians like him to return home but it would also be good for Israelis. ""The Jews are also our neighbours,"" he said. ""We won't give up on them.""
 
- 'Enough' -
 
An AFPTV live camera on Wednesday filmed two bombs hitting Rafah, in southern Gaza where many of the territory's estimated 1.9 million displaced have fled.
The Hamas health ministry said Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians when houses and a mosque in Rafah ""were targeted"".Crowds swarmed the rubble, digging with shovels and a backhoe to try to free the victims. One body, blackened and open-mouthed, lay under a bright blue blanket on the blood-soaked ground.
""Enough, enough of this. We have lost everything and we can't take it anymore,"" Samar Abu Luli, a woman in Rafah, said after Israeli strikes on the city's Al-Shabura neighbourhood.
The Israeli army reported close-quarter combat and more than 300 strikes over the past day, while the death toll among its own forces rose to 134 inside Gaza.
It said ""ground, aerial and naval operations were carried out on dozens"" of militants and their infrastructure including rocket launch sites and military command and control centres in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza.
They also found underground infrastructure ""with water and electricity systems"" during a raid on residences of senior Hamas figures in Khan Yunis, the military said.The United Nations Security Council was due to vote Wednesday on a much-delayed resolution calling for a pause to the war after members wrangled over wording.
The latest version of the text seen by AFP calls for the ""urgent suspension"" of hostilities.
The United States vetoed a previous ceasefire resolution.
Israel, which declared a total siege on Gaza at the start of the war, has since allowed in aid trucks through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and, as of this week, its own Kerem Shalom crossing.
The UN's World Food Progamme said Wednesday it had delivered food through Kerem Shalom in a first direct aid convoy from Jordan as ""millions face the risk of starvation"".
Fuel, water and medical supplies are also scarce, diseases are spreading, and communications have been repeatedly cut.An Israeli military agency, COGAT, said it had started laying a pipeline from Egypt to deliver drinking water from a mobile desalination plant in a project led by the United Arab Emirates.
Visiting nearby Cyprus on Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen expressed support for plans to send humanitarian aid to Gaza from the Mediterranean island.
""We aim to create a fast track for humanitarian aid to Gaza through this corridor,"" he told reporters.
The Gaza war has sparked fears of regional escalation, with exchanges of fire over the Lebanon border, and missiles from Iran-backed Yemeni rebels disrupting Red Sea shipping.

"Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital a 'death zone', WHO says urging evacuation","GAZA - Gaza's largest hospital has become a ""death zone,"" the World Health Organization said Sunday, announcing plans to evacuate the facility, as Israel's army said it was expanding operations to destroy Hamas.
The assessment came after a visit by WHO and other UN officials to the hospital, which Israeli troops raided earlier this week.
Elsewhere, a Hamas health official said more than 80 people were killed Saturday in twin strikes on a northern Gaza refugee camp, including on a UN school sheltering displaced people.
Social media videos verified by AFP showed bodies covered in blood and dust on the floor of a building where mattresses had been wedged under school tables, in Jabalia, the Palestinian territory's biggest refugee camp.
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, described ""horrifying images"" from the incident, while Egypt called the bombing a ""war crime"" and ""a deliberate insult to the United Nations"".A separate strike Saturday on another building in Jabalia camp killed 32 people from the same family, 19 of them children, Hamas health authorities said. 
Without mentioning the strikes, the Israeli army said ""an incident in the Jabalia region"" was under review.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the October 7 attacks, which Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and saw about 240 people taken hostage.
The army's relentless air and ground campaign has since killed 12,300 people, more than 5,000 of them children, according to the Hamas government, which has ruled Gaza since 2007.
The UN says some 1.6 million people have been displaced inside the Gaza Strip by six weeks of fighting, and Israel said Saturday its military was now ""expanding its operational activities in additional neighbourhoods in the area of the Gaza Strip"".
 
- 'Extreme suffering' -
 Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has been a key focus in recent days, with Israeli forces alleging Hamas uses it as a command centre -- a claim denied by the group and medical staff.
On Sunday, the WHO described the hospital as a ""death zone"", with a mass grave at the entrance and nearly 300 patients left inside with 25 health workers.
It said it was planning ""the immediate evacuation of the remaining patients, staff and their families"", warning, however, that nearby facilities were already overstretched and urging an immediate ceasefire given the ""extreme suffering of the people of Gaza"".
On Saturday, hundreds of people fled the hospital on foot on orders from the Israeli army, according to the facility's director.Columns of sick and injured -- some of them amputees -- were seen leaving with displaced people, doctors, and nurses, as loud explosions were heard around the complex.
At least 15 bodies, some in advanced stages of decomposition, were strewn along the route, lined with heavily damaged shops and overturned vehicles, an AFP journalist there said.
NGO Doctors without Borders said a convoy carrying its staff and family members came under attack Saturday while evacuating from near Al-Shifa, despite coordinating with both sides. One person was killed.
Israeli forces denied ordering the evacuation of the hospital, saying it had ""acceded to the request of the director"" to allow more civilians to leave.
The WHO said 29 patients at the hospital with serious spinal injuries cannot move without medical assistance, and others have infected wounds due to lack of antibiotics.
There are also 32 babies in ""extremely critical condition,"" WHO said.
 
- 'Not normal' -
 Israel's siege on Gaza has left food, water, medicine and fuel in short supply, with just a trickle of aid allowed in from Egypt.
Under US pressure, Israel permitted a first consignment of fuel to enter late Friday, allowing telecommunications to resume after a two-day blackout.
The UN said Israel had agreed to allow in 60,000 litres (16,000 gallons) of fuel a day from Saturday, but warned it only around a third of what is needed.
Israel has told Palestinians to move south for their safety, but deadly strikes continued there too. At least 26 people were killed in a residential building on Saturday, according to the director of the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis.
Diplomacy to secure the release of hostages is continuing, with a US official saying more fuel deliveries and a ""significant pause"" in fighting would come ""when hostages are released"".
The White House denied, however, a Washington Post report of a tentative agreement, with National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson saying ""we continue to work hard to get to a deal"".Relatives of those taken, who range from infants to octogenarians, piled pressure on Israel's government Saturday after arriving outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Jerusalem office on a march from Tel Aviv.
""It's not normal to have children kidnapped for 43 days. We don't know what the government is doing, we don't have any information,"" said marcher Ari Levi. 
The bodies of two female hostages were recovered in Gaza this week, the Israeli military said, while four abductees have so far been released.
Gaza's fate after the conflict remains unclear, and Biden argued in an opinion piece published Saturday that the coastal territory and the Israeli-occupied West Bank should come under a single ""revitalised"" administration.
""As we strive for peace, Gaza and the West Bank should be reunited under a single governance structure, ultimately under a revitalised Palestinian Authority,"" he wrote in the Washington Post.
However, Netanyahu has insisted the Palestinian Authority ""in its current form is not capable of receiving responsibility for Gaza"".
Biden also threatened sanctions, including visa bans, against settlers who have ramped up attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank in recent weeks.",Sunday 19 November 2023 - 06:30am
Ground battles rage in Gaza as concern grows for hospitals,"GAZA - Israeli ground forces fought deadly battles with Hamas militants inside Gaza on Monday and sent tanks to the outskirts of the biggest city while air strikes kept raining down on the besieged Palestinian territory.
The intensifying military campaign since the October 7 Hamas attacks has sharply heightened fears for the 2.4 million civilians trapped inside Gaza, where the Hamas-controlled health ministry says more than 8,300 have died.
Concern has surged about the widening humanitarian crisis and the fate of hospitals in the war zone where, the World Health Organisation warns, many patients cannot be safely moved despite Israel's evacuation order.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to eradicate Hamas after its gunmen killed 1,400 people and took more than 230 hostages, according to the latest Israeli figures, in the worst attack in the country's history.
The attack set off the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, marked by weeks of withering aerial bombardment and three continuous nights of ground operations centred on northern Gaza, which Israel has told civilians to evacuate.
In heavy clashes overnight, the Israeli army said it had killed dozens of militants hiding ""inside buildings and tunnels"", and a fighter jet struck a building ""with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside"".Columns of Israeli tanks and armoured bulldozers were seen churning through the sand, and Israeli snipers took positions inside emptied residential buildings, in footage released by the army.
Dozens of Israeli tanks advanced for more than an hour into the southern fringes of Gaza City and blocked the main north-south highway, ""firing at any vehicle that tries to go along it"", an eyewitness told AFP by phone.
Air strikes also cratered the road and brought down buildings, residents said, before the tanks pulled back from the area.
- 'Cruel psychological propaganda' -
The Israeli land forces were supported by heavy fire from fighter jets, drones and artillery that the army said had struck more than 600 targets within 24 hours, up sharply from 450 a day earlier.Hamas said it had fired anti-tank missiles at two Israeli armoured vehicles.
It also charged Israel was trying to present a ""false image that its soldiers are present in the Gaza Strip interior, even though blows delivered by the resistance have prevented them"".
Hamas also released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall, although the time and place of the recording could not be verified.
One woman was heard calling in an agitated tone for Netanyahu to agree to Hamas' proposed exchange of the hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
Netanyahu decried the clip as ""cruel psychological propaganda"", in a statement issued shortly afterwards. He named them as Yelena Trupanob, Daniel Aloni and Rimon Kirsht, and vowed ""to bring all the abducted and missing people home"".
The more than 230 hostages -- aged between a few months and above 80 -- are believed to be held in a giant network of underground tunnels where Hamas has hid its military infrastructure from Israeli surveillance and air attacks.""Our hearts are broken,"" it wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Shani who was kidnapped from a music festival and tortured and paraded around Gaza by Hamas terrorists, experienced unfathomable horrors. May her memory be a blessing.""
- Spiralling crisis -
Fear and desperation have spiralled in Gaza, under weeks of siege that have cut off water, food, fuel and other essentials to the long-blockaded territory.The United Nations reported Sunday that civil order was starting to break down after ""thousands of people"" ransacked its warehouses looking for tinned food, flour, oil and hygiene supplies.
Donkey carts were lining up to load water, as safe drinking water has become scarce, in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip.
According to the UN, all 10 hospitals in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders -- despite sheltering thousands of patients and about 117,000 of the displaced.
Among those being treated are intensive care patients, infants and elderly people on life support systems.The head of the World Health Organization said calls to evacuate Al-Quds hospital in Gaza City were ""deeply concerning"".
""We reiterate -- it's impossible to evacuate hospitals full of patients without endangering their lives,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X.
Mohamed al-Talmas, who has taken shelter in Gaza's biggest hospital Al-Shifa, said ""the ground shook"" there with intense Israeli raids.
Israel describes Al-Shifa hospital as a de facto Hamas ""command centre"" and headquarters.
- 'Collective punishment' -
UN chief Antonio Guterres has warned the situation in Gaza is getting ""more desperate by the hour"" and warned against the ""collective punishment"" of Palestinians.US President Joe Biden stressed to Netanyahu that, while Israel has the right to defend itself, it must do so ""in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law that prioritises the protection of civilians"".
Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron earlier ""stressed the importance of getting urgent humanitarian support"" into Gaza.
Limited aid has entered Gaza from Egypt under a US-brokered deal, but its volume, 117 trucks so far, has fallen far short of the hundreds of trucks a day aid agencies say are needed.
Anti-Israel anger has flared across the region and beyond.In Russia's Muslim-majority Dagestan, police said they had arrested 60 people after on Sunday a crowd stormed an airport to attack Jewish passengers coming from Tel Aviv.
Washington has warned Israel's enemies -- in particular Iran-allied ""axis of resistance"" groups -- not to become more fully involved after a series of attacks across the Middle East.
The Israeli army has traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon and struck targets in Syria, including on Monday when it said it was responding to launches ""toward Israeli territory"".
Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, told AFP that ""I am doing my duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war"".Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank where health officials say about 120 Palestinians have been killed since the Gaza war started.
Germany on Monday called on Israel to protect Palestinians in the West Bank from attacks by ""extremist"" Israeli settlers.
In annexed east Jerusalem on Monday, police said a knife-wielding Palestinian stabbed and seriously wounded an Israeli police officer before the attacker was shot dead.

Israel denies deadly strike on Gaza hospital,"TEL AVIV - The Israeli army said it had ""evidence"" that militants were responsible for the blast that killed hundreds at a Gaza hospital, saying a review proved others were at fault.
""The evidence — which we are sharing with you all — confirms that the explosion at the hospital in Gaza was caused by an Islamic Jihad rocket that misfired,"" military spokesman Daniel Hagari told a press conference in Tel Aviv.
Health officials in the impoverished enclave said the blast killed at least 200 people.
Israel and Palestinian militants have traded blame for the explosion, which has sparked global condemnation and violent protests in several Muslim nations.
Health authorities in Hamas-controlled Gaza said the blast at the Ahli Arab Hospital killed between 200 and 300 people and was caused by the latest in a wave of Israeli airstrikes. Hamas said in a statement 500 had died.
Israeli Defense Forces blamed Palestinian militants, saying an outgoing Islamic Jihad rocket misfired.

UN assembly moves past Security Council to take lead on Gaza,"NEW YORK - The UN General Assembly was due to vote Tuesday on a non-binding resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza -- a call that the paralyzed Security Council has so far failed to make.
The United States, one of only five permanent members of the Security Council, used its veto on Friday to halt a draft text calling for a ceasefire, the latest sign of impasse.
The Council took more than a month after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas militants to speak out, and it did so with a weak voice, calling in mid-November after four rejected texts for humanitarian ""pauses"" in the conflict.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned of a looming ""complete breakdown of public order"" in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Many countries and human rights organizations deplored last Friday's Security Council failure, and Guterres on Sunday described the Council's authority and credibility as ""undermined.""
Israeli air and land attacks continue to pummel Gaza, more than two months after the bloody and unprecedented attack perpetrated by Hamas fighters on Israeli soil on October 7.
Some 1,200 Israelis were killed in the initial attack, while the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 18,205 Palestinians have died in Israel's bombardment since. 
The UN itself is mourning the death of more than 100 of its own aid workers since the onset of war.
""We need to stop this war. And we need to stop it now,"" Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour said Tuesday, adding that Palestinians are justifiably outraged.  
""At the end of the day, we believe we will prevail with almost the entire international community in calling for a humanitarian ceasefire,"" Mansour said.
 
- 'Catastrophic' -
 
In order to build pressure, Arab countries called for the new special session of the General Assembly for Tuesday afternoon, just after a visit to the Rafah border point by more than a dozen Security Council ambassadors.
The draft text, seen by AFP, largely reproduces the resolution blocked in the Council on Friday by the United States.
Expressing concern at the ""catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip,"" it ""demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,"" and calls for the protection of civilians, humanitarian access, and the ""immediate and unconditional"" release of all hostages.
But like a text adopted by the Assembly at the end of October -- which called for an ""immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities"" -- it does not condemn Hamas, an absence systematically criticized by Israel and the United States.
The US delegation has proposed an amendment which condemns ""the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas"" on October 7. A similar amendment to the resolution passed in late October was rejected.
Another amendment, proposed by Austria, states that hostages held in Gaza are ""held by Hamas and other groups,"" the key point again being to name the militant organization explicitly.
The previous resolution received 120 votes in favor, 14 against (including Israel and the United States) and 45 abstentions.
With calls for a ceasefire multiplying, ""it is safe to assume that the majority will be greater"" this time, Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group told AFP.
This may bring the Assembly closer to the 140 or so countries (out of 193 member states) that have repeatedly denounced the invasion of Ukraine, a result that the United States has cited as proof of Russia's isolation.
But even with overwhelming support for a non-binding text, ""nobody imagines that the General Assembly can persuade Israel to cease fire, just as it cannot order Putin to quit Ukraine.  The goal is to make the US increasingly nervous,"" Gowan said.
Although the Security Council is ""at the heart of our work in peace and security,"" said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general, messages from the General Assembly ""are also very important.""

Israel-Hamas battles create havoc in Gaza hospitals,"GAZA CITY - Heavy fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas trapped thousands of people in Gaza's hospitals on Sunday, with medics and aid workers warning patients will die in the crippled facilities unless there is a pause in the battle.
Bright flares lit up the night sky over Gaza City and blasts echoed across the city, AFP television images showed, as Israel's air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas brought the fight to key medical installations.
""If we do not stop this bloodshed immediately with a ceasefire or at the bare minimum a medical evacuation of patients, these hospitals will become a morgue,"" medical aid group Doctors Without Borders warned Sunday.
READ: Palestinians say deadly strike hit Gaza hospital
Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the biggest in the territory, is ""totally surrounded and bombardments are going on nearby"", said the hospital's director, Mohammad Abu Salmiya.
""The medical team cannot work and the bodies, in their dozens, cannot be managed or buried,"" he said. 
The UN's World Health Organization expressed alarm at the situation in Al-Shifa.

""WHO is gravely concerned about the safety of health workers, hundreds of sick and injured patients, including babies on life support, and displaced people who remain inside the hospital,"" director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.
The Israeli military has denied strikes or a siege at Al-Shifa hospital, and has repeatedly accused Hamas of using medical facilities as command centres and hideouts.
Hames has denied the accusations.",Sunday 12 November 2023 - 09:30am
"Israel and Hamas agree truce, release of 50 hostages","Israel and Hamas announced a deal on Wednesday allowing at least 50 hostages and scores of Palestinian prisoners to be freed while offering besieged Gaza residents a four-day truce after weeks of all-out war.
In the first major diplomatic breakthrough in the bloodiest ever Gaza war, Palestinian militants are set to release 50 women and children kidnapped during their deadly October 7 raids into southern Israel.
""We are very happy that a partial release is pending,"" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum group said in a statement. ""As of now, we don't know exactly who will be released when.""
After weeks of Qatar-brokered negotiations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet approved the truce accord at the end of an almost all-night meeting, with the premier telling ministers this was a ""difficult decision but it's a right decision"".
The cabinet's sign-off was one of the last stumbling blocks after what one US official described as five ""extremely excruciating"" weeks of talks. Hamas welcomed the ""humanitarian truce"" and said it would see 150 Palestinians released from Israeli jails.
""The resistance is committed to the truce as long as the occupation honours it,"" a Hamas official told AFP.
The war started after Hamas gunmen on October 7 launched the worst attack in Israel's history that left around 1,200 people dead, most of them civilians, according to the Israeli government.
Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups also took an estimated 240 Israelis and foreigners hostage, among them elderly people and young children.
Israel declared war on Hamas, vowing to bring the hostages home and to destroy the militant group. It launched a major bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza, which, according to the Hamas government, has killed 14,100 people, thousands of them children.
Israel said that to facilitate the hostage release it would initiate a four-day ""pause"" in its air, land and sea assault of Gaza, while it stressed that the agreement did not spell the end of the war.
For every 10 additional hostages released, there would be an extra day's ""pause"", the Israeli government said.
- 'Brave souls' -
Sources from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad group had earlier told AFP the truce would include a ceasefire on the ground and a pause in Israeli air operations over southern Gaza.A senior US official said three Americans, including three-year-old Abigail Mor Idan, were among the 50 earmarked for staggered release from Thursday.
US President Joe Biden said he was ""extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls... will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented"".Qatar's foreign ministry confirmed the deal, saying that ""a number of Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons"" would be released in exchange for the hostages.
""The starting time of the pause will be announced within the next 24 hours and last for four days, subject to extension,"" the ministry said.
Families grappled with a lack of clarity over who would be released and when. 
""We don't know who will get out because Hamas will release the names every evening of those who will get out the next day,"" said Gilad Korngold, whose son and daughter-in-law are being held in Gaza along with their two children and other relatives. 
Israel released the names of 300 Palestinian prisoners being considered for release, without specifying who might be freed in the first phase. 
""We don't know who will be freed first, and that's a problem for us in responding to the families,"" said Amani Sarahneh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group.
Among the Palestinians slated for release is Shrouq Dwayyat, convicted of attempted murder in a 2015 knife attack.
Her mother Sameera Dwayyat told AFP she had ""mixed feelings"" about the news. ""I had hoped that she would come out in a deal,"" she said, though she added that her relief was tempered by ""great pain in my heart"" over the dead children in Gaza.
The deal was welcomed by countries including Britain, China, France, Germany, Jordan and Egypt, where the office of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi touted the ""success"" of mediation by Cairo, Doha and Washington.
The Palestinian Authority also hailed the agreement while reiterating its call for ""a comprehensive cessation of the Israeli aggression"" and more aid deliveries, senior official Hussein al-Sheikh wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
- Misgivings -Hardline Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir signalled he would vote against the agreement, saying it should include the release of Israeli soldiers also taken by Hamas.
But with dozens of families in Israel who are desperate to have their loved ones returned home, and the Israeli public gripped by the hostages' fate, the government ultimately set aside any misgivings.Israel's hawkish Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said before the crunch meeting that he had won assurances that the deal would not spell the end of the war.
""Immediately after we have exhausted this phase"", security operations would ""continue in full force"", he said. 
The government underscored that Israel ""will continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza"".
- 'Unbearable situation' -Earlier, Gaza resident Hamza Abdel Razeq said he would welcome any ceasefire agreement, hoping it would bring some respite.
""The people are really suffering,"" he told AFP. ""I believe it will pave the way for longer truces or even a total ceasefire.""
A US official said there was also hope that the deal would lead to a ""full pause"" in deadly exchanges of fire along the Israel-Lebanon border with Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran.
Large parts of Gaza have been flattened by thousands of air strikes, and the territory faces shortages of food, water and fuel.
Israel appeared to continue its offensive in northern Gaza Wednesday, with witnesses reporting dawn strikes on Kamal Adwan hospital and nearby homes. A casualty toll was not immediately available.Medical workers treated bloodied, dust-covered survivors as other residents fled through debris-strewn streets to safety.
Israel says Hamas uses medical facilities to hide fighters and as bases for operations, making them legitimate military objectives while insisting it does everything possible to limit harm to civilians.
