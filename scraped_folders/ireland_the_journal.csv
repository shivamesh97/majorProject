"Shifting sands 
 The people of the West Bank are stuck in hellish game they never agreed to play","Reporter Hannah McCarthy, based in Beirut, has been visiting the West Bank for weeks since the latest conflict between Israel and Hamas began last year.
She has documented the lives of communities in shock, suffering huge upheaval in the conflict and often daily terror by settlers in the area. Here, Hannah looks at the geography and history in the area, giving some insights into how its places and people have changed over decades, through the prism of an old board game…
WHILE I WAS reporting on the Israel-Hamas war, I came across an old Monopoly board based on Palestine in 1941. Here are some of my takeaways:
Jewish Quarter
Located on a narrow winding cobblestone street in Jerusalem’s old city is theOld Yishuv Court Museum. The small museum is filled with old household objects replicating life for a Jewish family before the Jordanian occupation in 1948 led tothe expulsion of the small community of Jewish residentsliving inside the old city’s walls.
In one of the rooms is an English and Hebrew language version of the boardgame Concern (Monopoly to us in Ireland) which according to the museum curator was devised in the early 1940s, at a time when World War Two raged and Palestine was still occupied and administered by the British authorities.
Concern Board.
With Monopoly not available in Hebrew or for British Mandate Palestine,Benjamin Barlevi, a Polish Jew who emigrated to Israel in the 1920s devised a special version of Monopoly that was first released in 1941 as ‘Concern’.
Believed to have held right-leaning views and a knowledge of biblical geography, Barlevi was keen to pass on his interests to the next generation through board games. As many Irish readers will likely know, the aim ofMonopolyis for each player to become the wealthiest by buying, trading and collecting rent on properties. Meanwhile, opponents are slowly forced into bankruptcy and eliminated from the game. Perhaps many recall family bust-ups following an evening of Monopoly — it’s not a template for peaceful co-existence.
Gaza featured as one of the properties on the Concern board.
The antique Concern board serves both as a time capsule forBritish Mandate Palestineand the vision of many early 20th century Zionists. The most expensive properties on the board are the coastal towns (now cities) of Tel Aviv (400 Shekels), Jaffa (200 Shekels) and Haifa (300 Shekels) while the cheapest are the Negev properties of Gaza (80 Shekels) and Beersheba (120 Shekels).
Gaza has long been poorer than Tel Aviv but the disparities are even more glaring today as the besieged Palestinian enclavefaces mass famineand disease just miles away from the high-tech Israeli hub.
The important religious cities of Jerusalem (380 Shekels), Bethlehem (250 Shekels) and Hebron (180 Shekels) are grouped together asJudea, a biblical term still used by religious settlers who occupy parts of Jerusalem and Hebron today.

Metula (250 Shekels) along the Israeli northern border with Lebanon was one of the more expensive properties in 1941, before aneffectively closed land borderwas imposed after Israel’s establishment in 1948 and the mass arrival of Palestinian refugees that has destabilised the fragile Lebanese state to this day.

Meanwhile,Metula today is almost a ghost town after Israeli residents were evacuated at the start of the war, as the militant group Hezbollah which controls southern Lebanon and Israeli forces began trading almost daily rocket fire.
Ramallah
The 1941 Concern board doesn’t feature Ramallah which has since become the base forthe Palestinian eliteandthe weak and corrupt Palestinian Authoritydevised by the Oslo Accords in the 1990s to administer parts of the West Bank while Israel maintains control over the majority of the territory.
Nor does the gameboard featureillegal Israeli settlements such as Ariel, which have grown into small, well-guarded Jewish cities in the West Bank thatwill not easily be dismantled to make way for any future Palestinian state.
Ariel
New Israeli cities such as Modiin and Rehovot have sprung up since the Concern board was devised. Meanwhile,no new Arab towns or cities have been builtwithin Israel’s official border for Palestinian citizens of Israel who have limited options for places to live in the Jewish state.
Unsurprisingly, the game of Monopoly was first popularised in the US, a laboratory for market capitalism and real estate speculation. Most right-wing settlers in the West Bank, however, have not had to reckon with a truly free market to buy their properties or develop their businesses.
Instead manyreceive large subsidies and cheap mortgagesto live comfortably in the occupied Palestinian territories. Even Ireland has had a role to play in the economic bolstering of illegal settlement activity in the West Bank: last year, it was revealed thatover four million euro of Irish state funds had been invested in nine Israeli businesses operating in the occupied West Bank– a situation which the government has said they are working to resolve.
The new financial and travel sanctions imposed by the US and the UK (but not the EU) on extremist and violent settlers in the West Bank could impact the flow of cheap money to the illegal settlement particularly because ofhow interwoven Israeli and US banksare but the economic support for settlers in the West Bank provides them with a significant advantage over neighbouring Palestinians,who earn around 8 percent of what the average Israeli earns.

The Palestinian city of Nablus (250 Shekels) in the northern West Bank was a desirable property for those playing the old version of Concern but decades of Israeli military occupationhas stalled the largest Palestinian city’s economic developmentcompared with the cities that stand inside Israel’s 1948 borders.
Even attracting business from fellow Palestinians living in Israel or elsewhere in the West Bank has been difficult for businesses in Nablusamidst onerous Israeli military restrictions in place since 7 October.

Last month, I spoke with a server at a tastefully decorated new pizza restaurant that had opened in the old city of Nablus just before the war began and which was now struggling to survive as the main roads out of the Palestinian city with 160,000 residents had been closed.
The three hours I later spent at the military checkpoint which controlled access to one of the only roads out of Nablus that was open certainly made me think twice about a return journey anytime soon.

In the historic Palestinian city of Jenin (180 Shekels), I spoke with Yousef Awad who received support from both the Swedish and Israeli government after the Oslo Accords to study in Sweden to become a tour guide in Jenin.

Butfrequent military raids on the refugee campin the eastern part of Jenin havemade foreign tourism a difficult sell for even those with an appetite for risk and adventure, while most stores in the city’s once bustling old city are shuttered.

At the cultural centre Awad owns in Jenin are pictures from the 90s and early 2000s of groups of Israeli and Palestinian children on trips to Washington DC when cross-community projects happened, similar to many which happen regularly today in Northern Ireland.
Last March, I asked a community leader atBurj al Luq Luq, a Palestinian community centre in Jerusalem’s old city if the centre ever organised games with the local Israeli children. The Palestinian man responded angrily: “No, and we wouldn’t want to organise those types of matches. I know that’s not the answer you want but this isn’t a Hollywood film.”
More Palestinians werekilled in the first two weeks of the latest war on Gazathan were killedin the entirety of The Troubles. The experiences of Palestine and Northern Ireland are increasingly incomparable, as the former experiences a violent escalation and death toll that eclipses anything ever experienced by the latter.
It is perhaps inevitable that an American game like Monopoly would feature jail time. On the Concern board in the old Yishuv Court Museum, I noticed that instead of a ‘Go to Jail’ square in the corner, there was a square offering passage to neighbouring Egypt.

Today, the mass forced displacement of Palestinians to Egypt increasinglyappears in mainstream public discoursein Israel, although often described as “voluntary migration”.
As Israel announces plans to extend its military operations to Rafah and talk of Israeli settlements in Gaza grows, Egypthas bolstered the number of walls and checkpoints around its borderwith the war-torn Palestinian enclave over fears that Israel will use the war as an opportunity to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee into Egypt.
The separation wall in Bethlehem.
The US has said it is opposed to the mass displacement of Palestinians and that Israeli military operations in southern Gaza have “gone too far,” yetAmerican weapons continue to flow to Israel. As top EU diplomat Josep Borrellsaid this week: “If you believe that too many people are being killed, maybe you should provide less arms in order to prevent so many people being killed.”
Meanwhile, the lives of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the West Bank remain subject to the rules of a hellish game that they never agreed to play.

US urges Israel not to carry out Rafah attack in Gaza without plan to keep civilians safe,"
ISRAEL IS FACING renewed calls from key ally the United States against launching a large-scale attack on Gaza’s southern city of Rafah.
Around 1.5 million Palestinians are trapped in Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted he would push ahead with a “powerful” operation in the overcrowded city to achieve “complete victory” over the Hamas militant group.
The White House said US President Joe Biden had spoken by phone with Netanyahu late yesterday, urging him not to carry out an attack on Rafah without a plan to keep civilians safe.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven into Rafah, seeking shelter in a sprawling makeshift encampment near the Egyptian border.
The city now hosts more than half of Gaza’s population, with displaced people “crammed” into less than 20 percent of the territory, according to UN humanitarian agency OCHA.
“We were displaced from Gaza City to the south,” said Ahlam Abu Assi. “(Then) they told us to go to Rafah, so we went to Rafah.
“We can’t keep going and coming,” she added. “There is no safe place for us.”
Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand have also urged Israel not to launch a ground offensive in the city.
In a letter sent to the European Commission earlier this week by Taoiseach Leo Varadkarand Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez, the pair said an expanded Israeli military operation in Rafah “poses a grave and imminent threat that the international community must urgently confront”.
And during a visit to Dublin,UNRWA’s Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said the situation in Rafah is “deeply concerning” and that citizens have paid a “staggering and disproportionate price”.
He also questioned the ability of UNRWA to operate in Rafah if a ground offensive begins and said there is “no safe place” in the Gaza Strip.

Israeli strikes killed 112 people early today across the Palestinian territory, the Hamas-run health ministry said.
Israel’s army meanwhile reported the death of another soldier in Gaza early today, raising the number of soldiers killed in the ground operation to 233.
Roughly 130 hostages are still believed to be in Gaza after the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas militants, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians.
Dozens of the estimated 250 hostages seized during the attack were freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during a week-long truce in November.
Israel says 30 of those still in Gaza are presumed dead.
At least 28,663 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel’s assault on the Palestinian territory, according to the health ministry.
Israel sent troops into one of the largest medical sites in southern Gaza yesterday, saying its forces were hunting for hostages and carrying out a “precise and limited operation” at the facility.
Intense fighting has been reported in recent days between Israeli forces and Hamas militants around Nasser Hospital– one of the territory’s few operational medical facilities.

Israel, which has accused Hamas militants of using hospitals for military purposes, said it was carrying out a “precise and limited operation” at the facility with “no obligation” for patients or staff to evacuate.
Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said there was “credible intelligence from a number of sources, including released hostages, indicating that Hamas held hostages at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis and that there may be bodies of our hostages” there.
The health ministry in Gaza reported that thousands of people who had sought refuge in the complex, including patients, have been made to leave in recent days.
It has called the situation at Nasser “catastrophic”, with staff unable to move bodies to the morgue because of the risks involved.
Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) described a “chaotic situation” in the hospital after it was shelled early Thursday, killing and wounding multiple people.
“Our medical staff have had to flee the hospital, leaving patients behind,” MSF said, with one employee unaccounted for and another detained by Israeli forces.
The World Health Organization has described Nasser Hospital as a critical facility “for all of Gaza”, where only a minority of hospitals are even partly operational.
The UN Human Rights Office said Israel’s raid on the hospital appeared to be “part of a pattern of attacks by Israeli forces striking essential life-saving civilian infrastructure in Gaza, especially hospitals”.
Mediators from the United States, Qatar and Egypt gathered in Cairo to broker a deal to halt the fighting and see the release of the remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
CIA director Bill Burns made an unannounced visit to Israel yesterday for talks with Netanyahu and the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, David Barnea.
Barnea had already held talks with Burns and Egyptian and Qatari representatives in Cairo on Tuesday, before a Hamas delegation visited Wednesday.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he believed an agreement was still possible.
“We’re very focused on it and I believe it’s possible,” he said on a visit to Albania.

Netanyahu’s office said it had not received “any new proposal” from Hamas about releasing hostages, and Israeli media reported the country’s delegation would not return to negotiations until Hamas had softened its stance.
While he did not comment directly on those reports, Netanyahu said: “I insist that Hamas drop their delusional demands and, when they drop these demands, we can move forward.”
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, who heads the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, has urged Hamas to “rapidly” agree to a truce and stave off further tragedy.
In a post on X late last night, Netanyahu said Israel will not accept “international dictates” regarding a resolution of the conflict with the Palestinians.
Netanyahu said such a resolution can only be the result of negotiations.
He said Israel opposes a unilateral recognition of statehood, claiming it would amount to a “huge reward” for Hamas.
He wrote that “Israel rejects outright international dictates regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians.”

Bernie Sanders says Joe Biden is 'very wrong' on the issue of Israel and Gaza,"US SENATOR BERNIE Sanders has said US President Joe Biden is “very wrong” on the issue of Israel and Gaza.
On Tuesday, the US Senate passed a $95.3 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, pushing ahead after months of difficult negotiations.
The package would include $14 billion for Israel’s offensive on Hamas.
Progressive lawmakers have objected to sending offensive weaponry to Israel, and senator Bernie Sanders, an independent of Vermont, as well as two Democrats, senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Peter Welch of Vermont, voted against it.
When asked by RTÉ Prime Time’s Miriam O’Callaghan about the situation in Gaza and being one of the senators who voted against the package, Sanders said has been “very upset” that Congress is prepared to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government billions to continue to offensive.
He said the conflict is “one of the great humanitarian disasters in modern history” and isn’t ”reported adequately in the United States”.
“About 27,000 people [have] already been killed. Almost 70,000 who have been injured. You’re talking about 1.8 million, 80% of the people displaced,” Sanders said.
“Can you imagine, that’s half the size of Ireland, that half the people just yanked out of their homes, put on the road. They don’t have food, they don’t have water, they don’t have medical supplies, they don’t have fuel,” he said.
“And now, what you’re looking at because of the restrictions on the border, food getting in, plus the bombardments, children by the hundreds of 1000s are starving to death,” Sanders added.

“Who cannot be upset about this?”
Sanders said that Hamas is a “jihadist, disgusting, terrorist organisation” that started the conflict and that “Israel has a right to defend itself”.
However, he added that “it does not have a right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people”.
“So I have been very upset that the United States Congress is prepared to give Netanyahu and his right wing government another $10 billion in order to continue this war. That, to me, is beyond belief,” Sanders said.

Sanders was also asked about his efforts to leverage his influence on the matter of Israel and Gaza with the Biden White House.
He said: “Of course I have, and we’re going to continue to do that”.
“Joe Biden is an old friend of mine. I’ve known him for many years. We’ve worked together on some, I think, very successful projects. Uh, but on this issue, he’s wrong. Very wrong,” Sanders said.

"Israel responds to South African ICJ request for new orders, calling it 'peculiar and improper'","ISRAEL HAS WRITTEN to the International Court of Justice in response to an urgent request made by South Africa this week for the court to impose extra emergency orders on Israel over its conduct in Gaza.
The Israeli legal team has today described South Africa’s latest request as “highly peculiar and improper”.
Therequestwas made on Monday in the context of South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the UN court. South Africa alleges that Israel is in violation of the Genocide Convention in multiple ways through its military campaign in Gaza.
The Court has already issued emergency orders against Israel – known as provisional measures – but this week South Africa’s lawyers argued that more were needed after “a significant development” in the conflict, namely the planned invasion and “evacuation”of the southern Gazan city of Rafah, the last refuge for about 1.5 million displaced people.
The South African request cited a statement from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu which said he had ordered the Israeli military “to submit to the Cabinet a combined plan for evacuating the population and destroying the (Hamas) battalions”.

Given the dire situation faced by people in Rafah, who have been forced to flee areas further north due to the Israeli invasion, South Africa asked the Court to reassess the situation.
Israel, however, has responded todayby asking the Court to reject the South African request, arguing that the situation in Gaza has not changed since it issued provisional orders three weeks ago.
It argued that since the invasion of Rafah has not happened yet, the situation in the conflict cannot be said to have changed.
The Israeli legal team also argued that the request was “highly peculiar and improper” based on a technical reading of the article cited by South Africa, calling the invocation of Article 75 (1) “inapplicable”.
The Israeli response also reiterated its opinion of the broader genocide case against it, calling it “repugnant” and describing it as an abuse of the ICJ and the Genocide Convention.
Israel is due to submit a report to the ICJ next week to update the judges on how it has acted since the provisional measures were ordered.

Tánaiste accuses Israel of ‘disinformation campaign’ against UNRWA as he pledges extra funding,"LAST UPDATE|15 Feb
TÁNAISTE MICHÉAL MARTIN has accused Israel of a “disinformation campaign” against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza as he pledges additional funding for the aid organisation.
Ireland will provide immediate support of an additional €20 million for UNRWA and its work in assisting refugees in Gaza.
Martin, who is also Minister for Foreign Affairs, made the announcement during a visit to Dublin by UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini.
Speaking to the press after their meeting, Martin said sufficient aid is still not reaching civilians in Gaza and accused Israel of launching a disinformation campaign against UNRWA.
He was referring to the recent allegations made by Israel that12 of UNWRA’s staff were directly involvedin Hamas’ 7 October on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed.
Martin said it was “no coincidence” that the allegations emerged in parallel to South Africa’s genocide case against Israel in the International Court of Justice.
Lazzarini said today that no evidence has been provided to supported the claims.
Despite this, the agency has since removed the accused staff.
UNRWA has been the last lifeline for thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gaza over the last few months but has been thrown into chaos after multiple countries, including the US, Germany and the UK suspended funding as a result of Israel’s allegations.
On the additional funding announced today, Martin said it is vital to sustain UNRWA’s work not just in Gaza, but also across the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
Martin also urged other countries to resume and expand support to UNRWA “so that it can deliver for the millions of Palestinian refugees in need”.
Speaking today on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Lazzarini said around 15 countries have frozen funding which has created a shortfall of $450 million (€419m) and that the impact of this will be felt from next month onwards.
Lazzarini said an investigation and review is ongoing of UNRWA’s “risk management processes” and called on countries that have suspended funding to renew this commitment.
He added that part of his meeting with Martin today will revolve around creating a “coalition of countries supporting the agency, because it is under an existential threat”.
Lazzarini noted that “Ireland is a long-standing, strong supporter to the agency both politically and financially.”

He added that theletter sent to the European Commission yesterday by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was “extremely significant” for UNRWA.
In yesterday’s joint letter, Varadkar and Sanchez said UNRWA must be allowed to operate in Gaza and that EU support to UNRWA must be maintained.
“There is no pathway to achieving the urgent massive and sustained scale up in humanitarian assistance, through full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access that is needed, without UNRWA playing a central role,” said the letter.
Meanwhile,Lazzarini added that the situation in Rafah is “deeply concerning” and that citizens have paid a “staggering and disproportionate price”.
He also questioned the ability of UNRWA to operate in Rafah if a ground offensive begins and said there is “no safe place” in the Gaza Strip.
Rafah is the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip and has become the latest target in Israel’s military campaign.
The Israeli army is preparing for a ground incursion into the city along the border with Egypt, where displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from fighting further north.
Around half of Gaza’s 2.3 million population are now refugees in Rafah.
Displaced Palestinians are living in dire conditions, with lack of access to food, water, healthcare and sanitation.
More than 68,200 people have been wounded according to the latest Gaza health ministry toll, and at least 28,576 people, mostly women and children, have been killed during Israel’s assault on the Palestinian territory since 7 October.
Sinn Féin’s Foreign Affairs spokesperson TD Matt Carty welcomed the increased funding that Martin announced today, adding that more should be done by Government to convince international partners to do the same.
Carty said UNWRA is “under attack” and that Israel is has attempted to “undermine” and “dismantle” the organisation.
“Some 30,000 UNRWA employees provide vital services and assistance to Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.”
Carty said the UNRWA workers are the best placed organisation to assist with Palestinians in need of assistance, as Israel continues to shell up and down the region in its retaliatory attack.
He added that Ireland must use “every measure of diplomatic influence” to push back against Israel’s attempt to discredit the aid group and its workers.
“The Irish government must work with all international partners to press for, not just the restoration of funds, but for increased funding for this important lifeline,” Carty said.

"Government needs to show benefit of allowing Israeli Ambassador to stay, says Social Democrats","WELCOME TO POLICY Matters, a series from The Journal that takes a deep dive into the ideas and solutions proposed by Ireland’s politicians on some of the biggest issues of the day.
As part of the series, The Journal sits down with different spokespeople from across Ireland’s political parties to take a deeper look at what they believe needs to be done across key policy areas.
This week, we sat down with the Social Democrats spokesperson on foreign affairs Gary Gannon where the conversation centred on Gaza and Israel.
———
EACH OF THE Social Democrat’s six TDs carry the weight of fairly hefty briefs.
Gannon, a TD for Dublin Central since 2020, acts as the party’s spokesperson on education, higher education, arts, social protection, foreign affairs and defence.
But in the months since Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October, Gannon is probably best known for being the party’s foreign affairs spokesperson.
Since then, Israel and Gaza have dominated his party’s foreign affairs priorities.
And for a small party, the Social Democrats have managed to exert pressure on the Government in a not insignificant way.
That was evident last week when Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told reporters that “a lot of us” in Ireland believe Israel may be in breach of the human rights clause of the EU-Israel trade agreement.
His comments came after months of both Gannon and Social Democrats’ leader Holly Cairns raising the trade agreement in the Dáil and asking the Taoiseach to demand that it be suspended.
This move officially came earlier this week, when the Taoiseach and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchezwrote to European Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyen requesting an urgent review of the trade agreement.
“What the Social Democrats have tried to do is to demonstrate to the Government where we could act,” Gannon toldThe Journal.
Since 7 October, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has stressed that it is better for Ireland to act multilaterally with other partners, particularly the EU, when it comes to Gaza.
Gannon said the Social Democrats fundamentally disagree with this position and believe the Irish Government can show “real leadership” by acting on its own.
He gives the example of calling for the Israeli ambassador Dana Erlich to be expelled from Ireland in protest at the state’s actions in Gaza, something the Government has refused to do despite significant pressure from opposition parties.
The Government has continued to argue that maintaining diplomatic lines to Israel is preferable to severing ties to the Israeli state.
Gannon said the Government should now demonstrate the merits of that decision.
“What has been your engagement with the ambassador in the weeks and months that have followed?
Advertisement
“The Government has been so adamant that keeping those diplomatic lines open is important. But let them show us the proof. Show us what that results have been over the last couple of months,” Gannon said.
In addition to calling for the ambassador to be expelled and for the EU to reexamine the EU-Israel trade agreement, the Social Democrats have also called for Ireland to support South Africa’s genocide case against Israel in the International Court of Justice.
On a domestic level, the party has also called for the Government to progress the Occupied Territories Bill.
“We have a range of measures that if you’re not going to do this, well, then you can do that. I think we’re seeing the fruits of that now,” Gannon said.
In the past few weeks, the Government – and Sinn Féin – havefaced calls to boycottIreland’s annual visit to the Whitehouse on St Patrick’s Day in protest of America’s financial backing of Israel.
People Before Profit in particular has argued that to do so would send an important message of support to Gazans if nothing else.
Where do the Social Democrats fall on the matter?
Gannon said it is a decision for both the Government and Sinn Féin to make on their own.
“If they’re going to go, go. But don’t go and do the doff capping and the begorrah politics. Be assertive and don’t be deferential,” Gannon said.
Gannon added that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar should “lay it out clearly” to the Dáil ahead of the trip, what he plans to say to Joe Biden in relation to Israel and Gaza.
“And the same goes for Sinn Féin, too. If you’re going to go make sure that when you’re speaking to your conservative, Republican donors, that you’re also outlining to them, that the Irish people – if they claim to share a heritage with us – the Irish people demands of them, that they stopped the slaughter in Gaza,” Gannon said.
Another prominent feature of the discourse surrounding what people can do to support Gaza has focused on boycotts of non-political events like the Eurovision and more recently, the Irish women’s basketball team’sgame against Israel.
Gannon said he fully supports such boycott calls.
“Boycott is an Irish tradition. Boycott is a genuine Irish tradition that was started here during the land leagues,” Gannon said.
He added that he understands the love people have for the Eurovision but that he personally won’t be able to enjoy it this year because of Israel’s participation.
Earlier this week, a poll fromThe Journaland Ireland Thinksfound that three-in-four Irish young peoplefeel that the European Union’s standing has been damaged because of the bloc’s response to the current conflict in Gaza.
Gannon, who unsuccessfully contested the European elections in 2019, agrees that the European project has been damaged as a result.
“I’m somebody who’s a very proud European. When I ran in 2019, I took the decision with my team that we were going to run a very pro-European campaign, which isn’t always the case from the Left.
“But I think what the EU has done towards Israel at the moment, has eroded a lot of confidence in it. And there’s a job of work to be done there to rebuild it,” Gannon said.
“For me, it is something that has tempered that kind of love of Europe,” he added.

Thousands forced to flee as Israeli forces shell and raid south Gaza's largest hospital,"ISRAELI SOLDIERS HAVE stormed the largest hospital in south Gaza, where thousands of displaced people had been taking shelter.
Israel Defence Forces (IDF) raided the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis earlier today, hours after shelling and firing on the building, killing one patient and injuring six more, the Gaza health ministry said.
The hospital was shelled in the early hours of this morning, despite the IDF having told medical staff and patients they could remain in the facility.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) staff reported a chaotic situation in the aftermath of this morning’s shelling, with multiple people injured and one of their colleagues still missing.
The medical NGO’s staff have had to flee the hospital, leaving patients behind.
MSF said Israeli forces set up a checkpoint to screen people leaving the compound and one of their staff members was detained.
The raid comes a day after the IDF issued an order demanding the evacuation of the hospital.
MSFsaid yesterdaythat its staff had witnessed at least five people die and ten others wounded after shots were fired directly at the Khan Younis hospital in recent days.
Khan Younis has been the main target in Israel’s campaign in recent weeks.
Dr Khaled Alserr, one of the remaining surgeons at Nasser Hospital, told AP that the seven patients struck early on Thursday were already being treated for past wounds.
Yesterday, a doctor was lightly wounded when a drone opened fire on the upper stories of the hospital, he said.
“The situation is escalating every hour and every minute,” he said.
The Israeli military said yesterday that it had opened a secure corridor for displaced people to leave the hospital but would allow doctors and patients to remain there.
Videos circulating online showed scores of people walking out of the facility on foot carrying their belongings on their shoulders.
The IDF had already ordered the evacuation of Nasser Hospital and surrounding areas last month.
But as with other health facilities that Israel has invaded in Gaza, doctors said patients were unable to safely leave or be relocated, and thousands of people displaced by fighting elsewhere remained there.

Palestinians say nowhere is safe in the besieged territory, as Israel continues to carry out strikes in all parts of it.
The Gaza health ministry said last week that Israeli snipers on surrounding buildings were preventing people from entering or leaving the hospital.
Prior to Thursday’s strike, it said 10 people had been killed inside the complex over the past week, including three shot and killed on Tuesday.
Israel has claimed responsibility for killing a Hezbollah commander, his deputy and another fighter in an airstrike in Lebanon yesterday.
Ali al-Debs and the other two fighters were killed last night “in a precise air strike carried out by an IDF aircraft on a Hezbollah military structure in Nabatiyeh”, the military said in a statement.
Israel carried out a number of airstrikes against its northern neighbour yesterday that left 10 civilians dead, making it the deadliest day in Lebanon since recent cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah began.
The Iran-backed Lebanese movement, and Hamas ally, said today that it had fired dozens of rockets into northern Israel in a “first response” to yesterday’s strikes.
“In a first response to the massacres in Nabatiyeh and Sawaneh, Islamic resistance fighters fired dozens of Katyusha-type rockets at Kiryat Shmona,” an Israeli town near the Lebanese border, Hezbollah said in a statement.
Hundreds of thousands of Gazans have been driven into the southern city of Rafah, seeking shelter in a sprawling makeshift encampment near the Egyptian border.
“We were displaced from Gaza City to the south,” said Ahlam Abu Assi. “(Then) they told us to go to Rafah, so we went to Rafah.
“We can’t keep going and coming,” she added. “There is no safe place for us.”
Australia, Canada and New Zealand were the latest to warn Israel not to launch a ground offensive in the city, issuing a joint statement saying it would be “devastating” for 1.5 million trapped civilians.
“There is simply nowhere else for civilians to go,” they said.
In Cairo, efforts to secure a ceasefire entered a third day, with negotiators from the United States, Qatar and Egypt trying to broker a deal to suspend the fighting and see an exchange of captives between Israel and Hamas.
CIA director William Burns joined his Israeli counterpart for talks with mediators on Tuesday, while a Hamas delegation was in Cairo yesterday.
There was no sign of immediate progress.

"As global outcry over Gaza grows, a Tel Aviv politics expert tells us what Israelis think","ARE THE ISRAEL Defence Forces (IDF) using the right amount of firepower in Gaza?
Eighty-two percent of Israel’s population think so, according to aPeace Index survey from Tel Aviv Universitylast month. It monitors public sentiment on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The survey found three-quarters of all Israelis believed the number of Palestinians harmed in the course of the conflict – which has killed 28,000 – was justified to achieve its aims.
It’s just one of a number of polls indicating a “sweeping majority” of Israelis support the invasion of Gaza, says Tel Aviv-based political analyst Dahlia Scheindlin.
For the majority of the Israeli public the conflict is an “active war of survival” and a response to an “existential attack” on the state of Israel, explains Scheindlin, a commentator with the liberal Haaretz newspaper.
Dahlia ScheindlinEyal WarshavskyEyal Warshavsky
The mainstream view is that Israel has “no choice” but to attack Hamas in Gaza, with supporters “following every report of all of the achievements” of the IDF, she said.
Media coverage
Much media coverage of the conflict within Israel still centred around the events of 7 October last when Hamas attacked and killed 1,200 people and abducted 253.
Since then, more than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza according to the Gazan Health Ministry.
WhenThe Journallooked at the homepage of the Jerusalem Post yesterday at lunchtime, two of the top five articles referenced the 7 October attacks in their headline.
This holds true for television and radio coverage too, according to Scheindlin.
“The coverage of the conflict is focused on the IDF,” she said.
“It’s footage from their bodycams, it’s drone footage. There will be destroyed buildings and neighbourhoods.
The images and footage of Gaza  shown in media in Europe and the Arab world – of people living in tents, people who are wounded, dead children – are not shown on Israeli television, she added.

Coverage of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza rather “primarily features in conversations among the very, very tiny cluster of Israelis” who would prefer to see a ceasefire.
Views on Netanyahu
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to be a driving force in the conflict, but this doesn’t mean he has remained popular.
Scheindlin, who authored a book about the country’s politics called The Crooked Timber of Democracy in Israel, said recent polling has shown that Netanyahu’s personal ratings have dropped and his coalition parties would lose seats in an election.
A majority believing his decision-making is “tainted” by political maneuvering.
“But he does still have a resilient core of about 25 to 30% who kind of support him in various ways depending on the question in the survey,” she continued.
These questions range from whether a survey asks if Israelis think Netanyahu is still the most suitable person to be Prime Minister to whether he is doing good job.

But while the prime minister’s support has fallen, support for the IDF remains high.
This could be partly attributed to the nature of its defence forces: a reservist policy saw hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens called up in the aftermath of 7 October to support the permanent forces in the invasion of Gaza.
Criticism of Israel from abroad
As for which global voices carry the most weight for Israelis, Scheindlin said it has long been just the US – but recently South Africa has taken on a greater role in discourse around Gaza after it took a case to the International Court of Justice alleging genocide by Israel.
Yesterday,Ireland and Spain called for an urgent reviewof the EU’s trade deal with Israel, while earlier this week government ministerSimon Coveney likened Israel to a  ”rogue state”over its actions in Gaza.
Scheindlin said that Ireland is often “written off as pro-Palestine” in the minds of many Israelis, with criticism from the rest of the world “filtered” through a prism where much of the world is “against us anyway”.
When it comes to criticism of Israel from abroad, there is often a generalised feeling that “it’s a shame everyone is against us”, Scheindlin said.
She added that her perception here was not “suvey based” but reflected “the kinds of conversations that you hear in general about the war”.

Thousands told to evacuate largest hospital in south Gaza as 9 dead after Israel strikes Lebanon,"THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS have been ordered to evacuate the largest hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza by Israeli Defence Forces.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) have said the Israeli Defence Forces knocked down the main gate into the Nasser hospital today and forced thousands of displaced Palestinians inside to evacuate.
The medical NGO has said its teams on the ground in Gaza have witnessed at least five people die and ten others wounded after shots were fired directly at the Khan Younis hospital.
Many displaced Palestinians had been sheltering in the Nasser hospital, the largest hospital in Southern Gaza, as a result of the ongoing bombardment of the Khan Younis province by Israel, according to the charity.
MSF’s Gazan coordinator, Lisa Machenier, said: “People have been forced into an impossible situation: stay at Nasser hospital against the Israeli military’s orders and become a potential target or exit the compound into an apocalyptic landscape where bombings and evacuation orders are part of daily life.”
“Hospitals should be considered as safe places and shouldn’t even be evacuated in the first place,” she added.
Elsewhere in the Middle East, the Israeli army launched its latest slew of strikes on south Lebanon, killing nine people according to the AFP news agency.

While the rocket attack was not immediately claimed, the exchanges of fire raised fears of a broader conflict between Israel and militant group Hezbollah.
Today also marks the worst single-day civilian death toll in Lebanon since cross-border hostilities heated up in October.

Four civilians from the same family, including two women, were killed in an Israeli strike on a residential building in the city of Nabatiyeh, a Lebanese security source told the AFP news agency, updating an initial toll of three dead.
“The residents of the apartment targeted have no links to Hezbollah,” added the source, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Earlier, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) said Israeli warplanes targeted a house in south Lebanon’s Sawwaneh, killing three members of the same family, identifying them as a Syrian woman and her child, aged two, and stepchild, 13.
MSF says many who were seeking refuge in the Nasser hospital now have nowhere to go as the northern regions of Gaza are now “largely destroyed” and checkpoints have been set up to turn people around.
Meanwhile, further south, Israel has been carrying out airstrikes and announced an extensive ground offensive on the city of Rafah which now hosts 1.5 million people.
At least 28,576 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory military offensive on Gaza, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.

Dozens of the estimated 250 hostages seized by Gaza militants during the 7 October attack were freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during a week-long truce in November.
Egyptian and Qatari mediators in Cairo arehoping to secure a ceasefirethat would see more of the roughly 130 hostages still in Gaza released in another swap.
In the last number of days, Tánaiste Micheál Martin and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar have denounced the shelling of Rafah. On Monday, Martin said he is in“no doubt” that the continued bombing of Rafah will “constitute a war crime”.
Today, along with the President of Spain, Varadkarwrote to European Commissioner President Ursula von der Leyenurging a review of the European Union’s trade deal with Israel be conducted amid the “grave” threat in Rafah.
Macheiner said: “People ask us ‘Where is it safe? Where should we go?’ but there is no answer to that, and it really leads to a feeling of despair. People don’t know what to do anymore. They feel unsafe and terrified about what is going to happen next.”

'Where is the escape?' - Reporting from Rafah amid escalating fears of an Israeli invasion,"IN THE WAR-TORN city of Rafah, southern Gaza – until recently a sanctuary for 1.4 million people seeking safety – families find themselves on the move yet again.
In near-constant transit over the past few months, their resilience has been tested with each fresh displacement.
Now Israel has threatened a ground invasion of the densely populated area.
The scene at the sea road is hauntingly familiar—a procession of cars overloaded with blankets, clothes, and meager food supplies, forming a chaotic caravan fleeing the impending perils of conflict.
The Israeli army, issuing confusing evacuation instructions, adds to the plight of Gazans, making life unbearable as they navigate through the labyrinth of war.
The Israeli army’s tightening siege on Gaza and the closure of crucial crossings exacerbates the challenges, causing a significant decline in the flow of aid.
Southern Gaza’s markets stand eerily empty, stripped of essential items like clothes, food, hygiene products, and medical supplies, transforming the displacement experience into a painful ordeal.
With no houses available for rent, displaced families are forced into makeshift tents, constructed from any available nylon and wood, even repurposing agricultural buildings for shelter. Desperation takes on new dimensions as families are found sleeping on the shelves of chicken farms, and others seek refuge in greenhouses.
The scarcity of food for livestock translates into a lack of meat for sustenance, with many enduring months without the luxury of chicken or other meat in their diets.
The once-thriving city now forces its inhabitants to subsist on the bare minimum, as the echoes of conflict reverberate through their daily lives.
The expansion of war in Rafah, the last bastion for people who have fled the conflict from elsewhere in Gaza, raises profound concerns. It threatens to sever the lifeline of assistance into Gaza, plunging its residents into even greater suffering.
As the war encroaches, the fate of those who now call Rafah home hangs in the balance, highlighting the urgent need for international attention and intervention to alleviate the impending humanitarian crisis.
People have been packing their temporary shelters to try and move to safety in the days since the threatened invasion.
“Where is the escape from Rafah?” questioned Mustafa Ibrahim, a Palestinian writer and human rights activist, in a conversation withThe Journal.
He expressed concern over the fear instilled by the prospect of the Israeli army invading Rafah by land.
Ibrahim noted that no country, not even the International Court of Justice, has the capacity to prevent Israel from invading. The court’s rulingthat Israel must take measures to prevent public incitement to commit genocidehas proven ineffective in halting Israel’s actions.
As a displaced Palestinian who relocated from Gaza City to Rafah, Ibrahim said:

“From here, international and Arab warnings seem to be mere rhetoric, as they have not been accompanied by any serious measures to halt the war, killings, and destruction.
“Instead, they appear to provide Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli army with the last opportunity to achieve the war’s objectives and the ‘absolute victory’.”

Also, in Rafah, the price of food items has increased, and the price of wheat sacks has tripled this week as the Israeli army restrict the entry of aid into Gaza.
Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrichdelayed the entry of an American-financed flour shipment into the Gaza Strip, for reasons related to the factthat the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Refugees (UNRWA) would be responsible for distributing this shipment.
Ahmed Sami, 59, is dismantling his tent near the border of Rafah with Egypt, relocating to the central area in anticipation of an imminent Israeli army operation in Rafah.
“This is the fifth time we’ve had to move. Just three weeks ago, we were in Khan Younis when the army instructed us to evacuate the UN shelter amidst tank fire. I left everything behind, even the wheat sacks provided by UNRWA.
“We are uncertain if the new location in Zawaida will be safe, but we fear Rafah will face a fate similar to the north. The Israeli army shows no mercy.”
Ahmed Sami, who moved with his 17-member family to Rafah three weeks ago, is now using his car to transport a nylon cover and wood shelter to another location. The items weigh heavily on the car.
“I used to work as a taxi driver, but with the soaring fuel prices, I can barely cover the moving expenses. I haven’t been able to work for the past five months now.”
While Ahmed has successfully found another place to go, thousands of residents in Rafah are unable to find alternatives.
Rafah has evolved into the largest concentration of displaced people in the Gaza Strip.
Shelter centres are overwhelmed, with tents and bodies stacked up, and there is a severe shortage of humanitarian aid, meeting less than 10% of the people’s needs.
This deficiency highlights the failure of what remains of the ‘ruling authority’ in the Strip to provide essential services.
In a distressing development during this war, several Palestinian police officers lost their lives over the past week due to Israeli airstrikes targeting their police cars in Rafah. Amid the ongoing crisis, the police play a crucial role in aiding organisations to manage aid distribution, protecting civilians, and preventing trader monopolies.
The Israeli army’s deliberate targeting of the police force disrupts essential efforts to maintain order and manage civil affairs in densely populated areas.
With law enforcement absent, the current situation poses a significant risk of descending into chaos, resembling a jungle law scenario, putting the well-being of civilians in jeopardy.

Ireland and Spain ask for urgent review of EU's trade deal with Israel amid 'grave' Rafah threat,"LAST UPDATE|14 Feb
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has called for an “urgent review of whether Israel is complying with its human rights obligations under the EU/Israel Association Agreement”.
The agreement, which came into force in 2000, provides the legal and institutional framework for political dialogue and economic cooperation between the EU and Israel.
Article 2 of the agreementstates that it “shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles”.
However, Leo Varadkar and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez today sent a letter to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen asking that the Commission undertakes an “urgent review of whether Israel is complying with its obligations”.
The letter has also been sent to the vice president of the European Convention on Human Rights Josep Borrell.
The letter adds that if the Commission does consider Israel to be in breach of these obligations, that it should propose “appropriate measures” to consider.
At least 28,473 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel’s response to the 7 October attack by Hamas, according to the Gaza health ministry.
The letter from Varadkar and Sanchez notes that there is “deep concern” at the “impact the ongoing conflict is having on innocent Palestinians,especially women and children”.
It adds that theexpanded Israeli military operation in the Rafah area “poses a grave and imminent threat that the international community must urgently confront”.
Rafah is the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip and has become the latest target in Israel’s military campaign.
The Israeli army is preparing for a ground incursion into the city along the border with Egypt, where displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from fighting further north.
About 1.5 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, with many living in tents, while food, water and medicine are becoming increasingly scarce.
The letter also states that there is “total condemnation of Hamas’ indiscriminate terrorist attacks” on 7 October and that Israel “has a right to defend itself from such attacks”.
However, the letter adds that “this may only be exercised in line with international law” and calls an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”.

Varadar and Sanchez also remarked on the“binding provisional measures imposed by the International Court of Justice” in South Africa’s case against Israel.
“We recall that the ICJ has ordered Israel to take immediate and effective measures to ensure urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance are provided in Gaza,” states the letter.
It adds: “Against the background of the risk of an even greater humanitarian catastrophe posed by the imminent threat of Israeli military operations in Rafah… we ask that the Commission undertake an urgent review of whether Israel is complying with its obligations, including under the EU/Israel Association Agreement, which makes respect for human rights and democratic principles an essential element of the relationship.”
The letter also states that “we must not lose sight of the pressing need for a political perspective to end the conflict”.
“The implementation of the two-State solution is the only way to make sure this cycle of violence does not repeat itself,” said Varadkar and Sanchez.
“The EU has a responsibility to take action to make this a reality.”
Meanwhile, Varadkar’s letter also notesallegations that staff of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) may have been involved in the Hamas attacks of 7 October.
An Israeli intelligence dossier claimed the 12 UNRWA staff members were involved in the attacks that left more than 1,000 people dead.
The head of UNRWA, Phillipe Lazzarini, immediately fired the employees in question and launched an investigation into the allegations.
While Varadkar and Sanchez said they “fully support” this decision, they added that UNRWA must be allowed to operate in Gaza and that EU support to UNRWA must be maintained.
“There is no pathway to achieving the urgent massive and sustained scale up in humanitarian assistance, through full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access that is needed, without UNRWA playing a central role,” said the letter.
Speaking this morning, the European Commission’s deputy chief spokesperson Arianna Podesta confirmed that the Commission has received the letter.
However, Podesta said it was too early to comment on the letter at this stage.
Meanwhile, the EU’s spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Nabila Massrali told a press briefing that the EU “urges all sides to respect international law”.
“There must be accountability for violation of international law and the EU consistently underlines the importance of ensuring the protection of all civilians at all times.
“The EU continues to pass this message in all its statements and also as well bilaterally in its contact with the Israeli authorities.”

Minister Simon Coveney says it’s not 'realistic' for the US to stop supporting Israeli military,"LAST UPDATE|14 Feb
MINISTER FOR ENTERPRISE Simon Coveney has said it is not a “realistic ask for the US to stop militarily supporting Israel”.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Prime Time last night, Coveney said this is “because (US) military support is about an awful lot more than the war in Gaza”.
“It’s also in relation to Iran,” added Coveney, speaking about US military funding to Israel.
Coveney remarked: “We should be realistic, and being realistic means that the US needs to use its influence to bring about a permanent ceasefire and the release of hostages and a future without Hamas, and that is how we will protect lives in the region.”
Coveney also said the actions of Hamas on 7 October “does not justify a continued war effort in Gaza”.
At least 28,473 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel’s response, according to the Gaza health ministry.
“I don’t believe what is happening now is about self-defence,” said Coveney, “this war in Gaza has gone way beyond that and I think most people recognise that, even Israel’s closest allies.”
Yesterday, Coveney also accused Israel of “behaving like a rogue state” as Benjamin Netanyahu’s government pressed ahead with plans for the major offensive.
Foreign governments and the United Nations have voiced increasingly frantic alarm about the possible civilian toll of such an assault.
However, Israel has vowed to press ahead with its campaign until it successfully eradicates Hamas from all of Gaza, including Rafah.

Meanwhile, it has been reported that an Israeli delegation yesterday left talks in Egypt to pause the military campaign in Gaza.
The negotiations were part of an intensifying effort to secure a ceasefire before Israel proceeds with a full-scale ground incursion into the southern city of Rafah, where more than half of the territory’s population has fled.
Israeli intelligence chief David Barnea met CIA Director William Burns in the Egyptian capital for talks on a Qatari-brokered plan to temporarily halt fighting in Gaza.
Both Israeli and US media reported that negotiators left the talks in the capital Cairo without making much progress.
Last night, the Israeli delegation was on its way back from Cairo, an official in Netanyahu’s Office told The Times of Israel.
The Wall Street Journal, citing Egyptian officials, said the Israeli delegation had departed the Egyptian capital “without closing any of the major gaps in the negotiations”.
The talks will continue for another three days, according to Egyptian state-owned television channel Al Qahera, citing a senior Egyptian official.
The same official said the talks had been mostly “positive”, the television channel reported.
Meanwhile, a Hamas source said a member of the group’s political bureau would head a delegation to Cairo to meet the Egyptian and Qatari intelligence chiefs today.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an outspoken critic of Israel’s conduct of the Gaza war, is also due in Cairo today for talks with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

Giving birth in Gaza: 'I resorted to instructional videos on social media',"AMID THE ECHOES of war, 23-year-old Israa Sami’s journey to motherhood sheds light on the profound challenges faced by pregnant women in Gaza.
Israa gave birth to her second child on 15 January in an Emirati field hospital in Rafah, amid displacement and harsh conditions. Her husband, Mohammed Rami, 25, welcomed his first baby girl into the world, saying she provides a glimmer of hope.
“We wish that this war ends soon… Our children deserve to live a better life than the one that we lived and faced” Mohammed told a reporter writing forThe Journalfrom Rafah.
In the midst of the Israeli war on Gaza, Israa – like hundreds of other pregnant women -  faced myriad challenges, adding layers of complexity to their already difficult displacement circumstances.
“I never imagined that I would find myself giving birth in a tent, displaced and deprived of everything – with only bitterness, humiliation and betrayal filling our hearts,” she said.
“After around hundred days of displacement, exhaustion and the burden of pregnancy in the final challenging days, I could no longer bear it.”

As Rafah now accommodates a third of Gaza’s population, there was no empty bed for Israa.
“I had to wait for my turn in the delivery room where tens of pregnant women were going through labour,” she recalled. “I remained standing, waiting for my turn amidst tears of pain.”
After two hours of waiting at the hospital, a bed was made available but after delivery, there was also no suitable place to receive postnatal care.
“I suffered from fever due to the severe cold, and there were no medications except pain relievers,” Israa explained, saying she left the hospital to return to the western Rafah displacement camp on a donkey cart as there were no cars or other vehicles to be found.
“I couldn’t descend,” she said of her arrival. “And there was not enough space for the donkey cart or any other vehicle to pass. I saw a disabled man sitting on a wheelchair, so I asked him for the chair.
“He sympathised with my situation and gave me the chair so I could return to my tent after the pains of childbirth. I passed through the tents and reached my tent, which was extremely cold.”

The United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) reported that about20,000 children have been born in the Gaza Strip since 7 October, including some born through Caesarean sections without anaesthesia. Unicef has also said that many embryos perished in their mothers’ wombs.
Speaking to journalists in Geneva, spokesperson Tess Ingram said, “Motherhood should be a cause for celebration. In Gaza, it’s another child entering a hellish reality.”
Rawan Ahmed, a 27-year-old resident of Jabalia Camp, was evacuated from her home to an UNRWA school in her ninth month of pregnancy last December. The absence of medical facilities and care in Jabalia was her biggest nightmare.
The only hospital in Jabalia, Kamal Adwan Hospital – once a beacon of hope – was laying in ruins due to the Israeli army operations in that area. Desperate for assistance, Rawan’s mother-in-law struggled to find a legal midwife for the impending delivery.
In challenging conditions, Rawan gave birth in a school plagued by diseases, including hepatitis and Covid-19. The absence of healthcare and humanitarian aid deepened the distress, and the meager food (often limited to spoon-fed fava beans and two pieces of candy) provided hardly met her nutritional needs.
According to the World Health Organisation, around50,000 pregnant womenreside in Gaza, with 180 new births daily. Approximately 15% of these expectant mothers are anticipated to experience complications related to pregnancy or childbirth, necessitating additional care. The closure of 14 hospitals and 45 primary healthcare clinics exacerbates their plight, leaving them with limited access to essential services.
Wissam Sbeih, 34, from Gaza City, is currently eight months pregnant with her third child. Confronting the challenges posed by the destruction of hospitals such as Al-Shifa and the absence of healthcare centres, she sought guidance online and found educational videos for self-birthing.
“Given the dire situation and the unavailability of medical facilities, I resorted to instructional videos on social media platforms, particularly onDr. Haya Hajazi‘s Instagram page,” she said.
“Learning how to navigate the birthing process on my own became a crucial survival skill, driven by concerns for both my safety and that of my unborn child.”
Other displaced women like Samia Ahmed, 29, talked about the problems they will face once their babies are born. Samia is currently in Rafah after she left her Al-Rimal neighbourhood in Gaza city on 13 October.
“I’m now in the beginning of my ninth month of pregnancy, I went to the market to find clothes for my newborn,” she said.
“I posted a story on my Instagram seeking help from friends to provide used baby clothes. I visited people in Rafah, knocking on doors to find second-hand clothes for my newborn. I could barely find second-hand clothes,” she added.
Widad Saheeb, 33, gave birth in Khan Younis where she was displaced and she recounted the challenges she faced: “In my eighth month of pregnancy, after fleeing from Gaza City to Khan Yunis, my scheduled medical examination was repeatedly delayed due to the difficult circumstances at hospitals”.
“I gave birth in Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis in early January 2024. The scene was surreal, with women screaming in pain during labour and mourning the loss of their loved ones in nearby rooms. The distance between the delivery room and the room of mourning was tragically short.”

Ayah Mohammed, 32, who gave birth three months before the Israeli war, highlighted the postnatal struggles: “After moving to Khan Yunis with my husband and two daughters, finding formula and diapers in sizes 4 and 5 became challenging.

“We would visit every pharmacy in Khan Yunis, but availability was scarce, and when we did find them, the prices were exorbitant. My husband, who lost his job in Gaza City, struggled to provide, compounding our difficulties.”

Many women have also been separated from their children in Gaza since 7 October. Rawan Mohammed, a 29-year-old divorcee who separated from her husband three years ago, is one woman in this position.
Despite obtaining court permission to see her 13-year-old son Sami on a weekly basis, the relentless war has disrupted proceedings, leaving them unable to reunite.
“Sami is my only child, and since last October, I haven’t seen him once,” Rawan shared. “We fled to Nuseirat in the central area of Gaza Strip with my family, while Sami sought refuge with his father in the same area. The internet and communication networks have become unreliable, making it impossible for me to reach out to him.”
According to Hakim Abu Karsh, a lawyer specialising in legal matters in Gaza, the Israeli war has severely impacted the rights of women and children, hindering their ability to enforce or fulfill judicial decisions.
Legal courts, particularly those handling family matters, have become inaccessible due to the war’s disruptions, denying women like Rawan the opportunity to secure their rightful claims as per personal status laws.
“Among the legitimate rights for women and children are spousal and child support, as well as financial provisions for mothers, adult daughters, and sisters. Additionally, there are issues related to child custody, visitation, child relocation, and divorce matters, to name a few,” explains Abu Karsh.
He further emphasised that many women may have obtained court judgments in their favour, but the ongoing war in Gaza has made it impossible to execute these decisions.
The halt in police operations and the local government’s struggle to maintain security have created a vacuum where the rule of law is challenging to uphold.
Rawan’s plight symbolises the broader struggles faced by women and families in Gaza, where the tides of war have torn apart the fabric of society. Yet, amidst the darkness, stories of resilience and the enduring strength of familial bonds have emerged, casting a light on the human spirit that refuses to be extinguished, even now.
Salma Omar, a 39-year-old who fled north Gaza to a tent in western Rafah said, “I was brutally assaulted by my husband due to economic problems he is facing, resulting in fractures in my left leg and 22 stitches in my head. I attempted to file for divorce, but it became impossible due to the suspension of court proceedings.”
Even women’s care centres are not accessible to affected women. Hala Omar, 24, told believes the burden of war is doubled in women as they don’t have source of income or protection.
“I experienced verbal and physical violence including beatings and insults last October by my brother due to the pressures arising from the war,” she said. “I couldn’t seek refuge at any women’s shelter in the region due to the war, with all places closed. Our continuous displacement exposed me to ongoing violence, making me vulnerable at all times.”

Al Jazeera condemns Israel as reporter's leg blown off in drone strike on Rafah,"LAST UPDATE|13 Feb
BROADCASTER AL JAZEERA has condemned Israel after one of its reporters had his leg blown off, and another reporter was also injured, in a drone strike in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah.
The health ministry in Gaza said reporter Ismail Abu Omar and cameraman Ahmad Matar were hit in the strike from an Israeli warplane in the Moraj area.
The two journalists have been admitted to the European Hospital, on the southern edge of Khan Yunis city.
Abu Omar’s right leg was blown off in the drone strike, while doctors were trying to save the left one, Al Jazeera said quoting an emergency physician.
The Qatar-based network said the strike was a “fully-fledged crime which adds to Israel’s crime against journalists” and was aimed at preventing reporters covering the conflict.
“Targeting the reporter Ismail and cameraman Ahmad is a new episode in a series by the (Israeli) occupation deliberately targeting Al Jazeera crews,” the network said in a statement.

The World Health Organization said the European Hospital is “overwhelmed, overcrowded and undersupplied” with more than 20,000 people sheltering in the hospital.
Hamas’s government media office said it “condemns in the strongest terms the Israeli occupation army’s targeting of the Al Jazeera crew”.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike when contacted by AFP, saying only it would check the details of the incident.
The Committee to Protect Journalists has recorded the deaths of at least 85 journalists and media workers – 78 of them Palestinian – since the conflict erupted on 7 October.
Elsewhere today, South Africa has urged the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to place more legal pressure on Israel to halt its threatened offensive against the densely crowded Gaza city of Rafah.
Pretoria has already made a complaint against Israel at the ICJ in The Hague, alleging that its assault on Gaza amounts to a breach of the Genocide Convention.
The court has yet to rule on the underlying issue, but on 26 January it ordered Israel to ensure in the interim that it takes action to protect Palestinian civilians from further harm and to allow in humanitarian aid.
Israel’s campaign has continued, however, and its forces are preparing an operation against Rafah, where more than half of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have sought shelter from the bombardment.
For South Africa, this is enough to ask the ICJ to revisit its provisional measures and issue a sterner order.
It said it was “gravely concerned that the unprecedented military offensive against Rafah, as announced by the State of Israel, has already led to and will result in further large scale killing, harm and destruction.
“This would be in serious and irreparable breach both of the Genocide Convention and of the Court’s Order of 26 January 2024,” the South African presidency argued.
“South Africa trusts this matter will receive the necessary urgency in light of the daily death toll in Gaza.”

“The international community has been warning against the dangerous consequences of any ground invasion in Rafah. The Government of Israel cannot continue to ignore these calls,” UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said in a statement.
“Military operations in Rafah could lead to a slaughter in Gaza.”
Israel conducted a predawn raid in Rafah yesterday that killed around 100 people and freed two hostages, after rejecting Hamas’s terms for a truce last week.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the overnight operation as “perfect”, while the Palestinian foreign ministry said the deaths of dozens of Gazans amounted to a “massacre”.
Today, US CIA director William Burns met Mossad chief David Barnea in Cairo for a new round of talks on a Qatari-brokered plan to temporarily halt fighting in exchange for Hamas freeing hostages.
The negotiations, which also involved Qatar’s prime minister and Egyptian officials, were “positive” and would continue for three more days, said Egypt’s Al-Qahera News, citing a senior Egyptian official.

Rafah crisis: Simon Coveney accuses Israel of 'behaving like a rogue state',"LAST UPDATE|5 hrs ago
SIMON COVENEY, THE Minister for Enterprise, has accused Israel of “behaving like a rogue state” as Benjamin Netanyahu’s government presses ahead with plans for a major offensive in Rafah in southern Gaza.
“They’re ignoring theInternational Court of Justice,” said Coveney, a former foreign affairs minister.
“They seem now to even be ignoring their closest allies in countries like the United States and the UK, who are clearly calling for restraint, looking for the basis of a ceasefire, wanting to work with Israel to bring an end to this savagery that is continuing in Gaza,” hetold reporters on the way into this morning’s cabinet meeting.
Coveney’s strong words come after Micheál Martin, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, warned that further bombardment of Rafah – where an estimated 1.4 million Palestinians, over half the territory’s population, are trapped –would constitute a war crime.
The Irish government has been among the most vociferous western voices incondemning Netanyahu’s Rafah plans. Israel is under mounting international pressure to agree to a ceasefire with Hamas, as it prepares for an incursion into the southern Gaza city.
China is the latest superpower to urge Israel to desist “as soon as possible”, warning of a “serious humanitarian disaster”.
“China follows closely the developments in the Rafah area, opposes and condemns actions that harm civilians and violate international law,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement.
Beijing urged Israel to “to stop its military operation as soon as possible, (and) make every effort to avoid innocent civilian casualties, in order to prevent a more serious humanitarian disaster in the Rafah area”.

Israel conducted a predawn raid in Rafah on Monday that freed two hostages and killed around 100 people, after rejecting Hamas’s terms for a truce last week.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the overnight operation as “perfect”, while the Palestinian foreign ministry said the deaths of dozens of Gazans amounted to a “massacre”.
The rare rescue mission under heavy air strikes came hours after Netanyahu spoke with US President Joe Biden, who reiterated his opposition to a major assault on Rafah.
Netanyahu ordered the military to prepare a plan to evacuate the population of Rafah ahead of further attacks.
The United Nations has said it is “simply not possible” to do so due to the destruction already caused in Rafah and beyond.
“It’s simply not possible in these circumstances to create any kind of safe evacuation zones in this tiny area that we’re talking about,” Ravina Shamdasani, chief spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.
“There’s even public disorder now because the meager humanitarian assistance that’s getting in, desperate people are having to to to loot and to scramble for it.”
The head of Saudi Arabia’s humanitarian agency told AFP that freezing funds to the agency for Palestinian refugees risks “aiding” the deaths of civilians in Gaza.
Several countries – including the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan – have suspended funding to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in response to Israeli allegations that some of its staff members participated in the Hamas attack.

Dismantling the UNRWA would be a disaster, its chief Philippe Lazzarini said today. Pressure rose after Israel said it had found a Hamas tunnel beneath its Gaza headquarters.
He called for an independent investigation once the conflict between Israel and Hamas is over, looking into the tunnel allegations and the destruction of United Nations premises in the Gaza Strip.
Israel described the mandate of the investigation as vague, but said it would cooperate.
The United Nations has also warned Israel against carrying out a ground offensive into Rafah without a plan to protect civilians, who say they have nowhere left to go.
CIA Director William Burns was due in Cairo today for a new round of talks on a Qatari-brokered ceasefire proposal that would temporarily halt fighting in exchange for Hamas freeing hostages.
His planned visit comes after Washington and the United Nations warned Israel against carrying out a ground offensive into Rafah without a plan to protect civilians, who say they have nowhere left to go.
After White House talks with Jordan’s King Abdullah II on Monday, US President Joe Biden said civilians in Rafah “need to be protected”.
“Many people there have been displaced — displaced multiple times, fleeing the violence to the north, and now they’re packed into Rafah — exposed and vulnerable,” he said.

"As Israel defies US to attack Rafah, where 1.4m people are trapped, what's the world's next move?","IRISH MINISTERS have not held back when asked about Israel’s bombing of the Rafah on Sunday night and prime minister’s Benjamin Netanyahu’s pledge to continue with a full ground offensive in the southern Gazan city.
Simon Coveney, Minister for Enterprise and a former foreign affairs minister,this morning accused Israel of “behaving like a rogue state”.
Yesterday, after the overnight attacks in which 100 people were killed, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin warned that thecontinued bombardment of Rafah “will constitute a war crime”.
Neve Gordon, professor of human rights law at Queen Mary University of London, believes it can be put even more bluntly.
“Rafah itself is a war crime,” says Gordon, vice-president of the British Society for Middle East Studies.
In this, the southernmost area of Gaza, an estimated 1.4m Palestinians – over half the territory’s population – are trapped. Most have fled Israel’s attacks on the north of the enclave. On one side of them there is the closed border with Egypt and on the other the swathe of Gaza subject to Israel’s active ground offensive.
In Rafah, people “do not have enough food, the sanitation is horrendous”, Gordon said.
Israel’s attacks on what was supposed to be Gaza’s last place of safety have marked a new phase in the conflict that has claimed over 28,000 Palestinians’ lives.
Even the staunchest and most powerful international allies of Israel, the US and the UK, have expressed grave concern about Netanyahu’s decision, and about the prospect of the ground offensive in Gaza pressing south into the overcrowded refugee camps of Rafah.
On Monday, US President Joe Biden urged Israel not to carry out a full-scale assault without a “credible” plan to protect people in Rafah. The idea that evacuation of Rafah’s civilians is possible has been flatly contradicted by the UN and ridiculed by the EU.
Hamas has warned that an Israeli push into Rafah will “torpedo” talks on a ceasefire and prisoner-hostage exchanges.Two Israeli hostages were freed in the operation that killed 100 Palestinians overnight.
Why is Israel ignoring its international allies?
“It seems to be to do with Netanyahu’s prospects of staying in power,” Gordon suggests.
One poll published this week indicated Netanyahu’s Likud party would hold just 18 out of the parliament’s 120 seats, with the current opposition winning 75,as reported by The Times of Israel.
Netanyahu has a corruption trial against him pending, while polling after the October 7 attacks by Hamas that killed about 1,160 Israelis indicated most citizens believe he held responsibility for failing to prevent the atrocities.
“The only way for him to stay in power is to continue with the war,” Gordon said. “I think there is something very personal going on and despite the pressure – even from [US President Joe] Biden and the EU – he’s going ahead with the attack on Rafah.”
He noted that the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza is less visible in Israel than outsiders may realise, with little about the impact of Israeli attacks on Palestinians in the mainstream press.

On Monday afternoon, the top three stories on the English language Jerusalem Post, including two about Rafah, focused on Israeli hostages.
What have the US, the EU and the UK said?
Last week, Biden and his officials made it clear that the US did not support an Israeli offensive in Rafah, with the president describing such a move as “over the top”.
Noting that Rafah was also a vital entry point for humanitarian aid into the besieged territory, a US State Department spokesman said that the operation would be “a disaster”.
On Saturday, as it became clear that troops were being mobilised, David Cameron, the UK’s Foreign Secretary, added Britain’s voice to the growing international clamour for Netanyahu to pause his plans.
Deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah – over half of Gaza’s population are sheltering in the area.The priority must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out, then progress towards a sustainable, permanent ceasefire.— David Cameron (@David_Cameron)February 10, 2024
Deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah – over half of Gaza’s population are sheltering in the area.The priority must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out, then progress towards a sustainable, permanent ceasefire.
Yesterday, Cameron condemned Israel’s attack, urging it to “stop and think seriously before it takes any further action”.
He spoke out about the plight of the people trapped in Rafah, “many of whom have moved four, five six times before getting there”.
“It really, we think, is impossible to see how you can fight a war amongst these people, there is nowhere for them to go,” Cameron said.
They can’t go south into Egypt, they can’t go north and back to their homes because many have been destroyed.”
For the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, however, expressions of concerns ring hollow when they come from countries that supply arms to Israel.
Recalling Biden’s “over the top” comment he said: “Well, if you believe that too many people are being killed, maybe you should provide less arms in order to prevent so many people have been killed.”
The EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs also ridiculed Netanyahu’s order to his army toprepare plans to evacuateRafah’s civilian population.
“They are going to evacuate. Where? To the moon? Where are they going to evacuate these people?” Borrell said.
On Saturday, before the offensive began, Borrell warned that it would lead not only to an “unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe” but also to “grave tensions with Egypt”. Like other world leaders, he urged a suspension in hostilities.

Today, Italy’s foreign minister branded Israel’s attacks on Rafah “disproportionate”, while Germany’s foreign minister said Israel had a duty to guarantee “safe corridors” for civilians in Rafah before conducting any incursion. Germany is one of Israel’s closest allies.
What is the situation on the ground in Rafah?
Even before the offensive began the situation for Rafah’s 1.4m residents was “dire”, according to Peter Power, executive director for Ireland of Unicef, the UN’s children’s agency, which has staff on the ground in Gaza.
“There are hundreds of thousands of people living under tarpaulin sheets, some of which we have supplied, literally living from hand to mouth,” Power said.

Some of the last remaining hospitals and healthcare facilities in Gaza are in Rafah but with the local population having increased at least six fold due to the influx of displaced people, these are under enormous strain.

“If they were to be destroyed or damaged the repercussions would be phenomenal,” Power said.
“There are so many people in hospitals, UN shelters and schools. We are appealing to all parties to adhere to their obligations under international law and not target these facilities.”
Any military operation in such a densely populated residential area “will have indiscriminate effects on innocent women and children”, Power adds.
How can the world respond and can a truce be reached?
Gordon believes the “only prospect” of Israel changing course is a threat of sanction from “the EU or US – one is enough”.
“There has to be a certain kind of executive enforcement power otherwise Israel will do as its prime minister wants it to do,” Gordon said.
“What [the US and UK] needs to be doing is saying, ‘if you do not suspend hostilities, that’s it with our economic aid, with our weapons trade’. The minute they say that it’s over and there’ll be a ceasefire.”
On Monday, after talks in Washington with the King of Jordon, Biden insisted the US was working on a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas which would “bring an immediate and sustained period of calm into Gaza” during which a more permanent ceasefire could be agreed.
As international pressure for a truce grows, talks are underway in Cairo today involving the heads of the CIA and Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, as well as Qatar’s Prime Minister. Egypt and Qatar have been mediating between Israel and Hamas with US support.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has called on the UN Security Council to intervene over Rafah.
While the council can institute sanctions, the US has used its permanent members veto repeatedly to protect Israel. Nevertheless Saudi Arabia’s submission – which will gain widespread support from other countries – is “extremely important if only to show the double standards of the US”, Gordon said.
Israel’s ongoing campaign in Gaza comes less than three weeks after the International Court of Justice warned Israel to do everything within its power to prevent genocide against Palestinians. This morning, Coveney accused Israel of flouting the ICJ’s demands.
The International Criminal Court is also watching closely. On Monday, the court’s prosecutor said he was “deeply concerned” by the potential ground incursion by Israeli forces in Rafah.
“All wars have rules and the laws applicable to armed conflict cannot be interpreted so as to render them hollow or devoid of meaning,” said Karim Khan, adding that “those who are in breach of the law will be held accountable”.

"Varadkar says he is abused on the street about Gaza, as Tánaiste says sanctions not ruled out","SPEAKING DURING LEADERS’ Questions today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he thinks it is “irresponsible” for opposition parties to spread the idea that there is something that Ireland can do to change Benjamin Netanyahu’s course of action in Gaza.
He also shared that he has been “shouted at and abused” by the public over the Government’s response to Gaza.
Speaking in the Dáil, he said Israel has become “blinded by rage” and is not even listening to the advice of its close ally the United States anymore.
Responding to Labour leader Ivana Bacik, who urged the Government to do more to support Gaza, Varadkar said people need to be realistic about what Ireland can do and said it is clear to him that Israel is “not listening to any other country in the world”.
“I don’t even think they’re listening to the Americans anymore,” he added.
“We need to be honest with people about that too, because I am concerned that there are people who shout at us in the streets – maybe they don’t do it to you but they certainly do it to me and to my colleagues here – who believe there’s some action that we can take that will change Benjamin Netanyahu’s mind. I think that’s incorrect.
The Journal/ YouTube
“And I don’t think people should spread that idea. I think it’s actually irresponsible.”
Varadkar said it is Ireland’s “strong view” that Israel and Hamas should accept the ceasefire that is on the table.
He defended the Government’s response to the situation in Gaza and said it is very clear Israel is not listening to other countries.
Meanwhile, Tánaiste Micheál Martin told reporters today that Ireland won’t rule anything out when it comes to sanctions that Ireland can impose on Israel.
Speaking to reporters at the Dublin Chamber this afternoon, he said EU member states are “very limited” in acting unilaterally, stating that generally it tends to be EU-wide measures that are taken.
Martin has previously spoken of the need to progress EU sanctions against “violent” settlers in the West Bank, specifically mentioning how Ireland would be “very open” to imposing a travel ban on West Bank settlers.
When asked about whether that will be progressed given the situation facing those in Rafah, Martin said it would be very important for the EU to impose travel bans as a bloc, but stated that Ireland may “call it” at the time if EU states do not take the step together.
Martin is due to travel to Brussels on Monday for the Foreign Affairs Council, where it is expected a decision on such a move could be made.
The US has already imposed travel bans on extremist Jewish settlers implicated in recent attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, such a move by Europe or Ireland would not be seen as out of step.
In terms of recognising the state of Palestine, something the Taoiseach has already indicated he would prefer Ireland to do along with other other EU member states, Martin said today he has held discussions with Arab nations as to what would be the “optimal timing” for Palestine to be recognised.
Martin said the consensus was that the “best time” would be when the Arab Peace Initiative is agreed, adding that it would be the “optimum time” for Ireland to recognise the state of Palestine as it would “give a sense to the Palestinian people that there are a number of countries with you on this, as we begin a journey towards a peace process”.
In terms of action taken by Ireland, Varadkar also pointed to the fact Ireland has increased funding to the United Nations and UNRWA when other countries have suspended their funding.
UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini is due to meet the Tánaiste in Dublin on Thursday. Earlier today, Martin signalled that Ireland could pledge additional funding to the UN agency, above the €18 million by the end of the year.

He also noted that Ireland has called for the EU-Israel trade deal to be suspended based on Ireland’s view that Israel may be in violation of the human rights clause of the agreement.
Varadkar told the Dáil today that he spoke to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen yesterday on suspending the deal with UNRWA stating that it would require unanimity in the European Parliament.
“There is not unanimity at EU level to do so,” the Taoiseach said.
He added that Ireland is currently in discussion with other EU allies on recognising Palestine as a state.
His comments come as opposition parties continue to call on the Government to do more.
Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns said Israel’s actions in Rafah since the weekend should result in a massive change in response from other countries, including Ireland.
Cairns, who was speaking to reporters at Leinster House this morning, said the Irish Government needs to match its “very strong words of condemnation” with action.
Yesterday, Israel conducted a predawn raid in Rafah that freed two hostages and killed around 100 people. This came after it rejected Hamas’s terms for a truce last week.
Israel has come under mounting international pressure as it prepares for an incursion into the southern Gaza city.
Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the military to prepare a plan to evacuate the population of Rafah ahead of further attacks but the United Nations has said it is “simply not possible” to do so due to the destruction already caused in Rafah and beyond.
An estimated 1.4 million Palestinians, over half the territory’s population, are trapped in Rafah.
Cairns today called for the Irish Government to push for trade sanctions against Israel, make a referral to the International Criminal Court and to support South Africa’s genocide case against Israel.
She added that at a national level the Government should support the Occupied Territories Bill and the Illegal Settlements Bill.
“I don’t know what exactly they’re waiting for but I think it’s very clear to everybody, that there’s a huge, huge discrepancy in the Government’s approach to the brutal invasion of Ukraine, compared to the brutal invasion of Gaza,” Cairns said.
She added: “Now is the time for the Government to change its approach.”
Cairns also welcomed comments from the Taoiseach last week when he said Ireland is seeking the support of fellow EU member states for a review of the EU-Israel trade agreement, something the Social Democrats have been demanding for months.
“It’s a shame it took so long but of course, it’s really, really welcomed,” she said.
Cairns added that comments made this morning by Minister Simon Coveney were welcome, but now need to be followed up with action.
On his way into Cabinet this morning, Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney accused Israel of acting like a rogue state.
“They’re ignoring theInternational Court of Justice,” said Coveney, a former foreign affairs minister.
“They seem now to even be ignoring their closest allies in countries like the United States and the UK, who are clearly calling for restraint, looking for the basis of a ceasefire, wanting to work with Israel to bring an end to this savagery that is continuing in Gaza,” he said.

Rafah crisis: Simon Coveney accuses Israel of 'behaving like a rogue state',"LAST UPDATE|5 hrs ago
SIMON COVENEY, THE Minister for Enterprise, has accused Israel of “behaving like a rogue state” as Benjamin Netanyahu’s government presses ahead with plans for a major offensive in Rafah in southern Gaza.
“They’re ignoring theInternational Court of Justice,” said Coveney, a former foreign affairs minister.
“They seem now to even be ignoring their closest allies in countries like the United States and the UK, who are clearly calling for restraint, looking for the basis of a ceasefire, wanting to work with Israel to bring an end to this savagery that is continuing in Gaza,” hetold reporters on the way into this morning’s cabinet meeting.
Coveney’s strong words come after Micheál Martin, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, warned that further bombardment of Rafah – where an estimated 1.4 million Palestinians, over half the territory’s population, are trapped –would constitute a war crime.
The Irish government has been among the most vociferous western voices incondemning Netanyahu’s Rafah plans. Israel is under mounting international pressure to agree to a ceasefire with Hamas, as it prepares for an incursion into the southern Gaza city.
China is the latest superpower to urge Israel to desist “as soon as possible”, warning of a “serious humanitarian disaster”.
“China follows closely the developments in the Rafah area, opposes and condemns actions that harm civilians and violate international law,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement.
Beijing urged Israel to “to stop its military operation as soon as possible, (and) make every effort to avoid innocent civilian casualties, in order to prevent a more serious humanitarian disaster in the Rafah area”.

Israel conducted a predawn raid in Rafah on Monday that freed two hostages and killed around 100 people, after rejecting Hamas’s terms for a truce last week.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the overnight operation as “perfect”, while the Palestinian foreign ministry said the deaths of dozens of Gazans amounted to a “massacre”.
The rare rescue mission under heavy air strikes came hours after Netanyahu spoke with US President Joe Biden, who reiterated his opposition to a major assault on Rafah.
Netanyahu ordered the military to prepare a plan to evacuate the population of Rafah ahead of further attacks.
The United Nations has said it is “simply not possible” to do so due to the destruction already caused in Rafah and beyond.
“It’s simply not possible in these circumstances to create any kind of safe evacuation zones in this tiny area that we’re talking about,” Ravina Shamdasani, chief spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.
“There’s even public disorder now because the meager humanitarian assistance that’s getting in, desperate people are having to to to loot and to scramble for it.”
The head of Saudi Arabia’s humanitarian agency told AFP that freezing funds to the agency for Palestinian refugees risks “aiding” the deaths of civilians in Gaza.
Several countries – including the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan – have suspended funding to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in response to Israeli allegations that some of its staff members participated in the Hamas attack.

Dismantling the UNRWA would be a disaster, its chief Philippe Lazzarini said today. Pressure rose after Israel said it had found a Hamas tunnel beneath its Gaza headquarters.
He called for an independent investigation once the conflict between Israel and Hamas is over, looking into the tunnel allegations and the destruction of United Nations premises in the Gaza Strip.
Israel described the mandate of the investigation as vague, but said it would cooperate.
The United Nations has also warned Israel against carrying out a ground offensive into Rafah without a plan to protect civilians, who say they have nowhere left to go.
CIA Director William Burns was due in Cairo today for a new round of talks on a Qatari-brokered ceasefire proposal that would temporarily halt fighting in exchange for Hamas freeing hostages.
His planned visit comes after Washington and the United Nations warned Israel against carrying out a ground offensive into Rafah without a plan to protect civilians, who say they have nowhere left to go.
After White House talks with Jordan’s King Abdullah II on Monday, US President Joe Biden said civilians in Rafah “need to be protected”.
“Many people there have been displaced — displaced multiple times, fleeing the violence to the north, and now they’re packed into Rafah — exposed and vulnerable,” he said.

"As Israel defies US to attack Rafah, where 1.4m people are trapped, what's the world's next move?","IRISH MINISTERS have not held back when asked about Israel’s bombing of the Rafah on Sunday night and prime minister’s Benjamin Netanyahu’s pledge to continue with a full ground offensive in the southern Gazan city.
Simon Coveney, Minister for Enterprise and a former foreign affairs minister,this morning accused Israel of “behaving like a rogue state”.
Yesterday, after the overnight attacks in which 100 people were killed, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin warned that thecontinued bombardment of Rafah “will constitute a war crime”.
Neve Gordon, professor of human rights law at Queen Mary University of London, believes it can be put even more bluntly.
“Rafah itself is a war crime,” says Gordon, vice-president of the British Society for Middle East Studies.
In this, the southernmost area of Gaza, an estimated 1.4m Palestinians – over half the territory’s population – are trapped. Most have fled Israel’s attacks on the north of the enclave. On one side of them there is the closed border with Egypt and on the other the swathe of Gaza subject to Israel’s active ground offensive.
In Rafah, people “do not have enough food, the sanitation is horrendous”, Gordon said.
Israel’s attacks on what was supposed to be Gaza’s last place of safety have marked a new phase in the conflict that has claimed over 28,000 Palestinians’ lives.
Even the staunchest and most powerful international allies of Israel, the US and the UK, have expressed grave concern about Netanyahu’s decision, and about the prospect of the ground offensive in Gaza pressing south into the overcrowded refugee camps of Rafah.
On Monday, US President Joe Biden urged Israel not to carry out a full-scale assault without a “credible” plan to protect people in Rafah. The idea that evacuation of Rafah’s civilians is possible has been flatly contradicted by the UN and ridiculed by the EU.
Hamas has warned that an Israeli push into Rafah will “torpedo” talks on a ceasefire and prisoner-hostage exchanges.Two Israeli hostages were freed in the operation that killed 100 Palestinians overnight.
Why is Israel ignoring its international allies?
“It seems to be to do with Netanyahu’s prospects of staying in power,” Gordon suggests.
One poll published this week indicated Netanyahu’s Likud party would hold just 18 out of the parliament’s 120 seats, with the current opposition winning 75,as reported by The Times of Israel.
Netanyahu has a corruption trial against him pending, while polling after the October 7 attacks by Hamas that killed about 1,160 Israelis indicated most citizens believe he held responsibility for failing to prevent the atrocities.
“The only way for him to stay in power is to continue with the war,” Gordon said. “I think there is something very personal going on and despite the pressure – even from [US President Joe] Biden and the EU – he’s going ahead with the attack on Rafah.”
He noted that the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza is less visible in Israel than outsiders may realise, with little about the impact of Israeli attacks on Palestinians in the mainstream press.

On Monday afternoon, the top three stories on the English language Jerusalem Post, including two about Rafah, focused on Israeli hostages.
What have the US, the EU and the UK said?
Last week, Biden and his officials made it clear that the US did not support an Israeli offensive in Rafah, with the president describing such a move as “over the top”.
Noting that Rafah was also a vital entry point for humanitarian aid into the besieged territory, a US State Department spokesman said that the operation would be “a disaster”.
On Saturday, as it became clear that troops were being mobilised, David Cameron, the UK’s Foreign Secretary, added Britain’s voice to the growing international clamour for Netanyahu to pause his plans.
Deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah – over half of Gaza’s population are sheltering in the area.The priority must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out, then progress towards a sustainable, permanent ceasefire.— David Cameron (@David_Cameron)February 10, 2024
Deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah – over half of Gaza’s population are sheltering in the area.The priority must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out, then progress towards a sustainable, permanent ceasefire.
Yesterday, Cameron condemned Israel’s attack, urging it to “stop and think seriously before it takes any further action”.
He spoke out about the plight of the people trapped in Rafah, “many of whom have moved four, five six times before getting there”.
“It really, we think, is impossible to see how you can fight a war amongst these people, there is nowhere for them to go,” Cameron said.
They can’t go south into Egypt, they can’t go north and back to their homes because many have been destroyed.”
For the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, however, expressions of concerns ring hollow when they come from countries that supply arms to Israel.
Recalling Biden’s “over the top” comment he said: “Well, if you believe that too many people are being killed, maybe you should provide less arms in order to prevent so many people have been killed.”
The EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs also ridiculed Netanyahu’s order to his army toprepare plans to evacuateRafah’s civilian population.
“They are going to evacuate. Where? To the moon? Where are they going to evacuate these people?” Borrell said.
On Saturday, before the offensive began, Borrell warned that it would lead not only to an “unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe” but also to “grave tensions with Egypt”. Like other world leaders, he urged a suspension in hostilities.

Today, Italy’s foreign minister branded Israel’s attacks on Rafah “disproportionate”, while Germany’s foreign minister said Israel had a duty to guarantee “safe corridors” for civilians in Rafah before conducting any incursion. Germany is one of Israel’s closest allies.
What is the situation on the ground in Rafah?
Even before the offensive began the situation for Rafah’s 1.4m residents was “dire”, according to Peter Power, executive director for Ireland of Unicef, the UN’s children’s agency, which has staff on the ground in Gaza.
“There are hundreds of thousands of people living under tarpaulin sheets, some of which we have supplied, literally living from hand to mouth,” Power said.

Some of the last remaining hospitals and healthcare facilities in Gaza are in Rafah but with the local population having increased at least six fold due to the influx of displaced people, these are under enormous strain.

“If they were to be destroyed or damaged the repercussions would be phenomenal,” Power said.
“There are so many people in hospitals, UN shelters and schools. We are appealing to all parties to adhere to their obligations under international law and not target these facilities.”
Any military operation in such a densely populated residential area “will have indiscriminate effects on innocent women and children”, Power adds.
How can the world respond and can a truce be reached?
Gordon believes the “only prospect” of Israel changing course is a threat of sanction from “the EU or US – one is enough”.
“There has to be a certain kind of executive enforcement power otherwise Israel will do as its prime minister wants it to do,” Gordon said.
“What [the US and UK] needs to be doing is saying, ‘if you do not suspend hostilities, that’s it with our economic aid, with our weapons trade’. The minute they say that it’s over and there’ll be a ceasefire.”
On Monday, after talks in Washington with the King of Jordon, Biden insisted the US was working on a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas which would “bring an immediate and sustained period of calm into Gaza” during which a more permanent ceasefire could be agreed.
As international pressure for a truce grows, talks are underway in Cairo today involving the heads of the CIA and Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, as well as Qatar’s Prime Minister. Egypt and Qatar have been mediating between Israel and Hamas with US support.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has called on the UN Security Council to intervene over Rafah.
While the council can institute sanctions, the US has used its permanent members veto repeatedly to protect Israel. Nevertheless Saudi Arabia’s submission – which will gain widespread support from other countries – is “extremely important if only to show the double standards of the US”, Gordon said.
Israel’s ongoing campaign in Gaza comes less than three weeks after the International Court of Justice warned Israel to do everything within its power to prevent genocide against Palestinians. This morning, Coveney accused Israel of flouting the ICJ’s demands.
The International Criminal Court is also watching closely. On Monday, the court’s prosecutor said he was “deeply concerned” by the potential ground incursion by Israeli forces in Rafah.
“All wars have rules and the laws applicable to armed conflict cannot be interpreted so as to render them hollow or devoid of meaning,” said Karim Khan, adding that “those who are in breach of the law will be held accountable”.

UN describes prospect of Israeli ground invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza as 'terrifying',"LAST UPDATE|24 hrs ago
THE PROSPECT OF a full-scale Israeli ground invasion of the southern Palestinian city of Rafa is “terrifying”, the UN’s high commissioner for human rights Volker Turk has said.
Rafah is the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip and has become the latest target in Israel’s military campaign. Turk’s comments come as a number of Israel’s allies have expressed fears that a ground invasion would result in too many civilian casualties.
The Israeli army is preparing for a ground incursion into the teeming city along the border with Egypt, where displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from fighting further north.
About 1.5 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, with many living in tents, while food, water and medicine are becoming increasingly scarce.
In a statement today, Turk said that “those with influence must restrain rather than enable” Israel.
“A potential full-fledged military incursion into Rafah – where some 1.5 million Palestinians are packed against the Egyptian border with nowhere further to flee – is terrifying, given the prospect that an extremely high number of civilians, again mostly children and women, will likely be killed and injured,” he said.
“Around 100 people” were killed todayin predawn Israeli strikes on Rafah, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Three mosques were also hit.
Israel announced that it recovered two hostages in the city during the strikes.
Karim Khan, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, today said he is “deeply concerned” by the reported bombing and potential ground incursion of Rafah.
Khan said his office has an “ongoing and active investigation” into the Gaza situation.
“This is being taken forward as a matter of the utmost urgency, with a view to bringing to justice those responsible for Rome Statute crimes,” he said.

Speaking to reporters in Cork this morning, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said he is in “no doubt” that the continued bombing of Rafah will “constitute a war crime”.

He added that, in his view, it “gravely violates international humanitarian law”.
“To bomb and to mount a military operation in such a confined area, with so many people, is absolutely inhumane, unacceptable, and the international community must do everything it possibly can to put the pressure on Israel not to proceed with this invasion,” Martin said.
He said the attacks will “create catastrophic conditions”.
The United Nations “will not be party” to any forced displacement of Palestinians currently living in Rafah, the spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said today, saying there was nowhere safe in Gaza for them to go.
“We will not be party to forced displacement of people,” Dujarric said. “As it is, there is no place that is currently safe in Gaza.”
“You can’t send people back to areas that are littered with unexploded ordnance, not to mention a lack of shelter,” the UN spokesman said, referring to parts of the northern and central Gaza Strip.
He reiterated that humanitarian aid entering Gaza is still insufficient, warning that the available supplies “may last us just days.”
Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich, however, has said the military operation in Rafah is “necessary” to continue the release of hostages and “eliminate” Hamas.
Erlich told RTÉ’sNews at Onethat what is happening in Gaza is “tragic” and Israel needs to “make sure that we hold the correct people accountable for that”.
“The tragedy of this war that started on October 7 by Hamas, is this cynical playbook by this genocidal terrorist organisation who are not just terrorists, they are cowards,” Erlich said.
She said Israel is “committed to international law”.
Erlich said that Israel has targeted other areas of Gaza in a “very calculated way” and provided citizens with “announcements beforehand”.
When asked where is left for those displaced to evacuate to, she said: ”What we’ve seen is that we’re damned when we do and damned when we don’t when we tell them where to evacuate, then we are condemned for telling them to evacuate.
“We don’t want to see any more civilians get hurt. There’s no need for anyone else to die. This can all end if all of the kidnapped will be released by Hamas.”
The Palestinian foreign ministry has condemned what it called a “massacre” in Rafah last night and accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of “a mentality of revenge”.

US President Joe Biden told Netanyahu yesterday that a Rafah advance should not go ahead without a “credible” plan to ensure “the safety” of people sheltering there, the White House said. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller reiterated that position today.
“Without such a plan that is credible, and that they can execute, we do not support a full-scale military operation,” Miller told reporters.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has today urged allies of Israel – primarily the US – to stop sending it weapons as “too many people” are being killed in Gaza.
Pointing to Biden’s comment last week that Israel’s military action was “over the top”, Borrell said: “Well, if you believe that too many people are being killed, maybe you should provide less arms in order to prevent so many people have been killed.”
Netanyahu had told US broadcaster ABC News the Rafah operation would go ahead and continue until Hamas is eliminated, adding that Israel would provide “safe passage” to civilians trying to leave.
Borrell slammed an order by Netanyahu that the more than one million Palestinians sheltering in Rafah need to be “evacuated” ahead of the military operation,
“They are going to evacuate – where? To the moon? Where are they going to evacuate these people?” Borrell asked.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron has said Israel should “stop and think seriously” before taking further action in Rafah.
Cameron said many of the people in Rafah had already fled from other areas and said it is “impossible to see how you can fight a war amongst these people, there is nowhere for them to go”.
The British Prime Minister’s official spokesman said they were “deeply concerned” about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah.
About 130 of the original 250 captives taken by Hamas more than four months ago are still believed to be held in Gaza, although Israel presumes 29 of them are dead.
At least 28,340 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel’s assault on Gaza since 7 October, according to the territory’s health ministry.

The EU's Israel-Gaza response has been poor according to two-thirds of Irish voters,"THE EUROPEAN UNION’S standing has been damaged among three-in-four Irish young people as a result of the bloc’s response to the current conflict in Gaza.
In the first poll on voting preferences and sentiment ahead of June’s European elections,The Journal/Ireland Thinks found that those surveyed across all aged groups were markedly unsatisfied with the EU’s handling of the conflict.
The response of EU leadership figures to the deadly 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel and the death and destruction in Gaza that has followed has sparked tensions among different member states.
In the day’s following the Hamas attack, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the European Union stood with Israel “today and in the days to come” and “in the next weeks”.
Her comments and her subsequent trip to Israel were judged by some, including Irish MEPs, to be akin to givingunconditional support to military action.
Following an EU Council meeting in December, the summitended without a decision to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, despite the urging of Ireland and some other nations.
The disconnect between the wider view in the EU and the view of Irish voters is reflected in this latest poll.

When asked to rate on a scale from1-5(1 being ‘very bad’ and 5 being ‘very good’) how they rated the EU’s performance on Israel/Gaza, by far the most popular selection (44%) was1.
The average rating across all voters was2.
Only11%gave a score (4 or 5) which would be categorised as positive while negative marks made up two-thirds of those surveyed. Those who landed in the middle at3made up22%of respondents.

As well as rating the EU’s performance on the issue, a separate question also probed whether their “view of the EU had changed since the escalation of the conflict”.
In response to that question, over half (51%) say their opinion of the EU had either ‘somewhat disimproved’ or ‘much disimproved’.
The largest single cohort, at43%, however said that their opinion of the EU had not changed as a result of the conflict.
The polling also provides a breakdown of responses across a number of different categories, including age and party allegiance, and shows noteworthy differences across different age groups.
Among 18-34 year-olds,75%of those surveyed said that their views on the EU have disimproved as a result of the conflict. By comparison, the corresponding figure among the 45-54 age group was45%.
In terms of party allegiance, the highest average rating for the EU’s performance on the conflict came from Fine Gael voters, who rated the performance at2.7out of 5.
The lowest rating was from Solidarity-PBP voters at1.2, whereas the average rating across all voters was2.

Ukraine

The poll also gauged sentiment on a number of other issues relevant to the upcoming EU elections, with those surveyed asked about Ukraine’s application to join the EU and the prospect of that application being fast-tracked.
There was overall enthusiasm for Ukraine’s membership, with72%being in favour, a figure that’s made up of33%favouring a fast-tracked application and39%favouring a regular application.
One in five people (20%) were not in favour of Ukraine’s membership of the EU, but again there were some noteworthy numbers based on a voter’s party affiliation.
Over half of Aontú voters (57%) were opposed to Ukraine’s membership of the EU, with Independent voters (48%) and Solidarity-PBP voters (48%) also largely opposed to Kyiv’s application.
Climate
Respondents were asked to rate the EU’s performance on the response to the climate emergency on the same 1-5 rating system, with the overall average rating coming in at2.8.
That average score was relatively consistent across the age groups, with a score of3the most popular selection across all six age ranges.
Big tech
As the EU’s HQ for many of the world’s biggest tech firms, Ireland has a particular interest in how the EU plans to regulate the industry.
There have been, for example, effortsby the EU to restrict Meta from using personal dataand moves by theEU to investigate disinformation on X, formerly Twitter.
Asked in the poll to rate the EU’s performance on reigning in big tech, only22%of respondents gave a positive score.
The average score across all age groups was2.6, with younger people aged 18-34 giving an above average score of2.8.
Enthusiasm to vote

Overall there appears to be a motivation among those polled to vote in the European elections, with83%saying they were very likely to do so,12%saying they were somewhat likely and only5%saying they were unlikely to.
Among those poll, 35-44 years olds were the most enthusiastic likely voters, with90%saying they were very likely to vote.
The Journal/Ireland Thinks series of polls will run each month ahead of the European parliament elections in June. It will continue to explore voter intentions, measure Irish public sentiment towards the EU on a number of issues and highlight any potential opinion gaps between different demographics of Irish society on matters important to them.
The poll of 1,255 people was carried out between the 2 and 7 February and has a  margin of error of 2.8%.

 Israel has pursued the relentless massacre of innocent Palestinians in Gaza","LAST UPDATE|19 hrs ago
SINCE 27 OCTOBER last, Israel’s brutal ground invasion of Gaza has lasted 108 days. In this time, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have reportedly killed over 28,000 Palestinians and seriously wounding a further 70,000.
Of this total, Netanyahu claims that the IDF has ‘eliminated’ approximately 9000 Hamas fighters. If true, this means that a staggering 70% of the casualties of the IDF’s ground campaign are innocent civilians. Therefore, for each day of Israel’s campaign, an average of 183 innocent men, women and children have been slaughtered by Israeli troops.
In addition, an average of 453 innocent Gazans have been permanently maimed and disfigured on a daily basis in airstrikes, tank fire, sniper attacks and indiscriminate fire from Israeli forces.
These figures are set to spiral in the coming days as Israel’s ground campaign enters its final phase – an all out assault on Rafah. Thus far in the invasion of Gaza, the Palestinian population has endured three ‘evacuations’ or forced expulsions. Contrary to the provisions of the Geneva Conventions, over a million Gazans have been forced at gunpoint – and under continuing harassing fire – to flee Gaza City in the north to Khan Younis.
With Israel’s assault on Khan Younis, which lasted approximately nine weeks, the internally displaced civilian population then had to flee to Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza located on the border with Egypt. Over 1.5 million civilians are now trapped in this city, increasing its original population tenfold.

Netanyahu’s repeatedly stated war aims have been twofold. To destroy Hamas in its entirety and to secure the release of over 100 remaining Israeli hostages – abducted by Hamas in its assault of mass murder on Israel on 7 October. In this bestial attack, Hamas murdered over 1,300 Israeli men, women and children. It should be noted that Hamas continues to commit war crimes – by holding these hostages and by continuing to fire rockets and missiles at civilian targets in Israel on a daily basis.
Israel’s military targets in Rafah will include the remaining four Battalions of Hamas fighters based there. The Israelis will also seek to find and kill any other Hamas fighters who have exfiltrated south from the occupied zones of Gaza and Khan Younis to Rafah.
The IDF will also seek to ‘neutralise’ the so-called ‘Saladin Axis’ or ‘Philadelphi Corridor’ – a narrow strip of land at the southern end of Rafah, along the entire length of the border between Gaza and Egypt – from the Kerem Shalom border crossing in the east, through the Rafah border crossing and west to the Mediterranean.
In destroying Rafah and entering and occupying the Philadelphi Corridor – however temporarily – the IDF’s objectives include apprehending or killing the leadership of Hamas, which remains at large, and destroying the tunnel network between Gaza and Egypt. In achieving these objectives, Israel will have to wage highly kinetic combat operations right on to the Egyptian border – risking the 1979 Israeli/Egyptian Peace Treaty and the Philadelphi Corridor Accord of 2004.
These strategic concerns however pale into insignificance compared to the pitiful plight of the Gazan population – over 1.5 million men, women and children concentrated into what will become a high intensity combat zone. It is likely that ground combat in Rafah would take at least nine weeks to meet its stated objectives. If the coerced and concentrated population is not evacuated – civilian casualties will be exponentially higher than before, with tens of thousands of Gazan men, women and children facing imminent slaughter.
That would represent the literal and metaphorical decimation of the Palestinian people in Gaza. If Netanyahu persists with this assault, it will represent an unfolding crime against humanity of Biblical proportions.
Notwithstanding the imminent assault on Rafah, the civilian population there is in such extremis that what is required is an immediate and permanent ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid, water, sanitation and medical assistance to be rendered. There is almost universal alarm among even Israel’s most staunch allies at the prospect of the continued prosecution of the war into the last refuge of Rafah. The US administration is alarmed at a possible backlash in the Arab world – with a regional escalation involving Hezbollah in Lebanon, and a potential direct confrontation with Iran.

President Biden has called Israel’s excessive – and illegal – use of force as ‘over the top’ or disproportionate. In a 45-minute call with Netanyahu, President Biden insisted that Israel come up with a ‘credible’ plan for the civilian population trapped in Rafah. Such a credible plan – presumably involving the evacuation of the entire civilian population, along a ‘safe evacuation corridor’ to a ‘safe zone’ – is hard to envisage.
It is unlikely that Gazans would willingly evacuate to Khan Younis – now occupied by hostile IDF forces. Nor is it likely that 1.5 million people could be safely or reliably evacuated to Al-Mawasi just north east of Rafah – or further north into central Gaza. Even Britain’s foreign secretary, David Cameron – a staunch ally of Israel – has expressed incredulity at Netanyahu’s intention to assault Rafah. ‘We think it is impossible to see how you can fight a war amongst these people. There’s nowhere for them to go… we want Israel to stop and think very seriously before it takes any further action. But above all, we want an immediate pause in the fighting and we want that pause to lead to a ceasefire’.
As I write this analysis, dozens of Palestinian men, women and children have been killed overnight in Rafah – with more casualties from sniper fire reported during the day. Israeli helicopter gun ships are reportedly hovering over the southern and eastern boundaries of Rafah – machinegunning civilian targets in what is a de-facto free-fire zone. As a UN peacekeeper, I witnessed similar tactics in Lebanon almost 30 years ago – with innocent men, women – and shamefully – children, being the principal victims of war fought in and among the civilian population. It is utterly depressing to see this relentless massacre of the Palestinian people by an Israeli state – led by Netanyahu and the far-right – that, by its rogue actions, brings Israel into international disrepute.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Iran – for once, aligned – are clear in their condemnation of and unease with Netanyahu’s actions in Rafah. In the last 24 hours, the IDF has launched further airstrikes into Lebanon at Tayr Harfu and Maroun al-Ras. There is a real risk of a wider regional escalation of Netanyahu’s war – which would bring with it far-reaching and potentially devastating consequences for the Middle East, Europe and the United States. Iran’s principal military ally – Vladimir Putin – will undoubtedly benefit from the ongoing disaster that is Netanyahu’s leadership of Israel.
With the prospect – perhaps – of a Trump presidency in an increasingly unstable global security environment, the entire world should be calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. For the sake of all Palestinians. For all our sakes.

UN describes prospect of Israeli ground invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza as 'terrifying',"LAST UPDATE|24 hrs ago
THE PROSPECT OF a full-scale Israeli ground invasion of the southern Palestinian city of Rafa is “terrifying”, the UN’s high commissioner for human rights Volker Turk has said.
Rafah is the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip and has become the latest target in Israel’s military campaign. Turk’s comments come as a number of Israel’s allies have expressed fears that a ground invasion would result in too many civilian casualties.
The Israeli army is preparing for a ground incursion into the teeming city along the border with Egypt, where displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from fighting further north.
About 1.5 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, with many living in tents, while food, water and medicine are becoming increasingly scarce.
In a statement today, Turk said that “those with influence must restrain rather than enable” Israel.
“A potential full-fledged military incursion into Rafah – where some 1.5 million Palestinians are packed against the Egyptian border with nowhere further to flee – is terrifying, given the prospect that an extremely high number of civilians, again mostly children and women, will likely be killed and injured,” he said.
“Around 100 people” were killed todayin predawn Israeli strikes on Rafah, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Three mosques were also hit.
Israel announced that it recovered two hostages in the city during the strikes.
Karim Khan, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, today said he is “deeply concerned” by the reported bombing and potential ground incursion of Rafah.
Khan said his office has an “ongoing and active investigation” into the Gaza situation.
“This is being taken forward as a matter of the utmost urgency, with a view to bringing to justice those responsible for Rome Statute crimes,” he said.

Speaking to reporters in Cork this morning, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said he is in “no doubt” that the continued bombing of Rafah will “constitute a war crime”.

He added that, in his view, it “gravely violates international humanitarian law”.
“To bomb and to mount a military operation in such a confined area, with so many people, is absolutely inhumane, unacceptable, and the international community must do everything it possibly can to put the pressure on Israel not to proceed with this invasion,” Martin said.
He said the attacks will “create catastrophic conditions”.
The United Nations “will not be party” to any forced displacement of Palestinians currently living in Rafah, the spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said today, saying there was nowhere safe in Gaza for them to go.
“We will not be party to forced displacement of people,” Dujarric said. “As it is, there is no place that is currently safe in Gaza.”
“You can’t send people back to areas that are littered with unexploded ordnance, not to mention a lack of shelter,” the UN spokesman said, referring to parts of the northern and central Gaza Strip.
He reiterated that humanitarian aid entering Gaza is still insufficient, warning that the available supplies “may last us just days.”
Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich, however, has said the military operation in Rafah is “necessary” to continue the release of hostages and “eliminate” Hamas.
Erlich told RTÉ’sNews at Onethat what is happening in Gaza is “tragic” and Israel needs to “make sure that we hold the correct people accountable for that”.
“The tragedy of this war that started on October 7 by Hamas, is this cynical playbook by this genocidal terrorist organisation who are not just terrorists, they are cowards,” Erlich said.
She said Israel is “committed to international law”.
Erlich said that Israel has targeted other areas of Gaza in a “very calculated way” and provided citizens with “announcements beforehand”.
When asked where is left for those displaced to evacuate to, she said: ”What we’ve seen is that we’re damned when we do and damned when we don’t when we tell them where to evacuate, then we are condemned for telling them to evacuate.
“We don’t want to see any more civilians get hurt. There’s no need for anyone else to die. This can all end if all of the kidnapped will be released by Hamas.”
The Palestinian foreign ministry has condemned what it called a “massacre” in Rafah last night and accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of “a mentality of revenge”.

US President Joe Biden told Netanyahu yesterday that a Rafah advance should not go ahead without a “credible” plan to ensure “the safety” of people sheltering there, the White House said. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller reiterated that position today.
“Without such a plan that is credible, and that they can execute, we do not support a full-scale military operation,” Miller told reporters.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has today urged allies of Israel – primarily the US – to stop sending it weapons as “too many people” are being killed in Gaza.
Pointing to Biden’s comment last week that Israel’s military action was “over the top”, Borrell said: “Well, if you believe that too many people are being killed, maybe you should provide less arms in order to prevent so many people have been killed.”
Netanyahu had told US broadcaster ABC News the Rafah operation would go ahead and continue until Hamas is eliminated, adding that Israel would provide “safe passage” to civilians trying to leave.
Borrell slammed an order by Netanyahu that the more than one million Palestinians sheltering in Rafah need to be “evacuated” ahead of the military operation,
“They are going to evacuate – where? To the moon? Where are they going to evacuate these people?” Borrell asked.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron has said Israel should “stop and think seriously” before taking further action in Rafah.
Cameron said many of the people in Rafah had already fled from other areas and said it is “impossible to see how you can fight a war amongst these people, there is nowhere for them to go”.
The British Prime Minister’s official spokesman said they were “deeply concerned” about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah.
About 130 of the original 250 captives taken by Hamas more than four months ago are still believed to be held in Gaza, although Israel presumes 29 of them are dead.
At least 28,340 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel’s assault on Gaza since 7 October, according to the territory’s health ministry.

"As Israel defies US to attack Rafah, where 1.4m people are trapped, what's the world's next move?","IRISH MINISTERS have not held back when asked about Israel’s bombing of the Rafah on Sunday night and prime minister’s Benjamin Netanyahu’s pledge to continue with a full ground offensive in the southern Gazan city.
Simon Coveney, Minister for Enterprise and a former foreign affairs minister,this morning accused Israel of “behaving like a rogue state”.
Yesterday, after the overnight attacks in which 100 people were killed, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin warned that thecontinued bombardment of Rafah “will constitute a war crime”.
Neve Gordon, professor of human rights law at Queen Mary University of London, believes it can be put even more bluntly.
“Rafah itself is a war crime,” says Gordon, vice-president of the British Society for Middle East Studies.
In this, the southernmost area of Gaza, an estimated 1.4m Palestinians – over half the territory’s population – are trapped. Most have fled Israel’s attacks on the north of the enclave. On one side of them there is the closed border with Egypt and on the other the swathe of Gaza subject to Israel’s active ground offensive.
In Rafah, people “do not have enough food, the sanitation is horrendous”, Gordon said.
Israel’s attacks on what was supposed to be Gaza’s last place of safety have marked a new phase in the conflict that has claimed over 28,000 Palestinians’ lives.
Even the staunchest and most powerful international allies of Israel, the US and the UK, have expressed grave concern about Netanyahu’s decision, and about the prospect of the ground offensive in Gaza pressing south into the overcrowded refugee camps of Rafah.
On Monday, US President Joe Biden urged Israel not to carry out a full-scale assault without a “credible” plan to protect people in Rafah. The idea that evacuation of Rafah’s civilians is possible has been flatly contradicted by the UN and ridiculed by the EU.
Hamas has warned that an Israeli push into Rafah will “torpedo” talks on a ceasefire and prisoner-hostage exchanges.Two Israeli hostages were freed in the operation that killed 100 Palestinians overnight.
Why is Israel ignoring its international allies?
“It seems to be to do with Netanyahu’s prospects of staying in power,” Gordon suggests.
One poll published this week indicated Netanyahu’s Likud party would hold just 18 out of the parliament’s 120 seats, with the current opposition winning 75,as reported by The Times of Israel.
Netanyahu has a corruption trial against him pending, while polling after the October 7 attacks by Hamas that killed about 1,160 Israelis indicated most citizens believe he held responsibility for failing to prevent the atrocities.
“The only way for him to stay in power is to continue with the war,” Gordon said. “I think there is something very personal going on and despite the pressure – even from [US President Joe] Biden and the EU – he’s going ahead with the attack on Rafah.”
He noted that the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza is less visible in Israel than outsiders may realise, with little about the impact of Israeli attacks on Palestinians in the mainstream press.

On Monday afternoon, the top three stories on the English language Jerusalem Post, including two about Rafah, focused on Israeli hostages.
What have the US, the EU and the UK said?
Last week, Biden and his officials made it clear that the US did not support an Israeli offensive in Rafah, with the president describing such a move as “over the top”.
Noting that Rafah was also a vital entry point for humanitarian aid into the besieged territory, a US State Department spokesman said that the operation would be “a disaster”.
On Saturday, as it became clear that troops were being mobilised, David Cameron, the UK’s Foreign Secretary, added Britain’s voice to the growing international clamour for Netanyahu to pause his plans.

Deeply concerned about the prospect of a military offensive in Rafah – over half of Gaza’s population are sheltering in the area.The priority must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out, then progress towards a sustainable, permanent ceasefire.
Yesterday, Cameron condemned Israel’s attack, urging it to “stop and think seriously before it takes any further action”.
He spoke out about the plight of the people trapped in Rafah, “many of whom have moved four, five six times before getting there”.
“It really, we think, is impossible to see how you can fight a war amongst these people, there is nowhere for them to go,” Cameron said.
They can’t go south into Egypt, they can’t go north and back to their homes because many have been destroyed.”
For the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, however, expressions of concerns ring hollow when they come from countries that supply arms to Israel.
Recalling Biden’s “over the top” comment he said: “Well, if you believe that too many people are being killed, maybe you should provide less arms in order to prevent so many people have been killed.”
The EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs also ridiculed Netanyahu’s order to his army toprepare plans to evacuateRafah’s civilian population.
“They are going to evacuate. Where? To the moon? Where are they going to evacuate these people?” Borrell said.
On Saturday, before the offensive began, Borrell warned that it would lead not only to an “unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe” but also to “grave tensions with Egypt”. Like other world leaders, he urged a suspension in hostilities.

Today, Italy’s foreign minister branded Israel’s attacks on Rafah “disproportionate”, while Germany’s foreign minister said Israel had a duty to guarantee “safe corridors” for civilians in Rafah before conducting any incursion. Germany is one of Israel’s closest allies.
What is the situation on the ground in Rafah?
Even before the offensive began the situation for Rafah’s 1.4m residents was “dire”, according to Peter Power, executive director for Ireland of Unicef, the UN’s children’s agency, which has staff on the ground in Gaza.
“There are hundreds of thousands of people living under tarpaulin sheets, some of which we have supplied, literally living from hand to mouth,” Power said.

Some of the last remaining hospitals and healthcare facilities in Gaza are in Rafah but with the local population having increased at least six fold due to the influx of displaced people, these are under enormous strain.

“If they were to be destroyed or damaged the repercussions would be phenomenal,” Power said.
“There are so many people in hospitals, UN shelters and schools. We are appealing to all parties to adhere to their obligations under international law and not target these facilities.”
Any military operation in such a densely populated residential area “will have indiscriminate effects on innocent women and children”, Power adds.
How can the world respond and can a truce be reached?
Gordon believes the “only prospect” of Israel changing course is a threat of sanction from “the EU or US – one is enough”.
“There has to be a certain kind of executive enforcement power otherwise Israel will do as its prime minister wants it to do,” Gordon said.
“What [the US and UK] needs to be doing is saying, ‘if you do not suspend hostilities, that’s it with our economic aid, with our weapons trade’. The minute they say that it’s over and there’ll be a ceasefire.”
On Monday, after talks in Washington with the King of Jordon, Biden insisted the US was working on a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas which would “bring an immediate and sustained period of calm into Gaza” during which a more permanent ceasefire could be agreed.
As international pressure for a truce grows, talks are underway in Cairo today involving the heads of the CIA and Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, as well as Qatar’s Prime Minister. Egypt and Qatar have been mediating between Israel and Hamas with US support.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has called on the UN Security Council to intervene over Rafah.
While the council can institute sanctions, the US has used its permanent members veto repeatedly to protect Israel. Nevertheless Saudi Arabia’s submission – which will gain widespread support from other countries – is “extremely important if only to show the double standards of the US”, Gordon said.
Israel’s ongoing campaign in Gaza comes less than three weeks after the International Court of Justice warned Israel to do everything within its power to prevent genocide against Palestinians. This morning, Coveney accused Israel of flouting the ICJ’s demands.
The International Criminal Court is also watching closely. On Monday, the court’s prosecutor said he was “deeply concerned” by the potential ground incursion by Israeli forces in Rafah.
“All wars have rules and the laws applicable to armed conflict cannot be interpreted so as to render them hollow or devoid of meaning,” said Karim Khan, adding that “those who are in breach of the law will be held accountable”.

Israel kills 'around 100' people in strikes on Rafah while recovering two hostages,"LAST UPDATE|12 Feb

PREDAWN ISRAELI STRIKES in the southern Gaza city of Rafah killed dozens of people today, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
“Around 100″ people have been killed in the strikes on the city along the Egyptian border and 14 houses and three mosques were hit.
Israel has announced that it recovered two hostages in the city during the strikes.
Fernando Simon Marman, 60, and Louis Har, 70, were rescued amid an intense firefight and heavy airstrikes, then airlifted to a hospital where they were declared in good health despite more than four months in captivity.
Har’s son-in-law praised the rescue of the Argentinian-Israeli men and described an emotional reunion in a hospital near Tel Aviv as “a lot of tears, hugs, not many words”.
“Luckily for us, as a family, they were saved tonight. But I must say that the job is not done,” said Idan Bejerano. “We are happy today, but we didn’t win. It’s just another step towards bringing [back] all the other [hostages].”
The Israeli army is preparing for a ground incursion into the teeming city along the border with Egypt, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from fighting further north.
About 1.4 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, with many living in tents, while food, water and medicine are becoming increasingly scarce.
The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned what it called a “massacre” in Rafah last night and accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of “a mentality of revenge”.

The precarious humanitarian situation in Rafah has prompted aid groups and foreign governments, including Israel’s key ally the United States, to express deep concern over the potentially disastrous consequences of expanding operations there.

Riham Jafari of ActionAid told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that people are living in increasingly overcrowded conditions.
“Each toilet is shared by hundreds of people,” she said.
“Pregnant women are forced to give birth unsheltered, without medical care.”
She highlighted that there are now also fewer avenues for humanitarian aid to get through the border, and a full ground invasion would make deliveries “impossible”.
During the 7 October attacks, Palestinian militants seized about 250 hostages, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel says around 130 are still in Gaza, though 29 are thought to be dead.
Dozens of hostages were freed by Hamas during a one-week truce in November that also saw the release of more than 200 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
Since then, Netanyahu has faced mounting protests and even calls for early elections, with relatives of the hostages frustrated over the pace of the rescues.
Renewed talks for a pause in the fighting have been held in Cairo, with Hamas open to a fresh ceasefire including more prisoner-hostage exchanges, but a Hamas leader told AFP on condition of anonymity that an Israeli push into Rafah “would torpedo the exchange negotiations”.
The group’s military wing yesterday said two hostages had been killed and eight others seriously wounded in Israeli bombardment in recent days, a claim AFP was unable to independently verify.
AFP journalists and witnesses heard an intense series of strikes and saw smoke billowing above the city, which now hosts more than half of Gaza’s total population after they fled bombardment elsewhere in the Strip.
The Israeli military said it had “conducted a series of strikes on terror targets in the area of Shaboura in the southern Gaza Strip”, adding that the strikes had concluded.
A firefight broke out as the hostages were being taken out of the building they were held in, an Israeli army spokesperson said, with air strikes targeting nearby buildings where shots were fired.
“Many terrorists were killed this evening during this operation and one of our fighters was slightly injured,” he said.

A spokesperson from the prime minister’s office said the Israeli “forces went up to the second floor of a building in Rafah, broke open the locked building door with an explosive device, shot at nearby points and successfully rescued the abductees”.
“At this point, fire was opened from the building and nearby buildings, and a prolonged battle took place, during which dozens of Hamas targets were attacked from the air in order to allow the force to leave the building.”
“Many terrorists were killed,” said army spokesman Daniel Hagari.
US President Joe Biden spoke to Netanyahu by phone yesterday and told him the Rafah advance should not go ahead in the absence of a “credible” plan to ensure “the safety” of people sheltering there, the White House said.
Haaretz has reported that Biden supposedly called the Israeli premier an “asshole” on at least three occasions over his lack of willingness to work towards a ceasefire.
Netanyahu had told US broadcaster ABC News the Rafah operation would go ahead until Hamas was eliminated, adding he would provide “safe passage” to civilians wishing to leave.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been among countries that have voiced alarm over the looming Rafah incursion and warned against a “forced” displacement of Palestinians.
Riyadh called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting, while Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the priority “must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out”.
When pressed about where they could go, Netanyahu said: “You know, the areas that we’ve cleared north of Rafah, plenty of areas there. But, we are working out a detailed plan.”
Israel has put a visa ban on the United Nations special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories over recent comments denying the 7 October attack was “anti-Semitic”.
The UN-appointed independent expert, Francesca Albanese, last week said she disagreed with French President Emmanuel Macron’s description of the attack.
“No”, Albanese wrote in French on social media platform X. “The victims of 7/10 were not killed because of their Jewishness but in response to Israeli oppression.”","6.40am, 12 Feb 2024",,
The EU's Israel-Gaza response has been poor according to two-thirds of Irish voters,"THE EUROPEAN UNION’S standing has been damaged among three-in-four Irish young people as a result of the bloc’s response to the current conflict in Gaza.
In the first poll on voting preferences and sentiment ahead of June’s European elections,The Journal/Ireland Thinks found that those surveyed across all aged groups were markedly unsatisfied with the EU’s handling of the conflict.
The response of EU leadership figures to the deadly 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel and the death and destruction in Gaza that has followed has sparked tensions among different member states.
In the day’s following the Hamas attack, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the European Union stood with Israel “today and in the days to come” and “in the next weeks”.
Her comments and her subsequent trip to Israel were judged by some, including Irish MEPs, to be akin to givingunconditional support to military action.
Following an EU Council meeting in December, the summitended without a decision to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, despite the urging of Ireland and some other nations.
The disconnect between the wider view in the EU and the view of Irish voters is reflected in this latest poll.

When asked to rate on a scale from1-5(1 being ‘very bad’ and 5 being ‘very good’) how they rated the EU’s performance on Israel/Gaza, by far the most popular selection (44%) was1.
The average rating across all voters was2.
Only11%gave a score (4 or 5) which would be categorised as positive while negative marks made up two-thirds of those surveyed. Those who landed in the middle at3made up22%of respondents.

As well as rating the EU’s performance on the issue, a separate question also probed whether their “view of the EU had changed since the escalation of the conflict”.
In response to that question, over half (51%) say their opinion of the EU had either ‘somewhat disimproved’ or ‘much disimproved’.
The largest single cohort, at43%, however said that their opinion of the EU had not changed as a result of the conflict.
The polling also provides a breakdown of responses across a number of different categories, including age and party allegiance, and shows noteworthy differences across different age groups.
Among 18-34 year-olds,75%of those surveyed said that their views on the EU have disimproved as a result of the conflict. By comparison, the corresponding figure among the 45-54 age group was45%.
In terms of party allegiance, the highest average rating for the EU’s performance on the conflict came from Fine Gael voters, who rated the performance at2.7out of 5.
The lowest rating was from Solidarity-PBP voters at1.2, whereas the average rating across all voters was2.

Ukraine

The poll also gauged sentiment on a number of other issues relevant to the upcoming EU elections, with those surveyed asked about Ukraine’s application to join the EU and the prospect of that application being fast-tracked.
There was overall enthusiasm for Ukraine’s membership, with72%being in favour, a figure that’s made up of33%favouring a fast-tracked application and39%favouring a regular application.
One in five people (20%) were not in favour of Ukraine’s membership of the EU, but again there were some noteworthy numbers based on a voter’s party affiliation.
Over half of Aontú voters (57%) were opposed to Ukraine’s membership of the EU, with Independent voters (48%) and Solidarity-PBP voters (48%) also largely opposed to Kyiv’s application.
Climate
Respondents were asked to rate the EU’s performance on the response to the climate emergency on the same 1-5 rating system, with the overall average rating coming in at2.8.
That average score was relatively consistent across the age groups, with a score of3the most popular selection across all six age ranges.
Big tech
As the EU’s HQ for many of the world’s biggest tech firms, Ireland has a particular interest in how the EU plans to regulate the industry.
There have been, for example, effortsby the EU to restrict Meta from using personal dataand moves by theEU to investigate disinformation on X, formerly Twitter.
Asked in the poll to rate the EU’s performance on reigning in big tech, only22%of respondents gave a positive score.
The average score across all age groups was2.6, with younger people aged 18-34 giving an above average score of2.8.
Enthusiasm to vote

Overall there appears to be a motivation among those polled to vote in the European elections, with83%saying they were very likely to do so,12%saying they were somewhat likely and only5%saying they were unlikely to.
Among those poll, 35-44 years olds were the most enthusiastic likely voters, with90%saying they were very likely to vote.
The Journal/Ireland Thinks series of polls will run each month ahead of the European parliament elections in June. It will continue to explore voter intentions, measure Irish public sentiment towards the EU on a number of issues and highlight any potential opinion gaps between different demographics of Irish society on matters important to them.
The poll of 1,255 people was carried out between the 2 and 7 February and has a  margin of error of 2.8%.

“Around 100″ people have been killed in the strikes on the city along the Egyptian border and 14 houses and three mosques were hit.
Israel has announced that it recovered two hostages in the city during the strikes.
Fernando Simon Marman, 60, and Louis Har, 70, were rescued amid an intense firefight and heavy airstrikes, then airlifted to a hospital where they were declared in good health despite more than four months in captivity.
Har’s son-in-law praised the rescue of the Argentinian-Israeli men and described an emotional reunion in a hospital near Tel Aviv as “a lot of tears, hugs, not many words”.
“Luckily for us, as a family, they were saved tonight. But I must say that the job is not done,” said Idan Bejerano. “We are happy today, but we didn’t win. It’s just another step towards bringing [back] all the other [hostages].”
The Israeli army is preparing for a ground incursion into the teeming city along the border with Egypt, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge from fighting further north.
About 1.4 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, with many living in tents, while food, water and medicine are becoming increasingly scarce.
The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned what it called a “massacre” in Rafah last night and accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of “a mentality of revenge”.

The precarious humanitarian situation in Rafah has prompted aid groups and foreign governments, including Israel’s key ally the United States, to express deep concern over the potentially disastrous consequences of expanding operations there.

Riham Jafari of ActionAid told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that people are living in increasingly overcrowded conditions.
“Each toilet is shared by hundreds of people,” she said.
“Pregnant women are forced to give birth unsheltered, without medical care.”
She highlighted that there are now also fewer avenues for humanitarian aid to get through the border, and a full ground invasion would make deliveries “impossible”.
During the 7 October attacks, Palestinian militants seized about 250 hostages, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel says around 130 are still in Gaza, though 29 are thought to be dead.
Dozens of hostages were freed by Hamas during a one-week truce in November that also saw the release of more than 200 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
Since then, Netanyahu has faced mounting protests and even calls for early elections, with relatives of the hostages frustrated over the pace of the rescues.
Renewed talks for a pause in the fighting have been held in Cairo, with Hamas open to a fresh ceasefire including more prisoner-hostage exchanges, but a Hamas leader told AFP on condition of anonymity that an Israeli push into Rafah “would torpedo the exchange negotiations”.
The group’s military wing yesterday said two hostages had been killed and eight others seriously wounded in Israeli bombardment in recent days, a claim AFP was unable to independently verify.
AFP journalists and witnesses heard an intense series of strikes and saw smoke billowing above the city, which now hosts more than half of Gaza’s total population after they fled bombardment elsewhere in the Strip.
The Israeli military said it had “conducted a series of strikes on terror targets in the area of Shaboura in the southern Gaza Strip”, adding that the strikes had concluded.
A firefight broke out as the hostages were being taken out of the building they were held in, an Israeli army spokesperson said, with air strikes targeting nearby buildings where shots were fired.
“Many terrorists were killed this evening during this operation and one of our fighters was slightly injured,” he said.

A spokesperson from the prime minister’s office said the Israeli “forces went up to the second floor of a building in Rafah, broke open the locked building door with an explosive device, shot at nearby points and successfully rescued the abductees”.
“At this point, fire was opened from the building and nearby buildings, and a prolonged battle took place, during which dozens of Hamas targets were attacked from the air in order to allow the force to leave the building.”
“Many terrorists were killed,” said army spokesman Daniel Hagari.
US President Joe Biden spoke to Netanyahu by phone yesterday and told him the Rafah advance should not go ahead in the absence of a “credible” plan to ensure “the safety” of people sheltering there, the White House said.
Haaretz has reported that Biden supposedly called the Israeli premier an “asshole” on at least three occasions over his lack of willingness to work towards a ceasefire.
Netanyahu had told US broadcaster ABC News the Rafah operation would go ahead until Hamas was eliminated, adding he would provide “safe passage” to civilians wishing to leave.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been among countries that have voiced alarm over the looming Rafah incursion and warned against a “forced” displacement of Palestinians.
Riyadh called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting, while Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the priority “must be an immediate pause in the fighting to get aid in and hostages out”.
When pressed about where they could go, Netanyahu said: “You know, the areas that we’ve cleared north of Rafah, plenty of areas there. But, we are working out a detailed plan.”
Israel has put a visa ban on the United Nations special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories over recent comments denying the 7 October attack was “anti-Semitic”.
The UN-appointed independent expert, Francesca Albanese, last week said she disagreed with French President Emmanuel Macron’s description of the attack.
“No”, Albanese wrote in French on social media platform X. “The victims of 7/10 were not killed because of their Jewishness but in response to Israeli oppression.”","6.40am, 12 Feb 2024",,
The EU's Israel-Gaza response has been poor according to two-thirds of Irish voters,"THE EUROPEAN UNION’S standing has been damaged among three-in-four Irish young people as a result of the bloc’s response to the current conflict in Gaza.
In the first poll on voting preferences and sentiment ahead of June’s European elections,The Journal/Ireland Thinks found that those surveyed across all aged groups were markedly unsatisfied with the EU’s handling of the conflict.
The response of EU leadership figures to the deadly 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel and the death and destruction in Gaza that has followed has sparked tensions among different member states.
In the day’s following the Hamas attack, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the European Union stood with Israel “today and in the days to come” and “in the next weeks”.
Her comments and her subsequent trip to Israel were judged by some, including Irish MEPs, to be akin to givingunconditional support to military action.
Following an EU Council meeting in December, the summitended without a decision to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, despite the urging of Ireland and some other nations.
The disconnect between the wider view in the EU and the view of Irish voters is reflected in this latest poll.

When asked to rate on a scale from1-5(1 being ‘very bad’ and 5 being ‘very good’) how they rated the EU’s performance on Israel/Gaza, by far the most popular selection (44%) was1.
The average rating across all voters was2.
Only11%gave a score (4 or 5) which would be categorised as positive while negative marks made up two-thirds of those surveyed. Those who landed in the middle at3made up22%of respondents.

As well as rating the EU’s performance on the issue, a separate question also probed whether their “view of the EU had changed since the escalation of the conflict”.
In response to that question, over half (51%) say their opinion of the EU had either ‘somewhat disimproved’ or ‘much disimproved’.
The largest single cohort, at43%, however said that their opinion of the EU had not changed as a result of the conflict.
The polling also provides a breakdown of responses across a number of different categories, including age and party allegiance, and shows noteworthy differences across different age groups.
Among 18-34 year-olds,75%of those surveyed said that their views on the EU have disimproved as a result of the conflict. By comparison, the corresponding figure among the 45-54 age group was45%.
In terms of party allegiance, the highest average rating for the EU’s performance on the conflict came from Fine Gael voters, who rated the performance at2.7out of 5.
The lowest rating was from Solidarity-PBP voters at1.2, whereas the average rating across all voters was2.

Ukraine

The poll also gauged sentiment on a number of other issues relevant to the upcoming EU elections, with those surveyed asked about Ukraine’s application to join the EU and the prospect of that application being fast-tracked.
There was overall enthusiasm for Ukraine’s membership, with72%being in favour, a figure that’s made up of33%favouring a fast-tracked application and39%favouring a regular application.
One in five people (20%) were not in favour of Ukraine’s membership of the EU, but again there were some noteworthy numbers based on a voter’s party affiliation.
Over half of Aontú voters (57%) were opposed to Ukraine’s membership of the EU, with Independent voters (48%) and Solidarity-PBP voters (48%) also largely opposed to Kyiv’s application.
Climate
Respondents were asked to rate the EU’s performance on the response to the climate emergency on the same 1-5 rating system, with the overall average rating coming in at2.8.
That average score was relatively consistent across the age groups, with a score of3the most popular selection across all six age ranges.
Big tech
As the EU’s HQ for many of the world’s biggest tech firms, Ireland has a particular interest in how the EU plans to regulate the industry.
There have been, for example, effortsby the EU to restrict Meta from using personal dataand moves by theEU to investigate disinformation on X, formerly Twitter.
Asked in the poll to rate the EU’s performance on reigning in big tech, only22%of respondents gave a positive score.
The average score across all age groups was2.6, with younger people aged 18-34 giving an above average score of2.8.
Enthusiasm to vote

Overall there appears to be a motivation among those polled to vote in the European elections, with83%saying they were very likely to do so,12%saying they were somewhat likely and only5%saying they were unlikely to.
Among those poll, 35-44 years olds were the most enthusiastic likely voters, with90%saying they were very likely to vote.
The Journal/Ireland Thinks series of polls will run each month ahead of the European parliament elections in June. It will continue to explore voter intentions, measure Irish public sentiment towards the EU on a number of issues and highlight any potential opinion gaps between different demographics of Irish society on matters important to them.
The poll of 1,255 people was carried out between the 2 and 7 February and has a  margin of error of 2.8%.

World leaders and Hamas warn Israel to call off plans to stage ground offensive in Rafah,"HAMAS AND INTERNATIONAL governments have warned Israel against launching a ground invasion in Rafah, the southern border city where around half of Gaza’s displaced population has fled to as they try to escape Israel’s attacks.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered troops to “prepare to operate” in Rafah, where it claims Hamas’ remaining strongholds are located.
Israel initially focused its attacks on Gaza since October in northern areas, telling civilians to evacuate towards the south, but has turned to bombing southern cities like Khan Younis and Rafah, killing refugees who had fled from the north.
Around half of Gaza’s 2.3 million population are now refugees in Rafah, which has a border crossing with Egypt. The displaced Palestinians are living in dire conditions, with humanitarian organisations urgently emphasising the lack of access to food, water, healthcare and sanitation.
A Hamas spokesperson has today said that “any attack by the occupation army on the city of Rafah would undermine the exchange negotiations”.
Many other countries, including Ireland but also the United States, a key ally for Israel, have spoken out against Israel’s plans to move into Rafah.
Tánaiste Micheál Martin said yesterday that plans to expand operations in Rafah and evacuate the civilian population “pose a grave threat” to the refugees sheltering in the area and must be condemned.
He said a military operation in Rafah would entail “grave violations” of international humanitarian law and that it is “absolutely clear that ordering the evacuation of 1.5 million people, who have nowhere safe to go, risks mass forced displacement”.
The US State Department said it does not support a ground operation in Rafah and that such an operation risks “disaster”.

The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation have all publicly condemned the plan, with the 57-country OIC saying Israel’s actions are “part of rejected attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people from their land”.
Saudi Arabia has called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting while German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wrote on social media that “the people in Gaza cannot disappear into thin air”.
Talks for a pause in the fighting were held recently in Cairo. Hamas has indicated it is open to a ceasefire and is seeking the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel in exchange for freeing hostages in Gaza.
Egypt has been a key site in facilitating mediation between the two sides. Its foreign minister Sameh Shoukry said that a ground offensive in Rafah would have “disastrous consequences” – and, fearing Israel will try to force Palestinians out of Gaza and into Egypt, that any such movement would threaten the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
In the early hours of yesterday morning, three air strikes on homes in Rafah killed 28 people, according to a health official and Associated Press journalists who saw the bodies being brought to hospitals. 10 of the deceased were children. The youngest was three months old.
Later yesterday, an Israeli air strike on a home in Rafah killed at least 11 people, including three children, according to Ahmed al-Sawaf, the head of the Rafah municipality.
Netanyahu’s government is facing protests within Israel over his failure to secure the return of hostages and accusations that he is elongating the duration of the war.
“It’s clear Netanyahu is dragging out the war. He has no idea what to do on the day after,” one protester, Gil Gordon, said in Tel Aviv.
“We know the people are with us, but we don’t feel the government is,” said Efrat Machikwa, the niece of one of the hostages, Gadi Mozes.
“The army makes pressure, but unfortunately this doesn’t bring the hostages back alive,” said Einav Peretz, 34.

Tánaiste condemns order given to Israeli troops to 'prepare to operate' in Rafah,"LAST UPDATE|10 Feb
THE TÁNAISTE HAS said that Israel encroaching on Rafah would “entail grave violations of international humanitarian law”.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered troops to “prepare to operate” in Rafah, the southern border city where thousands and thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled.
Israel initially focused its attacks on Gaza since October in northern areas, telling civilians to evacuate towards the south, but has turned to bombing southern cities like Khan Younis and Rafah, killing refugees who had fled from the north.
Around half of Gaza’s 2.3 million population are now refugees in Rafah, which has a border crossing with Egypt.
More than a million displaced Palestinians are sleeping in tents and living in dire conditions in the city.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told military officials to submit to the government Cabinet a “combined plan for evacuating the population and destroying the battalions” in Rafah.
However, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said that expanding military operations in Rafah and the orders to evacuate the civilian population “pose a grave threat” to the refugees sheltering in the area and must be condemned.
“It is also absolutely clear that ordering the evacuation of 1.5 million people, who have nowhere safe to go, risks mass forced displacement.”
Martin said that must not be allowed to happen and that all countries, including all EU member states, must demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.

At least 110 people were killed in overnight attacks, including 25 in strikes in Rafah, according to Gaza’s health ministry.

The previous day, three children were killed in a strike in Rafah, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.
The US State Department has said it does not support a ground operation in Rafah and that such an operation risks “disaster”.
“I’m of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in Gaza, in the Gaza Strip, has been over the top,” US president Joe Biden said – a sign of rising tensions between Israel and its key ally.
“There are a lot of innocent people who are starving… in trouble and dying, and it’s got to stop.”
President Michael D. Higgins issued a statement last week warning that if Israel continued to strike areas densely populated with refugees, it would “leave any respect for humanitarian law in tatters”.
President Higgins said that “what is at stake now, given the high proportion of loss of life of non-combatants, and particularly of women and children, is the potential emptying out of the entire space and discourse of human rights and international humanitarian law”.
Doctors Without Borders has said a ground invasion in Rafah would be “catastrophic and must not proceed”.
“There is no place that is safe in Gaza and no way for people to leave,” the organisation said.
Israeli forces raided Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis yesterday after a weeks-long siege that involved “intense artillery shelling and heavy gunfire”.
MSF said said Israeli forces arrested eight of its team members at the hospital, including “four doctors, as well as four wounded individuals and five patients’ companions”.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he still sees “space for agreement to be reached” on a deal to call of fighting and release hostages, even after Netanyahu rejected what he labelled Hamas’s “bizarre demands”.
Hamas negotiators left Cairo yesterday after what a Hamas source described as “positive and good discussions” with Egyptian and Qatari mediators.

US warns Israel of 'disaster' if it sends troops into Gaza's Rafah city,"LAST UPDATE|8 Feb

THE UNITED STATES has warned that Israel risks “disaster” if it sends troops into Gaza’s far-southern city of Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians have sought refuge.
The warning came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered troops to “prepare to operate” in Rafah, the last major urban area in the Gaza Strip Israeli ground troops have yet to enter.
Israel’s armed forces stepped up its air strikes on the city on Thursday as fears of ground fighting grew among the hundreds of thousands of civilians displaced from other parts of Gaza who are now sheltering in tents and bombed out buildings.
State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said Washington had “yet to see any evidence of serious planning” for a Rafah ground operation.
Noting that Rafah is also a crucial entry point for humanitarian aid destined for Gaza, Patel said such an assault was “not something we’d support”.
“To conduct such an operation right now with no planning and little thought… would be a disaster.”
Secretary of State Antony Blinken conveyed Washington’s concerns to Netanyahu directly during their talks yesterday in Jerusalem, Patel said.

Publicly, the US top diplomat warned that any “military operation that Israel undertakes needs to put civilians first and foremost.”
Blinken left Israel without securing a pause in fighting, wrapping up his fifth crisis tour of the Middle East since the war started.
UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that a military push into Rafah “would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare”.
AFP journalists reported that Israel carried out at least seven air strikes overnight in the Rafah area, terrifying civilians crowded into shelters and makeshift camps.
“These strikes are proof there is no safety in Rafah,” said resident Umm Hassan, 48, whose home was damaged in the shelling of the nearby house of a local police chief.
“Look at the residential unit they just blew up,” he said. “Regarding Netanyahu’s threat to invade Rafah, we are people of faith. We are not worried. Life is one and God is one.”
Strikes and ground combat continued across the Hamas-ruled territory, now in its fifth month of war, where the health ministry said another 130 people were killed in 24 hours.
Cairo truce talks
Blinken ended his fifth tour of the region, where US forces have been drawn into related conflicts from Iraq to Yemen.

On the ceasefire talks, Blinken insisted he still saw “space for agreement to be reached” to halt the fighting and bring home hostages.
Egypt was set to host new talks with Qatari and Hamas negotiators hoping to achieve “calm” in Gaza and a prisoner-hostage exchange, an Egyptian official said.
The Israeli prime minister had rejected what he labelled Hamas’s “bizarre demands” in the talks.
Blinken told reporters that Hamas’s counter-proposal had at least offered an opportunity “to pursue negotiations”.
“While there are some clear non-starters in Hamas’s response, we do think it creates space for agreement to be reached, and we will work at that relentlessly until we get there,” he said.
Hamas said a delegation led by Khalil al-Hayya, a leading member of the group’s political bureau, was travelling to Cairo.
A Gaza-based Palestinian official close to the militant group later told AFP: “We expect the negotiations to be very complex and difficult.
“But Hamas is open to discussions and the movement is keen to reach a ceasefire,” added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.","8.27am, 8 Feb 2024",,
Qatar says Hamas response to new Gaza truce proposal is 'positive',"LAST UPDATE|6 Feb
THE PRIME MINISTER of Qatar has said that Hamas’s response to a proposed new truce to free hostages in return for pausing the conflict in Gaza is “positive”.
It comes as the Palestinian health ministry said heavy strikes and fighting in Gaza killed at least 107 people in the last 24 hours.
The truce deal, which US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will take to Israel, proposes a six-week pause to fighting as Hamas frees hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and more aid enters Gaza, according to a Hamas source.
“We have received a reply from Hamas with regards to the general framework of the agreement with regards to hostages. The reply includes some comments, but in general it is positive,” Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said after meeting Blinken in Doha.
The proposed truce deal was hashed out in Paris during talks with Israel, Egypt and the CIA. The Qatari prime minister, who took part in the talks, said he was “optimistic” but declined to discuss the Hamas reply in detail, citing the “sensitivity of the circumstances”.
Hamas confirmed that it submitted its response to Egypt and Qatar.
Blinken, on his fifth regional tour since the current conflict began, said that he would discuss the proposal tomorrow in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced pressure from hardliners against perceived concessions to Hamas.
“There’s still a lot of work to be done. But we continue to believe that an agreement is possible and indeed essential, and we will continue to work relentlessly to achieve it,” Blinken said.

The US envoy earlier met Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo, a day after he held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh.
Blinken and Sisi “discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of all hostages held by Hamas,” said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.
He also “expressed appreciation for Egypt’s leadership role in facilitating the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza”, Miller said.
Israeli troops, with air and naval support, have been engaged in heavy combat centred on Gaza’s main southern city of Khan Younis, the hometown of Hamas’s Gaza chief, Yahya Sinwar, much of which has been reduced to rubble.
Israel accuses Sinwar of masterminding the 7 October attack, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also seized around 250 hostages. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza, including 28 who are believed to have been killed.
Israel’s military campaign has killed at least 27,585 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.

The army said today that “over the past day, dozens of terrorists have been killed and approximately 80 individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity have been apprehended, including a number of terrorists that took part in the October 7 massacre”.
“No place is safe, no place at all – where shall we go?” one Palestinian, Mohamad Kozaat, said after six members of his family were wounded in an Israeli strike on Rafah.
Around 8,000 displaced people were evacuated from the besieged Al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis, where they had sought refuge, after weeks of heavy shelling and fighting nearby.
A spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said the organisation was told that the Al-Amal hospital, run by the Palestinian Red Crescent (PRCS), had been largely emptied following a lengthy siege by Israeli forces.
“The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is beyond catastrophic,” Tommaso Della Longa told reporters in Geneva.
“Eight thousand internally displaced people who sought refuge in our Palestinian Red Crescent hospital in Khan Yunis … left the hospital yesterday.”
Della Longa said the hospital was hit several times, including on Friday, when a PRCS volunteer was killed. Around 100 elderly, wounded and disabled patients remain there, with about 100 staff and volunteers, the ICRC said.
Della Longa said that Al-Amal had faced immense challenges, such as dire shortages of medicines, food and water, even before it was evacuated.

The United Nations humanitarian monitors said that Israel’s evacuation orders in Gaza now cover two-thirds of the region’s land.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced in Gaza since October because of the fighting and Israel’s expanding evacuation orders.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has said in its latest daily report on the humanitarian situation in Gaza that intense Israeli bombardment by land, sea and air is being reported across much of the Strip, resulting in civilian casualties, displacement, and destruction of civilian infrastructure.
More than half of Gaza’s population, which stood at 2.3 million people before the war, is now packed into the town of Rafah near the border crossing with Egypt and surrounding areas, according to the OCHA.
Unicef has reported that most newly displaced people have only 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day for drinking, cooking and washing.
Israel initially focused its attacks on Gaza in northern areas, telling civilians to evacuate towards the south, but has turned to bombing southern cities like Khan Younis and Rafah, killing refugees who had fled from the north.
The areas affected by evacuation orders was home to 1.78 million Palestinians, or 67% of Gaza’s population.
Yesterday, Israeli gunfire hit a food convoy waiting to enter northern Gaza, according to aUN official.

Blinken arrives in Saudi Arabia for another Middle East tour a bid to secure Israel-Hamas truce,"LAST UPDATE|5 Feb
US SECRETARY OF State Antony Blinken has landed in Saudi Arabia to kick off his latest regional crisis trip aimed at securing a new truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict.
The top US diplomat’s plane touched down in Riyadh, according to an AFP journalist travelling with him.
This is Blinken’s his fifth trip to the region since Hamas’s 7 October attack that triggered the fighting. He is also due to visit Israel, Egypt and Qatar.
Ahead of the trip, Blinken stressed the need for “urgently addressing humanitarian needs in Gaza”, after aid groups have repeatedly sounded the alarm over the devastating impact nearly four months of war have had on the besieged Gaza Strip.
“The situation is indescribable,” said Said Hamouda, a Palestinian who fled his home to the southern Gaza city of Rafah on the border with Egypt.
With Blinken arriving in the region, he is expected to discuss a proposed truce thrashed out in a Paris meeting in January of top US, Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials.
The diplomatic push has become more urgent with the surge in attacks across the region by Iran-backed groups in solidarity with Hamas,triggering counterattacks by the United States.
The proposed truce would pause fighting for an initial six weeks as Hamas frees hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, according to a Hamas source.
Hamas has said no agreement has yet been reached, while some Israeli officials have expressed opposition to any perceived concessions.
At least 27,365 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s offensive, according to the territory’s health ministry.

Blinken’s trip comes as Israel has in recent days pressed further south towards the southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt, warning that its ground forces could advance on Rafah as part of the campaign to eradicate Hamas.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said “a complete victory will deal a fatal blow” to Hamas but also to other Iran-backed militant groups across the region.
Rafah now hosts more than half of Gaza’s population, displaced due to Israel’s assault.
This morning, sources told AFP they could hear artillery shelling in the areas of eastern Rafah and Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s main city.
Israel says Khan Younis is where militants prepared for the 7 October attack, and that high-ranking Hamas officials are hiding there.
At least 128 people, mostly women and children, were killed in Israeli strikes overnight in the besieged territory, according to the Gaza health ministry.
Gazans have faced dire humanitarian conditions, and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X that “there is very limited access to clean water and sanitation amid relentless bombardment”.

UNRWA itselfis facing a major controversyafter accusations that 12 staff members were involved in Hamas’s October 7 attack.
More than a dozen countries, led by the United States, suspended their funding to the agency after the claims surfaced.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has saidIreland is not planning to suspend fundingto the Agency following the allegations.
Spain has said it would give an additional €3.5 million “so that UNRWA can maintain its activities in the short term”, said Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares.

UN chief Antonio Guterres announced the creation of an independent panel to assess UNRWA and “whether the agency is doing everything within its power to ensure neutrality”, a UN statement said.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II urged donors to maintain support for the agency “to allow it to provide its vital humanitarian services… particularly in light of the tragic humanitarian situation in Gaza”, a royal statement said.
In a meeting with Emirati President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Amman, the two leaders urged the protection of civilians in Gaza and called to intensify efforts towards a lasting ceasefire and a “political solution” to the conflict, the statement said.
French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne, on his first visit to the region since taking office, said peace will only be achieved through diplomacy, urging the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks “without delay”.
Before departing for the region, Blinken said that the humanitarian crisis would be one of his focuses.
“Urgently addressing humanitarian needs in Gaza and advancing stability in the Middle East are priorities we share with Saudi Arabia,” Blinken said he told Saudi foreign minister Faisal bin Farhan.
Blinken’s latest Middle East visit comes as Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir told the Wall Street Journal that its key ally has not shown sufficient support.
“Instead of giving us his full backing, (US President Joe) Biden is busy with giving humanitarian aid and fuel (to Gaza), which goes to Hamas,” he said in an article published yesterday.
His outburst came after Washington imposed sanctions on four settlers amid rising violence against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, saying: “I don’t need help to know how to navigate our relations with the US and the international community, while standing firm on our national interests.”

President Higgins warns of 'moment of global crisis' as Israel strikes refugee-dense southern Gaza,"PRESIDENT MICHAEL D. Higgins has decried Israel’s strikes in southern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled from further north, calling the prospect of more violence a ‘moment of global crisis’.
The president received an update last night in a phone call from Dr Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation, who detailed the dire situation in Gaza as the recorded death toll since October passes 27,000.
Israel initially focused its attacks on Gaza in northern areas, telling civilians to evacuate towards the south, but has turned to bombing southern cities like Khan Younis and Rafah, killing refugees who had fled from the north.
President Higgins has said that any further strikes on areas densely populated with refugees would “leave any respect for humanitarian law in tatters”.
In total, 75% of Gaza’s population has been displaced. The health system has collapsed and more than half a million people are facing hunger and starvation, according to the WHO.
70% of people who have been killed in Gaza to date are women and children, with a further 17,000 children now without their parents.
“Given all of these facts, any further extension of the bombing campaign into what is a densely populated area to which so many people have fled would leave any respect for humanitarian law in tatters,” President Higgins said.
“The suggestion that such a development take place and be watched in near silence is a suggestion that removes all morality from any stated position of public concern for the most basic of human rights.”
The president said that “what is at stake now, given the high proportion of loss of life of non-combatants, and particularly of women and children, is the potential emptying out of the entire space and discourse of human rights and international humanitarian law”.

He said that beyond a ceasefire, which he described as being immediately necessary, and the release of hostages and provision of humanitarian supports, there must serious discussions about a meaningful long-term resolution that can “provide peace and security to both the people of Palestine and the people of Israel” – adding that this must include the recognition of a Palestinian State.
Gaza’s health ministry said more than 100 people were killed in strikes overnight, with 105 killed the night before.
Rafah, which has a border crossing with Egypt, formerly had a population of 200,000 but is now holding more than half of Gaza’s total population of over two million, according to the WHO.
President Higgins called for countries that have suspended funding to the UNRWA, the United Nations’s agency for Palestinian refugees, to resume it urgently.
12 of the agency’s staff members have been accused by Israel of aiding Hamas in its attacks on 7 October, prompting the UN to open an investigation.
Several countries, including the US and UK, consequently suspended their funding to the agency – which was already pushed to the brink due to the tremendous need for its services in Gaza.
President Higgins said it is “vital” that countries continue to support the UNRWA, which has 13,000 staff members in Gaza who are “assisting some of the most broken people on the planet in the most devastating of circumstances”.
“The small number of those suspected of being connected to the appalling atrocities carried out by Hamas on 7 October have correctly been dealt with,” the president said, adding that other countries should now follow Ireland’s example and restore their funding for the UNRWA.
“Those countries who have removed their funding from UNRWA must be reminded of the unavoidable consequences their actions are likely to have on this most vulnerable. This is not a matter on which anyone who believes in the vital need for a humanitarian response can remain silent.”
152 UNRWA staff have died in Gaza.

Irish basketball team did not shake hands with Israeli team after being accused of antisemitism,"LAST UPDATE|8 Feb
THE IRISH TEAM did not shake hands or engage in the “traditional pre-match arrangements” with Israel ahead of this afternoon’s FIBA Women’s EuroBasket 2025 Qualifier following accusations of “antisemitism”.
The game was originally due to take place in Israel on 9 November 2023, but waspostponed due to the conflict in the regionand later rescheduled for a neutral venue in Riga, Latvia today.
The game tipped off at 4pm this afternoon and Israel won the fixture 87-57.
Photos were published online this week of the Israeli teamposing with armed members of the Israeli Defence Forcesat a sports hall in Tel Aviv.
Ireland’s decision to fulfil today’s fixture came under increased public scrutiny this week, forcing Basketball Ireland CEO John Feehan torepeatedly defend the decisionnot to withdraw.
Yesterday, Israeli basketball player Dor Sa’ar described the Ireland teamas “antisemitic”.
In an interviewpublished on the Israeli Basketball Federation website, Sa’ar said: “It’s known that they are quite antisemitic and it’s no secret, and maybe that’s why a strong game is expected. We have to show that we’re better than them and win.”

Speaking after today’s game, head coach James Weldon said the team didn’t engage in the pre-match activities “as a direct result of those unwarranted and unacceptable comments from the Israeli camp about our players”.

“It was hugely disappointing. We came here for a game of basketball, we wanted to win, but didn’t come out on the right side of the result on this occasion. We had three international debutants in this game, we’re building a squad, so there’s positives to take from this game,” he said.
Weldon also praised his players for showing “incredible maturity in how they handled a very pressured week”.
“It’s been difficult for all of us, but we kept it tight and kept it together and all I can say is that we did not back down out there today. They’re a good side, a player who played in the WNBA, all professional players. The second half was really good and we’ve got plenty to build on.”
Before the game this afternoon, Basketball Ireland confirmed that the team would no longer partake in the traditional pre-match arrangements.

Basketball Ireland said it informed FIBA yesterday that “as a direct result of recent comments made by Israeli players and coaching staff – including inflammatory and wholly inaccurate accusations of antisemitism, published on official Israeli federation channels – that our players will not be partaking in traditional pre-match arrangements with our upcoming opponents”.
“This includes exchanging of gifts, formal handshakes before or after the game, while our players will line up for the national anthem by our bench, rather than centre court,” it said.
Basketball Ireland said it “fully supports” its players in their decision.

Varadkar says Ireland shouldn't 'disadvantage ourselves' by boycotting basketball game with Israel,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said Ireland shouldn’t “disadvantage ourselves” by boycotting the game against Israel in today’s FIBA Women’s EuroBasket 2025 Qualifier.

Ireland’s decision to fulfil today’s fixture has come under increased public scrutiny this week, forcing Basketball Ireland CEO John Feehan torepeatedly defend the decisionnot to withdraw.
Speaking toNewstalk’s Pat Kennythis morning, the Taoiseach said it is the team’s decision whether they play the game.
He said he has a “very clear view” on the general issue of boycotts, be it sports, music and so on.
“I don’t think we should disadvantage ourselves,” Varadkar said.
“It’s one thing to expel Russia or expel Israel from certain sporting events or certain music events or contests, and I think that may well be appropriate, but for us to remove ourselves actually isn’t a good idea, in my view, because all we do is disadvantage ourselves,” he said.
In a statement posted on social media last night, sports star Kieran Donaghy said Basketball Ireland needs to “have a rethink and be strong”.

He said the organisation should withdraw the Irish women’s team from today’s game, adding that “it’s never too late to do the right thing”.
Donaghy said it is a “shame” the players and coaching staff have been put in this position.
“They have worked so hard to play at this level and represent their country and they do so with immense pride. This decision should not sit solely on their shoulders,” he said.
RTÉ Newsreported yesterday that five Irish players are believed to have chosen not to travel to Latvia for the game.
Donaghy, in his statement, criticised the FIBA governing bodies for “letting a country committing genocide” compete, adding that it is a “scandal in itself”.
The Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport said in a statement today that “we must acknowledge” Basketball Ireland’s “independence and autonomy” in deciding to honour its fixture commitment today.
“It should also be acknowledged that this situation places individual players in a very difficult position,” a spokesperson for the Department said.
Yesterday, Israeli basketball player Dor Sa’ar described the Ireland teamas “antisemitic”.

Basketball Ireland responded yesterday evening in astatement issued to the Irish Independent.
The organisation said it is “extremely disappointed by these accusations, which are both inflammatory and wholly inaccurate”.

“Basketball Ireland would refute these allegations towards our players in the strongest possible terms and we have raised this matter with FIBA Europe.”
Varadkar told Pat Kenny this morning that he disagrees “profoundly” with the accusation the Irish team are antisemitic.
“People who disagree with the policies and actions of the Israeli government aren’t antisemitic, per se,” Varadkar said.
Minister of State for Sport Thomas Byrne also said today, in an interview with RTÉ, he “absolutely rejects” any allegation of antisemitism in Ireland.
Basketball Ireland CEO John Feehan said Ireland is obliged to play this fixture as the ramifications of not doing so “would be ruinous to the women’s international programme”.
He said that boycotting the games with Israel would “lead to huge fines from FIBA of up to €180,000, along with an effective five-year ban for the team”.
Former Ireland international Rebecca O’Keeffe told RTÉ News, however, that “it’s not until the second return game in November that they could incur a second fine and a potential ban”.
“It’s worth noting that there is a separation of sanctions there and it’s worth noting that a lot can happen in the meantime,” O’Keeffe said.
At least 27,840 people have been killed by Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks of 7 October, according to the health ministry in the Gaza Strip.

US drone strike kills three members of the Kataib Hezbollah militia in Iraq,"A US DRONE strike has hit a car in the Iraqi capital, killing three members of the powerful Kataib Hezbollah militia including a high-ranking commander.
The strike occurred on a main road in the Mashtal neighbourhood in eastern Baghdad.
A crowd gathered as emergency response teams picked through the wreckage.
Security forces closed off the heavily guarded Green Zone, where a number of diplomatic compounds are located, amid calls for protesters to storm the US embassy.
A US official said that a senior Kataib Hezbollah commander was targeted in today’s strike in Iraq.
Two officials with Iran-backed militias in Iraq said that one of the three killed was Wissam Mohammed “Abu Bakr” al-Saadi, the commander in charge of Kataib Hezbollah’s operations in Syria.

The strike came amid tensions in the region and days after the US military launched an air assault on dozens of sites in Iraq and Syria used by Iranian-backed militias and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in retaliation for a drone strike that killed three US troops in Jordan in late January.
The US has blamed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a broad coalition of Iran-backed militias, for the attack in Jordan, and officials have said they suspect Kataib Hezbollah of leading it.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has regularly claimed strikes on bases housing US troops in Iraq and Syria against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, saying that they are in retaliation for Washington’s support of Israel.
Kataib Hezbollah said in a statement that it was suspending attacks on American troops to avoid “embarrassing the Iraqi government” after the strike in Jordan, but others have vowed to continue fighting.
Three militants died in the strike
The latest surge in the regional conflict came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected terms proposed by Hamas for a hostage-release agreement that would lead to a permanent ceasefire, vowing to continue the war until “absolute victory”.
Also today, the media office of the Houthi rebels in Yemen reported two air strikes in the Ras Issa area in Salif district in Hodeida province.","10.31pm, 7 Feb 2024",,
Israeli PM Netanyahu rejects Hamas ceasefire demands and vows to secure ‘absolute victory’,"ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected Hamas’s terms for a ceasefire and hostage-release agreement, calling them “delusional”.
Netanyahu also vowed to press ahead with Israel’s war against Hamas, now in its fifth month, until achieving “absolute victory”.
He made the comments shortly after meeting US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who has been travelling around the region in the hope of securing a ceasefire agreement.
“Surrendering to Hamas’s delusional demands that we heard now not only won’t lead to freeing the captives, it will just invite another massacre,” Netanyahu said in a nationally televised evening news conference.
“We are on the way to an absolute victory,” he said, adding that the operation would last months, not years. “There is no other solution.”

An agreement was proposed by mediators last month that would implement a temporary pause in fighting to allow aid enter Gaza and an exchange of hostages and prisoners.
However, neither Israel nor Hamas has yet signed up to it.
Blinken met with Israeli leaders as part of a trip covering multiple Middle Eastern countries.
Qatar, whose officials have worked on mediating deals, said Hamas has given “some comments” on the proposal but was generally “positive” about it.
Hamas’s reply has been shared with Israel and Blinken intends to discuss it with Israeli leaders today.

Earlier, Blinken said there is “a lot of work to be done” but that he believes an agreement “is possible and indeed essential”.

Blinken ruled out any arrangement that leaves Hamas in full or partial control of Gaza.
He also said that Israel is the “only power” capable of guaranteeing security in the long term.
A Hamas source said last week that the proposed truce looks for a six-week pause in the conflict, during which time Israeli hostages in Gaza would be swapped for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel and more aid would be allowed to enter Gaza.
However, on Monday, Netanyahu said Hamas had presented “demands that we will not accept” for an exchange involving thousands of prisoners.

At the same time, Israel’s bombardment of Gaza continues to take more lives, with another hundred people killed overnight, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
Israel’s offensive has killed at least 27,707 people in Gaza since October and displaced more than half of the population of 2.4 million people, as well as destroying hospitals and severely impacting supplies of food and water.
Israel appears set to push into Rafah, the southern town by the border crossing with Egypt where thousands and thousands of refugees have fled from further north.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said earlier this week that the army “will reach places where we have not yet fought… right up to the last Hamas bastion, which is Rafah”.
A spokesperson for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, Jens Laerke, said that “intensified hostilities in Rafah in this situation could lead to large-scale loss of civilian lives, and we must do everything possible within our power to avoid that”.

However, he added: “The reality is, is it going to make a blind bit of difference if we make a grand gesture and the simple answer to that is, in our view, no.”

Basketball Ireland CEO says boycotting game against Israel wouldn't make 'blind bit of difference',"LAST UPDATE|7 Feb
BASKETBALL IRELAND CEO John Feehan has said that a boycott of Ireland’s game against Israel in tomorrow’s FIBA Women’s EuroBasket 2025 Qualifier wouldn’t “make a blind bit of difference”.
The game was originally due to take place in Israel on 9 November 2023, but waspostponed due to the conflict in the regionand later rescheduled for a neutral venue in Riga, Latvia on 8 February.
Photos were published online this week of the Israeli teamposing with armed members of the Israeli Defence Forcesat a sports hall in Tel Aviv.
Calls have been made for Basketball Irelandto boycott the fixture.
However, speaking to RTÉ News last night, Feehan said he is not willing to do so.
“We have huge sympathy for what’s happening in Gaza. All the players, whether they’re in Latvia or not, feel the same way,” he said.

However, he added: “The reality is, is it going to make a blind bit of difference if we make a grand gesture and the simple answer to that is, in our view, no.”
Feehan said he is “not prepared to destroy my sport for a gesture that will have no impact”.

Speaking on Monday, Feehan said that Basketball Ireland is obliged to play this fixture as the remifications of not doing so “would be ruinous to the women’s international programme”.
He said that boycotting the games with Israel would “lead to huge fines from FIBA of up to €180,000, along with an effective five-year ban for the team”.
Former Ireland international Rebecca O’Keeffe told RTÉ News, however, that “it’s not until the second return game in November that they could incur a second fine and a potential ban”.
“It’s worth noting that there is a separation of sanctions there and it’s worth noting that a lot can happen in the meantime,” O’Keeffe said.
RTÉ News has reported that five Irish players are believed to have chosen not to travel to Latvia for the game.

“By not taking a firm stance, it’s up to the players to take a stand,” O’Keeffe said.
“We have to say a massive respect to the players  who have taken a stand, but also at the same time no judgement to the others players who are going because it shouldn’t have been in their hands in the first place. The governing bodies, FIBA especially, should’ve taken it out of their hands,” she said.

In a statement on X, formerly Twitter, last night, the Irish Sport for Palestine group rejected Feehan’s claims that boycotting the Ireland-Israel game would be “ruinous” for Basketball Ireland.
“We say not in our name. Playing with Israel will forever be ‘ruinous’ for his and Basketball Ireland’s reputation,” the group said.
At least 27,585 people have been killed by Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas attacks of 7 October, according to the health ministry in the Gaza Strip.

Qatar says Hamas response to new Gaza truce proposal is 'positive',"LAST UPDATE|6 Feb
THE PRIME MINISTER of Qatar has said that Hamas’s response to a proposed new truce to free hostages in return for pausing the conflict in Gaza is “positive”.
It comes as the Palestinian health ministry said heavy strikes and fighting in Gaza killed at least 107 people in the last 24 hours.
The truce deal, which US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will take to Israel, proposes a six-week pause to fighting as Hamas frees hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and more aid enters Gaza, according to a Hamas source.
“We have received a reply from Hamas with regards to the general framework of the agreement with regards to hostages. The reply includes some comments, but in general it is positive,” Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said after meeting Blinken in Doha.
The proposed truce deal was hashed out in Paris during talks with Israel, Egypt and the CIA. The Qatari prime minister, who took part in the talks, said he was “optimistic” but declined to discuss the Hamas reply in detail, citing the “sensitivity of the circumstances”.
Hamas confirmed that it submitted its response to Egypt and Qatar.
Blinken, on his fifth regional tour since the current conflict began, said that he would discuss the proposal tomorrow in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced pressure from hardliners against perceived concessions to Hamas.
“There’s still a lot of work to be done. But we continue to believe that an agreement is possible and indeed essential, and we will continue to work relentlessly to achieve it,” Blinken said.

The US envoy earlier met Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo, a day after he held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh.
Blinken and Sisi “discussed ongoing efforts to secure the release of all hostages held by Hamas,” said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.
He also “expressed appreciation for Egypt’s leadership role in facilitating the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza”, Miller said.
Israeli troops, with air and naval support, have been engaged in heavy combat centred on Gaza’s main southern city of Khan Younis, the hometown of Hamas’s Gaza chief, Yahya Sinwar, much of which has been reduced to rubble.
Israel accuses Sinwar of masterminding the 7 October attack, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also seized around 250 hostages. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza, including 28 who are believed to have been killed.
Israel’s military campaign has killed at least 27,585 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.

The army said today that “over the past day, dozens of terrorists have been killed and approximately 80 individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity have been apprehended, including a number of terrorists that took part in the October 7 massacre”.
“No place is safe, no place at all – where shall we go?” one Palestinian, Mohamad Kozaat, said after six members of his family were wounded in an Israeli strike on Rafah.
Around 8,000 displaced people were evacuated from the besieged Al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis, where they had sought refuge, after weeks of heavy shelling and fighting nearby.
A spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said the organisation was told that the Al-Amal hospital, run by the Palestinian Red Crescent (PRCS), had been largely emptied following a lengthy siege by Israeli forces.
“The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is beyond catastrophic,” Tommaso Della Longa told reporters in Geneva.
“Eight thousand internally displaced people who sought refuge in our Palestinian Red Crescent hospital in Khan Yunis … left the hospital yesterday.”
Della Longa said the hospital was hit several times, including on Friday, when a PRCS volunteer was killed. Around 100 elderly, wounded and disabled patients remain there, with about 100 staff and volunteers, the ICRC said.
Della Longa said that Al-Amal had faced immense challenges, such as dire shortages of medicines, food and water, even before it was evacuated.

The United Nations humanitarian monitors said that Israel’s evacuation orders in Gaza now cover two-thirds of the region’s land.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced in Gaza since October because of the fighting and Israel’s expanding evacuation orders.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has said in its latest daily report on the humanitarian situation in Gaza that intense Israeli bombardment by land, sea and air is being reported across much of the Strip, resulting in civilian casualties, displacement, and destruction of civilian infrastructure.
More than half of Gaza’s population, which stood at 2.3 million people before the war, is now packed into the town of Rafah near the border crossing with Egypt and surrounding areas, according to the OCHA.
Unicef has reported that most newly displaced people have only 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day for drinking, cooking and washing.
Israel initially focused its attacks on Gaza in northern areas, telling civilians to evacuate towards the south, but has turned to bombing southern cities like Khan Younis and Rafah, killing refugees who had fled from the north.
The areas affected by evacuation orders was home to 1.78 million Palestinians, or 67% of Gaza’s population.
Yesterday, Israeli gunfire hit a food convoy waiting to enter northern Gaza, according to aUN official.

Blinken arrives in Saudi Arabia for another Middle East tour a bid to secure Israel-Hamas truce,"LAST UPDATE|5 Feb
US SECRETARY OF State Antony Blinken has landed in Saudi Arabia to kick off his latest regional crisis trip aimed at securing a new truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict.
The top US diplomat’s plane touched down in Riyadh, according to an AFP journalist travelling with him.
This is Blinken’s his fifth trip to the region since Hamas’s 7 October attack that triggered the fighting. He is also due to visit Israel, Egypt and Qatar.
Ahead of the trip, Blinken stressed the need for “urgently addressing humanitarian needs in Gaza”, after aid groups have repeatedly sounded the alarm over the devastating impact nearly four months of war have had on the besieged Gaza Strip.
“The situation is indescribable,” said Said Hamouda, a Palestinian who fled his home to the southern Gaza city of Rafah on the border with Egypt.
With Blinken arriving in the region, he is expected to discuss a proposed truce thrashed out in a Paris meeting in January of top US, Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials.
The diplomatic push has become more urgent with the surge in attacks across the region by Iran-backed groups in solidarity with Hamas,triggering counterattacks by the United States.
The proposed truce would pause fighting for an initial six weeks as Hamas frees hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, according to a Hamas source.
Hamas has said no agreement has yet been reached, while some Israeli officials have expressed opposition to any perceived concessions.
At least 27,365 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s offensive, according to the territory’s health ministry.

Blinken’s trip comes as Israel has in recent days pressed further south towards the southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt, warning that its ground forces could advance on Rafah as part of the campaign to eradicate Hamas.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said “a complete victory will deal a fatal blow” to Hamas but also to other Iran-backed militant groups across the region.
Rafah now hosts more than half of Gaza’s population, displaced due to Israel’s assault.
This morning, sources told AFP they could hear artillery shelling in the areas of eastern Rafah and Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s main city.
Israel says Khan Younis is where militants prepared for the 7 October attack, and that high-ranking Hamas officials are hiding there.
At least 128 people, mostly women and children, were killed in Israeli strikes overnight in the besieged territory, according to the Gaza health ministry.
Gazans have faced dire humanitarian conditions, and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on X that “there is very limited access to clean water and sanitation amid relentless bombardment”.

UNRWA itselfis facing a major controversyafter accusations that 12 staff members were involved in Hamas’s October 7 attack.
More than a dozen countries, led by the United States, suspended their funding to the agency after the claims surfaced.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has saidIreland is not planning to suspend fundingto the Agency following the allegations.
Spain has said it would give an additional €3.5 million “so that UNRWA can maintain its activities in the short term”, said Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares.

UN chief Antonio Guterres announced the creation of an independent panel to assess UNRWA and “whether the agency is doing everything within its power to ensure neutrality”, a UN statement said.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II urged donors to maintain support for the agency “to allow it to provide its vital humanitarian services… particularly in light of the tragic humanitarian situation in Gaza”, a royal statement said.
In a meeting with Emirati President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Amman, the two leaders urged the protection of civilians in Gaza and called to intensify efforts towards a lasting ceasefire and a “political solution” to the conflict, the statement said.
French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne, on his first visit to the region since taking office, said peace will only be achieved through diplomacy, urging the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks “without delay”.
Before departing for the region, Blinken said that the humanitarian crisis would be one of his focuses.
“Urgently addressing humanitarian needs in Gaza and advancing stability in the Middle East are priorities we share with Saudi Arabia,” Blinken said he told Saudi foreign minister Faisal bin Farhan.
Blinken’s latest Middle East visit comes as Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir told the Wall Street Journal that its key ally has not shown sufficient support.
“Instead of giving us his full backing, (US President Joe) Biden is busy with giving humanitarian aid and fuel (to Gaza), which goes to Hamas,” he said in an article published yesterday.
His outburst came after Washington imposed sanctions on four settlers amid rising violence against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, saying: “I don’t need help to know how to navigate our relations with the US and the international community, while standing firm on our national interests.”

Hamas considers hostage exchange deal as Israel kills 127 more people in strikes on Gaza,"ISRAELI STRIKES ACROSS Gaza killed dozens of people overnight, with battles raging today as Hamas reviews a new proposal for a pause in fighting in exchange for releasing hostages.
Gaza’s health ministry said at least 127 people were killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, including 90 overnight.
The Hamas government’s media office said a preschool where families were sheltering was hit in the southern border city of Rafah, where many refugees have fled from more northern parts of Gaza.
The nearby southern city of Khan Younis is also being targeted by Israel in air and naval strikes.
The Israeli army said today that its troops raided “a compound used by the commander of Hamas’s Khan Younis brigade”, seizing weapons and killing Hamas militants.
Wednesday will mark the fifth month of fighting since Hamas’ attack on Israel on 7 October. Since then, the death toll from Israel’s assault on Gaza has reached 27,365, according to the health ministry.
The AFP news agency is reporting that experts and rights groups have said Israeli forces have destroyed buildings near the border in a bit to create a ‘buffer zone’ inside Gaza, though Israel has not confirmed the plan publicly.
Nadia Hardman, an expert on refugees at Human Rights Watch, said the actions “may amount to a war crime” and that “we are seeing mounting evidence that Israel appears to be rendering large parts of Gaza unlivable”.

President Michael D. Higgins issues a statement yesterday warning that if Israel continues to strike areas densely population with refugees, it will“leave any respect for humanitarian law in tatters”.
The president said that “what is at stake now, given the high proportion of loss of life of non-combatants, and particularly of women and children, is the potential emptying out of the entire space and discourse of human rights and international humanitarian law”.
Hostage exchange talks
International mediators are trying to get both sides to sign up to a deal that was put together in a meeting in Paris with officials from US, Israel, Egypt and Qatar.
It is understood that the proposal involves an initial six-week pause to allow more aid to be delivered into Gaza and a phased release of Israeli hostages in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Hamas is still considering the deal.
There is mounting criticism among Israelis of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and protests against the government over its failure to strike a deal to get hostages out of Gaza.
One protester in Tel Aviv yesterday evening called Michal Hadas said she feared Israel’s leaders are dragging out the conflict for political reasons “because as long as the war continues, there will be no election”.

President Higgins warns of 'moment of global crisis' as Israel strikes refugee-dense southern Gaza,"PRESIDENT MICHAEL D. Higgins has decried Israel’s strikes in southern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled from further north, calling the prospect of more violence a ‘moment of global crisis’.
The president received an update last night in a phone call from Dr Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation, who detailed the dire situation in Gaza as the recorded death toll since October passes 27,000.
Israel initially focused its attacks on Gaza in northern areas, telling civilians to evacuate towards the south, but has turned to bombing southern cities like Khan Younis and Rafah, killing refugees who had fled from the north.
President Higgins has said that any further strikes on areas densely populated with refugees would “leave any respect for humanitarian law in tatters”.
In total, 75% of Gaza’s population has been displaced. The health system has collapsed and more than half a million people are facing hunger and starvation, according to the WHO.
70% of people who have been killed in Gaza to date are women and children, with a further 17,000 children now without their parents.
“Given all of these facts, any further extension of the bombing campaign into what is a densely populated area to which so many people have fled would leave any respect for humanitarian law in tatters,” President Higgins said.
“The suggestion that such a development take place and be watched in near silence is a suggestion that removes all morality from any stated position of public concern for the most basic of human rights.”
The president said that “what is at stake now, given the high proportion of loss of life of non-combatants, and particularly of women and children, is the potential emptying out of the entire space and discourse of human rights and international humanitarian law”.

He said that beyond a ceasefire, which he described as being immediately necessary, and the release of hostages and provision of humanitarian supports, there must serious discussions about a meaningful long-term resolution that can “provide peace and security to both the people of Palestine and the people of Israel” – adding that this must include the recognition of a Palestinian State.
Gaza’s health ministry said more than 100 people were killed in strikes overnight, with 105 killed the night before.
Rafah, which has a border crossing with Egypt, formerly had a population of 200,000 but is now holding more than half of Gaza’s total population of over two million, according to the WHO.
President Higgins called for countries that have suspended funding to the UNRWA, the United Nations’s agency for Palestinian refugees, to resume it urgently.
12 of the agency’s staff members have been accused by Israel of aiding Hamas in its attacks on 7 October, prompting the UN to open an investigation.
Several countries, including the US and UK, consequently suspended their funding to the agency – which was already pushed to the brink due to the tremendous need for its services in Gaza.
President Higgins said it is “vital” that countries continue to support the UNRWA, which has 13,000 staff members in Gaza who are “assisting some of the most broken people on the planet in the most devastating of circumstances”.
“The small number of those suspected of being connected to the appalling atrocities carried out by Hamas on 7 October have correctly been dealt with,” the president said, adding that other countries should now follow Ireland’s example and restore their funding for the UNRWA.
“Those countries who have removed their funding from UNRWA must be reminded of the unavoidable consequences their actions are likely to have on this most vulnerable. This is not a matter on which anyone who believes in the vital need for a humanitarian response can remain silent.”
152 UNRWA staff have died in Gaza.

Israel hits southern city of Rafah crowded with hundreds of thousands of refugees,"ISRAEL HIT THE crowded border town of Rafah in the early hours of this morning, where hundreds of thousands of people have fled to while escaping conflict further north.
Rafah, which has a border crossing with Egypt, formerly had a population of 200,000 but is now holding more than half of Gaza’s total population of over two million, according to the World Health Organisation.
Gaza’s health ministry said more than 100 people were killed overnight and an AFP journalist reported hearing powerful explosions shortly after midnight.
The United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) expressed concern over the bombardment of the southern city of Khan Yunis, which has pushed more and more people further south in recent days.
“Most are living in makeshift structures, tents or out in the open,” OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke said. “Rafah is a pressure cooker of despair, and we fear for what comes next.”
Around 30% of Gaza’s structures have been affected by the war, according to satellite data collected in January and released yesterday.
The region faced winter storms and heavy rain yesterday, with some people wearing hazmat suits left over from the Covid-19 pandemic to try to protect themselves from the weather.
Abdulkarim Misbah, a 32-year-old father seeking refuge in Rafah with his family, first left his home in the northern Jabalia refugee camp to go to the southern city of Khan Yunis, but had to flee again due to the attacks on the city.
“We escaped last week from death in Khan Yunis, without bringing anything with us. We didn’t find a place to stay. We slept on the streets the first two nights. The women and children slept in a mosque,” he said.

The family later received a donated tent and set it up beside the Egyptian border.
“My four children are shivering from the cold. They feel sick and unwell all the time,” he said.
Israel has killed at least 27,131 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, since October.
Around 17,000 children in Gaza are now unaccompanied or separated from their parents due to the war, according to the UN children’s agency UNICEF.
“Each one has a heartbreaking story of loss and grief,” spokesperson Jonathan Crickx said.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to travel to the Middle East again in the coming days to push for a new deal of an exchange of Israeli hostages for a pause in the conflict.
Qatar said this week that there were hopes of “good news” about a fresh pause to the fighting “in the next couple of weeks” and that discussions had arrived at an agreement for exchanging hostages and prisoners.
However, a Hamas source told news agency AFP that there was “no agreement on the framework of the agreement yet” and that “the Qatari statement is rushed and not true”.
Hamas’s position was that an initial six-week halt to the fighting and more aid deliveries into Gaza would then allow for “women, children and sick men over 60″ to be freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel. There would also be “negotiations around the withdrawal of Israeli forces”.

Domestic calls for a ceasefire and hostage deal have risen in Israel, with protesters gathering in Tel Aviv last night carrying placards showing hostages’ faces and slogans like “No more bloodshed”.
In the US, President Joe Biden imposed sanctions yesterday on four Israeli settlers over violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.
Any assets the sanctioned individuals hold in the US will be blocked and Americans will be forbidden from engaging in financial transactions with them.
“The situation in the West Bank — in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction — has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security and stability,” Biden said in an executive order.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: “Israel must do more to stop violence against civilians in the West Bank and hold accountable those responsible for it.”

Government defeats Sinn Féin motion calling on intervention in genocide case against Israel,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS defeated a motion brought by Sinn Féin seeking for Ireland to intervene in South Africa’s against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
The final tally was 71-62 in the Government’s favour, after it had added several amendments to the Opposition motion.
Out of four amendments, the key changes sought by the Government altered the wording calling for Ireland to signal its intention to join the case.
It also amended the wording of the motion so that the Government would “commence the process of preparing for potential participation in the case”.
Sinn Féin had called on the Government to “file a declaration of intention to intervene” in the case taken by South Africa to the ICJ. It also called for the Government to “commence the process of preparing for participation in the case”.
It was thesecond consecutive evening the motion was before the Dáil chamber, after voting was deferred into tonight’s sitting.

Last night, Sinn Féin TDs had criticised the Government for its failure to commit Ireland to intervening in South Africa’s case of genocide against Israel for its actions in Gaza.
The Sinn Féin motion follows the defeat of a similar motion last week put forward by the Social Democrats.
At least 26,000 people – mostly civilians – have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since it launched a war in relation to attacks by the militant group Hamas on 7 October that left about 1,140 people dead.
The vote came after the ICJ filed provisional orders last Friday about the conflict in Gaza, which Israel must comply with. It said Israel must do everything it can to “prevent the commission of all acts within the scope” of the Genocide Convention.
Israel has also been asked by the court to take “all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide”.
It must also take “immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians”.
It is expected the next stage of the case will take a number of months, as South Africa drafts a document that outlines its substantive case against Israel, during which time the Government will decide on whether to intervene in the case.

"Hamas reviewing six-week truce proposal, as UN says half of Gaza's buildings have been damaged","
HAMAS IS REVIEWING a proposal for a six-week truce with Israel, a source told AFP today, as fighting rages in southern Gaza and the UN seeks to restore aid funding.
Earlier this week, Hamas said it was mulling proposals drawn up by mediators in Paris for a second truce nearly four months since the fighting began.
While a November pause to the fighting lasted a week, the latest accord aims to pave the way for an initial six-week halt to the fighting.
Over that period, Israel would release between 200 and 300 Palestinian prisoners who are not deemed high-security detainees, in exchange for 35 to 40 hostages held in Gaza, a Hamas source close to Egyptian and Qatari mediators said.
Only “women, children and sick men over 60″ who are captive in Gaza would be freed at this stage, the Hamas source told AFP, declining to be named given the sensitivity of the issue.
Palestinian militants seized about 250 hostages during Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel.
The attack resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, mostly civilians.
Israel says 132 of the hostages remain in Gaza, including at least 29 people believed to have been killed.
Relentless bombardment by Israel and a ground invasion has killed at least 26,900 people in Gaza since then, most of them women and children, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
The UN today said that around half of all buildings in Gaza have been damaged and that the Palestinian territory has been left uninhabitable.
The UN said that tens of billions of dollars will be needed to rebuild it, and added that the decline in living conditions had been “precipitous”.
The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimated that by late November, 37,379 buildings – the equivalent of 18% of the Gaza Strip’s total structures – had been damaged or destroyed in Israel’s military offensive.
And since then, satellite data indicates increased levels of destruction.

“The new data says that 50% of the structures in Gaza are (damaged or) destroyed,” said Rami Alazzeh, an UNCTAD economist focused on assistance to the Palestinian people.
He warned that “the longer these (military) operations in Gaza go on… the more severe the impact will be”.
“Gaza currently is uninhabitable.”
Even if reconstruction in Gaza were to start immediately, the UNCTAD said “there is no doubt that it will amount to several tens of billions of dollars by any conservative estimation”.
The UN agency stressed that any resolution of the crisis would require an end to the military operation and lifting of the blockade and movement towards a two-state solution.
The goal, it said, cannot be to simply “return to the pre-October 2023 status quo”.
“The vicious circle of destruction and partial reconstruction needs to be broken.”
Meanwhile,the BBC has also seen analysis which also reveals that half of Gaza’s buildings have been damaged.
Detailed before-and-after satellite imagery also shows how the bombardment of southern and central Gaza has intensified since the start of December.
The analysis suggested between 144,000 and 175,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip have been damaged, equating to between 50% and 61% of Gaza’s buildings.
Elsewhere, Alazzeh pointed out that the decline in GDP per capita seen in Gaza last year was equivalent to that suffered during the entire blockade period and through six prior military operations.
And while 45% of Gaza’s workforce were unemployed before 7 October, the jobless rate had surged to nearly 80% by December.
“All of the economic sector in Gaza has ground to a halt,” Alazzeh said, adding that  virtually the only people working are those involved in humanitarian operations.

UN Secretary General asks countries to restore funding to agency for Palestinian refugees,"THE HEAD OF the United Nations has implored countries to restore funding to the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees after several nations cut off donations over accusations against the agency’s employees.
The US, UK, Germany and Japan, among others, have called off funding to the UNRWA after several employees were accused of involvement in Hamas’ 7 October attacks on Israel.
The refugee agency is the only lifeline for thousands of people suffering in Gaza.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres held talks with 35 donor countries, appealing for funds to be restored.
He briefed the ambassadors on actions he has taken since the accusations emerged from Israel, calling them “horrific”. An investigation has been launched.
After the meeting, Palestinian UN ambassador Riyad Mansour told reporters that Guterres asked countries that suspended funding to reconsider and called on other countries, “including those in the region, to step up to the plate.”

Mansour said 153 UNRWA staff have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, which is the largest number of UN personnel killed in an operation since World War Two.
He urged donors not to take actions “that constitute a collective punishment against millions of Palestinian refugees.”
Key UN bodies, including the World Health Organisation, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), have signed a joint statement warning of the “catastrophic consequences” that cutting of funding will bring for the people of Gaza.
“No other entity has the capacity to deliver the scale and breadth of assistance that 2.2 million people in Gaza urgently need. We appeal for these decisions to be reconsidered,” the bodies said.
“Withdrawing funds from UNRWA is perilous and would result in the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza, with far-reaching humanitarian and human rights consequences in the occupied Palestinian territory and across the region.
The statement said that the allegations are “horrifying” and “any UN employee involved in acts of terror will be held accountable”.
“However, we must not prevent an entire organization from delivering on its mandate to serve people in desperate need.”

Strong words as Government and opposition debate intervening in genocide case against Israel,"OPPOSITION TDS STRONGLY criticised the Government in the Dáil this evening for its failure to commit Ireland to intervening in South Africa’s case of genocide against Israel for its actions in Gaza.
TD weredebating a Sinn Féin motionthat had called on the Government to “file a declaration of intention to intervene” in the case taken by South Africa to the ICJ. It also called for the Government to “commence the process of preparing for participation in the case”.
The Government added a number of amendments this evening to the motion put down by Sinn Féin. Voting will take place on these amendments tomorrow.
The Government added four amendments in total. The key amendments changed the wording calling for Ireland to signal its intention to join the case to “urgently consider filing a declaration of intervention in this case with the ICJ, based on a legal analysis of the Genocide Convention, the Court’s provisional measures order and consultation with other Contracting Parties”.
It also amended the wording of the motion so that the Government would “commence the process of preparing for potential participation in the case”.
The amendments were rejected by Sinn Féin, who called on TDs to vote against them tomorrow. The Sinn Féin motionfollows the defeat of a similar motionlast week put forward by the Social Democrats.
Sinn Féin spokesperson on Foreign Affairs & Defence Matt Carthy criticised the Government for not supporting his party’s motion and called for TDs to “take action”.
“Our appeal to all the members of this House, is to take this action, this action which simply involves us following the very brave leadership of South Africa by making and joining the case against Israel.
At least 26,000 people – mostly civilians – have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since it launched a war in relation to attacks by the militant group Hamas on 7 October that left about 1,140 people dead.
The vote came after the ICJfiled provisional orders last Fridayabout the conflict in Gaza, which Israel must comply with. It said Israel must do everything it can to “prevent the commission of all acts within the scope” of the Genocide Convention.
Israel has also been asked by the court to take “all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide”.
It must also take “immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians”.
It is expected the next stage of the casewill take a number of months, as South Africa drafts a document that outlines its substantive case against Israel, during which time the Government will decide on whether to intervene in the case.

The Sinn Féin motion also noted the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and called on Israel to implement the orders from the ICJ. The Government broadly upheld the text of these calls, with an amendment adding in a condemnation of the Hamas attacks.
Strong words
Strong words were issued in the Dáil today as the motion was being debated, with key figures from all parties and Independent TDs making statements. All contributors called for the Government to press for a ceasefire and expressed outrage at Israel’s actions.
However, opposition speakers were highly critical of what they called the Government’s stand-off approach. Sinn Féin’s John Brady criticised the Government for saying that it will wait to decide whether to intervene in the case.
“Tánaiste, the Palestinian people haven’t got four months or six months, they haven’t got a week. They are dying in their 1000s The government is morally bound to support Sinn Fein’s motion here this evening,” he said.
In response to Brady, Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Micheál Martin defended the Government’s record that said that “all of us in this house are united in our view that what is happening in Gaza must stop”.
“I’ve been clear from the start of this horrible conflict that Ireland needs to use all the tools we have at our disposal. Political, legal, diplomatic, and humanitarian,” he said.
Martin laid out the measures the Government had taken in relation to the conflict, and went into the detail on the specifics of the South African case and explained the Government’s rationale for waiting to intervene. Martin also explained the reasons for the Government’s counter-motions.
“However remote the possibility may seem, the only possible solution can be through political means through a process which respects the right to self determination for the Palestinian people, and which delivers peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis alike,” he said.
Martin’s comments were met with strong criticism from Opposition parties, however, with the Labour Party, the Social Democrats, Solidarity-People Before Profit, and a number of Independents all calling for the Government to intervene in the case.
Many speakers also highlighted the recent suspension of funding by the US and others for UNRWA – the United Nations Relief and Works Agency – following allegations that a number of its workers were involved on the 7 October attacks.
The move was met with strong criticism across the Dáil this evening, with TDs highlighting the essential nature of the work carried out by the agency in Gaza. Martin reiterated his statement that Ireland would not withdraw funding for the agency.
A vote on the Government’s amendments will be held tomorrow.

ICJ Gaza genocide case: Ireland expects to decide on intervention within next six months,"IRISH OFFICIALS WILL engage with South Africa over the coming months as the government considers whether to intervene in the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
An intervention is a part of ICJ proceedings in which third-party States participate in order to inform the court of their own legal interests in a case.
Officials from Ireland and South Africa held an initial meeting about the case after the courtfiled provisional orders last Fridayabout the conflict in Gaza, which Israel must comply with.
The court said that Israel must do everything it can to “prevent the commission of all acts within the scope” of the Genocide Convention.
Israel has also been asked by the court to take “all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide”.
It must also take “immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians”.
The court additionally ruled that Israel must try to limit death and damage in Gaza.
The next stage of the case will see South Africa draft a memorial – a document that will outline its substantive case against Israel – to the ICJ over the next few months, during which Ireland will decide on whether to intervene in the case.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuresponded to the ICJ order last weekby saying that his country had a right to defend itself in the wake of the 7 October attacks by Hamas.

He also claimed that the charge of genocide leveled against Israel “is not only false, it’s outrageous”, and that “decent people everywhere should reject it”.
Irish officials will use the next few months to try and gauge whether South Africa has a substantive legal case against Israel under the Genocide Convention and what issues South Africa will focus on during the next stages of the case.
Once South Africa’s legal arguments are at an advanced stage, the government will consider whether those arguments align with Ireland’s interpretation of the Genocide Convention, under which the case against Israel is being brought.
The entire process is expected to take four to six months, after which Irish officials will make a decision on whether the State will intervene based on South Africa’s memorial.
Israel will draft and file its own memorial with the court after it receives South Africa’s memorial, though this is not expected to influence Ireland’s decision.
Ireland previously filed an intervention with the court in September 2022, when it joined 14 other countries in attempting to join Ukraine’s case against Russia under the Genocide Convention.
Last week, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said the Government would “strongly consider” supporting the case and that itwould receive“urgent” legal advice on the matter.
He told reporters yesterday that the case was “complex” and that he had been briefed by officials in his department on the latest developments.
“This is complex. It’s not at all simple. We’re talking about the International Court of Justice, the Genocide Convention, and I will discuss this with all of the opposition parties because I think that they need to be apprised of what actually is involved here,” he said.
His comments came ahead of an expected Sinn Féin motion in the Dáil this evening calling on Ireland to support South Africa’s case.

"Israeli troops, some disguised as medical staff, kill three Palestinians in West Bank hospital","LAST UPDATE|30 Jan
ISRAELI UNDERCOVER AGENTS, some disguised as medical staff, raided a West Bank hospital today and shot dead three Palestinian militants.
The raid occured at Ibn Sina Hospital in the northern city of Jenin.
The Israeli military said forces entered the hospital – a major health facility serving Jenin city and its adjacent refugee camp – to target a “Hamas terrorist cell”.
Announcing the killing by Israeli forces of three people inside the hospital, the Palestinian health ministry stressed healthcare facilities are granted special protection under international law.
“The minister of health calls urgently on the United Nations General Assembly, international institutions and human rights organisations to end the daily string of crimes committed by the occupation (Israel) against our people and health centres,” a ministry statement said.
The Palestinian foreign ministry said the “heinous” hospital killings were a “crime against humanity”, in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.
Closed-circuit television footage tweeted by the Palestinian ministry and said to be from the hospital shows armed men and women, disguised in medical uniforms or civilian clothes, moving through its corridors.
The video shows the Israeli agents using a baby carrier and a wheelchair as props.
Hospital director Naji Nazzal told AFP that “a group of Israeli forces entered the facility undercover and assassinated the men”. They used weapons fitted with silencers, he said.

Inside the hospital, the AFP photographer reported seeing blood soaked into a mat and a chair, and spattered across a wall.
The official Palestinian news agency Wafa has named the three men as Muhammad Jalamnah, Muhammad Ayman Ghazawi and Basel Ayman Ghazawi.
“The operation was carried out at the hospital’s rehabilitation ward where Basel Ghazawi had been undergoing treatment,” the hospital’s director said.
The Ghazawi brothers were claimed as fighters by the Islamic Jihad militant group, while Hamas said Jalamnah was a “commander” in its armed wing.
The Israeli army has charged all three were “terrorists” who were hiding in the hospital.
Jalamnah was involved in “significant terrorist activity” and was known for distributing weapons and ammunition for use in shootings, the army said.
He “planned to carry out a terror attack in the immediate future and used the hospital as a hiding place and therefore was neutralised,” the army said.
Israel’s relentless military offensive has killed at least 26,751 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.
Weapons were placed on the bodies of the Ghazawi brothers as they were carried through the streets of Jenin in a funeral procession.
Israel, which has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, has stepped up its incursions into Palestinian towns ands cities since the 7 October Hamas attack.
Jenin has been the focus of repeated Israeli raids, in which the army has demolished homes and ripped up streets as well as carrying out air strikes.

In the latest efforts to broker a new truce between Israel and Hamas, CIA chief William Burns met top Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials in Paris on Sunday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office called the talks “constructive” but pointed to “significant gaps which the parties will continue to discuss”.
Blinken expressed hope for a deal, telling reporters that “very important, productive work has been done. And there is some real hope going forward”.
Hamas confirmed today that it had received the proposal, saying on its Telegram account that it was “in the process of examining it and delivering its response”.
Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose government helped broker a previous truce in November, voiced hope an initial deal might lead to a permanent ceasefire.
According to him, the current plan included a phased truce that would see women and children hostages released first, with more aid also entering Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose office earlier also called the talks “constructive”, today ruled out releasing “thousands” of Palestinian prisoners as part of any deal to halt fighting in Gaza.
“I would like to make it clear… We will not withdraw the IDF (army) from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousands of terrorists. None of this will happen,” he said in an address at Eli settlement in the occupied West Bank.
Israel’s top ally the US expressed hope for a deal, with Blinken telling reporters that “very important, productive work has been done”.

US Secretary of State urges UN agency to address claims of staff involvement in Hamas attack,"LAST UPDATE|29 Jan
US SECRETARY OF State Antony Blinken has urged the UN agency for Palestinian refugees to address allegations staff members were involved in attacking Israel but distanced himself from calls for the body’s end.
The United States, the main contributor to the agency known as UNRWA, on Friday said it was suspending funding after Israel charged that several staff members took part in the 7 October attack on Israel that has prompted an overwhelming counter-operation.
Blinken called the allegations “deeply, deeply troubling” and said the United States would look very closely to “make sure that this is fully and thoroughly investigated, that there’s clear accountability.”
“At the same time,” he said, “UNRWA has played and continues to play an absolutely indispensable role in trying to make sure that men, women and children who so desperately need assistance in Gaza actually get it.”
“No one else can play the role that UNRWA’s been playing, certainly not in the near term. No one has the reach, the capacity, the structure to do what UNRWA’s been doing,” he said.
“From our perspective, it’s important — more than an important, imperative — that that role continues.
“That only underscores the importance of UNRWA tackling this as quickly as effectively and as thoroughly as possible,” he said.
UNRWA said it has acted promptly over allegations but that cuts in funding will affect ordinary Palestinians.
The UN agency has long been in the crosshairs of Israel, which accuses it of systematically going against Israeli interests.
Meanwhile, the EU today demanded an “urgent” audit of UNRWA and said it is reviewing funding.
The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarinisaid on Fridaythat Israel had provided the agency with information about the alleged involvement of several employees in the attack.
He confirmed the staff in question have been fired and an investigation is taking place.
European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer has told reporters that an audit must be led by European Commission-appointed experts and conducted alongside a UN investigation into the claims.
“What is absolutely clear is that these actions are urgent. They are important and they should be launched without any delay,” Mamer said.
The European Union is one of UNRWA’s top donors.
A commission statement said the EU executive “will determine upcoming funding decisions for UNRWA in light of the very serious allegations made on 24 January relating to the involvement of UNRWA staff in the heinous 7 October attacks”.
It said that no additional funding to UNRWA “is foreseen until the end of February”.
However, it added that humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank “will continue unabated through partner organisations”.

Over the weekend, numerous countries, including the United States, France, Britain, Germany and Japan, suspended further funding to the UN agency.
The European Commission said it “will review the matter in light of the outcome of the investigation announced by the UN and the actions it will take”.
Israel has said it would seek to stop UNRWA from operating in Gaza after the conflict.
Hamas urged the international community to ignore Israel’s “threats”, while the Palestinian Authority said the agency needed “maximum support” from donors.
An Israeli document, which has been shared with US officials and was obtained by The Associated Press, lists 12 people, their alleged roles in the attack, and their job descriptions and photos.
The document said intelligence gathered showed that at least 190 UNRWA workers were Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives, without providing evidence.
It said of the 12 workers, nine were teachers and one was a social worker. Seven of the employees were accused of crossing into Israel on 7 October.
Of those, two were alleged to have kidnapped or assisted in the abduction of Israelis and another two were said to have participated in raids on communal farming villages, according to the document.
One was accused of arming himself with an anti-tank missile the night before the attack, while the document claimed another took photos of a female hostage.
Some were accused of “participating in a terror activity” or coordinating the movement of trucks or weapons used in the attack. Ten were listed as having ties to Hamas and one to the Islamic Jihad militant group.
The names and photos of the accused workers could not immediately be verified.
Two of the 12 have been killed, according to the document. The UN previously said one was still being identified.
In a statement, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said it is “deeply alarmed” by the decision of some countries to suspend their funding to UNRWA.
It said the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached “catastrophic levels” and that any additional limitations on aid “will result in more deaths and suffering”.
“Humanitarian organisations are already grappling to meet even a fraction of the urgent needs in Gaza,” the organisation said.
“Much more aid is required to meet those needs, not less. The consequences these cuts in funding will have on the ground contradict the provisional measures issued by the International Court of Justice on Friday (26 January), which include immediate measures to ensure sufficient humanitarian aid flows into Gaza.”
On Saturday, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said Ireland was not withdrawing its funding.
Speaking today, Martin said in relation to today’s announcement by the EU that he has no issue with the bloc reviewing the situation in light of what happened “once the aid keeps flowing”.
Martin said he will be advocating that all countries, including the US, restore support to UNRWA.
He added that he hopes US aid is restored ahead of Ireland’s visit to the White House on St Patrick’s Day.

Around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Hamas’s 7 October attack in southern Israel, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Militants of Hamas, considered a “terrorist” group by the US and EU, also seized 250 hostages, of whom Israel says around 132 remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead captives.
Israel’s relentless military offensive has since killed at least 26,422 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.
CIA chief William Burns met top Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials in Paris yesterday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the talks were “constructive” but pointed to “significant gaps which the parties will continue to discuss this week”.
US President Joe Biden sent Burns to try to negotiate the release of remaining hostages in exchange for a ceasefire, a security source confirmed to AFP.
The New York Times reported on Saturdaythat the negotiators were discussing a deal under which Israel would suspend the war for about two months in return for the release of over 100 hostages.
Reuters today reportedthat Hamas reiterated its view that releasing hostages it is holding would require a guaranteed end to the Israeli offensive in Gaza and withdrawal of all invasion forces.
“The success of the Paris meeting is dependent on the Occupation (Israel) agreeing to end the comprehensive aggression on Gaza Strip,” senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters.

US vows 'very consequential' response after military members killed in Jordan drone strike,"LAST UPDATE|29 Jan

THE UNITED STATES has vowed a ‘very consequential response’ to a drone attack on a base in Jordan that killed three American troops, with President Joe Bidenblaming Iran-backed militants.
The deaths have raised fears of an escalating conflict, as fighting still rages in Gaza. The attack marks the first US military deaths in an attack in the region since the Israel-Hamas war began.
Speaking to CNN’s Morning Joe, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the response from Washington would be “very consequential”.
“But we don’t seek a war with Iran. We’re not looking for a wider conflict in the Middle East,” he added.
While Washington is still gathering the facts, “we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq,” said Biden, pledging to hold “all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing”.
Kirby would not speculate on the options being considered by the president, including whether targets inside Iran were on the table.
He said Washington wants to “make it clear” that the attack – part of a series of other increasingly dangerous assaults by Iran-backed militants in the region in recent weeks – was “unacceptable.”
UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron also joined Biden in blaming “Iran-aligned” militants and called on Tehran to “de-escalate the region.”
Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani has rejected the accusations as “baseless”, adding Tehran “is not involved in the decisions of the resistance groups”.
According to the BBC, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed it was behind the attack.
The group claimed to have launched three drone attacks at bases in Syria, including near the Jordanian border.

The group – a loose alliance of Iran-linked armed groups that oppose US support for Israel in the Gaza conflict and wants them out of Iraq – has claimed dozens of attacks on US and anti-jihadist coalition forces in Iraq.
‘Regional explosion’
A spokesperson for Iran-backed Hamas, Sami Abu Zuhri, said the Jordan attack was a message that the fighting in Gaza “risks a regional explosion”.
The US Central Command (CENTCOM) said late on Sunday the attack had hit the remote Tower 22 logistics support base and that 34 personnel were also wounded, eight of whom required evacuation.
There are around 350 US Army and Air Force personnel at the base who operate in support roles, including for the international coalition against the Islamic State jihadist group, CENTCOM said.
The escalating Middle East conflict poses a challenge to Biden in an election year, and Republican politicians were quick to take aim at him over the weekend.
US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria have been targeted in more than 150 attacks since mid-October, according to the Pentagon, and Washington has carried out retaliatory strikes in both countries.
The latest round of the Israel-Hamas conflict began when the Palestinian militant group carried out an unprecedented attack on 7 October that resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Israel retaliated with a relentless military offensive that has killed at least 26,637 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.
Anger over that campaign has grown across the region, with violence involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, as well as Yemen.
There have been near-daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel in Lebanon. US forces are directly involved in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
The United States and Britain have both carried out strikes targeting Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who have been attacking Red Sea shipping in support of Palestinians in Gaza for more than two months

A commission statement said the EU executive “will determine upcoming funding decisions for UNRWA in light of the very serious allegations made on 24 January relating to the involvement of UNRWA staff in the heinous 7 October attacks”.
It said that no additional funding to UNRWA “is foreseen until the end of February”.
However, it added that humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank “will continue unabated through partner organisations”.

Over the weekend, numerous countries, including the United States, France, Britain, Germany and Japan, suspended further funding to the UN agency.
The European Commission said it “will review the matter in light of the outcome of the investigation announced by the UN and the actions it will take”.
Israel has said it would seek to stop UNRWA from operating in Gaza after the conflict.
Hamas urged the international community to ignore Israel’s “threats”, while the Palestinian Authority said the agency needed “maximum support” from donors.
An Israeli document, which has been shared with US officials and was obtained by The Associated Press, lists 12 people, their alleged roles in the attack, and their job descriptions and photos.
The document said intelligence gathered showed that at least 190 UNRWA workers were Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives, without providing evidence.
It said of the 12 workers, nine were teachers and one was a social worker. Seven of the employees were accused of crossing into Israel on 7 October.
Of those, two were alleged to have kidnapped or assisted in the abduction of Israelis and another two were said to have participated in raids on communal farming villages, according to the document.
One was accused of arming himself with an anti-tank missile the night before the attack, while the document claimed another took photos of a female hostage.
Some were accused of “participating in a terror activity” or coordinating the movement of trucks or weapons used in the attack. Ten were listed as having ties to Hamas and one to the Islamic Jihad militant group.
The names and photos of the accused workers could not immediately be verified.
Two of the 12 have been killed, according to the document. The UN previously said one was still being identified.
In a statement, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said it is “deeply alarmed” by the decision of some countries to suspend their funding to UNRWA.
It said the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached “catastrophic levels” and that any additional limitations on aid “will result in more deaths and suffering”.
“Humanitarian organisations are already grappling to meet even a fraction of the urgent needs in Gaza,” the organisation said.
“Much more aid is required to meet those needs, not less. The consequences these cuts in funding will have on the ground contradict the provisional measures issued by the International Court of Justice on Friday (26 January), which include immediate measures to ensure sufficient humanitarian aid flows into Gaza.”
On Saturday, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said Ireland was not withdrawing its funding.
Speaking today, Martin said in relation to today’s announcement by the EU that he has no issue with the bloc reviewing the situation in light of what happened “once the aid keeps flowing”.
Martin said he will be advocating that all countries, including the US, restore support to UNRWA.
He added that he hopes US aid is restored ahead of Ireland’s visit to the White House on St Patrick’s Day.

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Martin said he had full confidence in Lazzarini and his decision to “immediately suspend” UNRWA workers “suspected of participation in the heinous attacks of October 7, to investigate thoroughly and show zero tolerance on terror”.
“UNRWA’s 13,000 employees provide life saving assistance to 2.3m people and at incredible personal cost – with over 100 staff killed in last 4 months,” Martin said.

Around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Hamas’s 7 October attack in southern Israel, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Militants of Hamas, considered a “terrorist” group by the US and EU, also seized 250 hostages, of whom Israel says around 132 remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead captives.
Israel’s relentless military offensive has since killed at least 26,422 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.
CIA chief William Burns met top Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials in Paris yesterday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the talks were “constructive” but pointed to “significant gaps which the parties will continue to discuss this week”.
US President Joe Biden sent Burns to try to negotiate the release of remaining hostages in exchange for a ceasefire, a security source confirmed to AFP.
The New York Times reported on Saturdaythat the negotiators were discussing a deal under which Israel would suspend the war for about two months in return for the release of over 100 hostages.
Reuters today reportedthat Hamas reiterated its view that releasing hostages it is holding would require a guaranteed end to the Israeli offensive in Gaza and withdrawal of all invasion forces.
“The success of the Paris meeting is dependent on the Occupation (Israel) agreeing to end the comprehensive aggression on Gaza Strip,” senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters.

US vows 'very consequential' response after military members killed in Jordan drone strike,"LAST UPDATE|29 Jan

THE UNITED STATES has vowed a ‘very consequential response’ to a drone attack on a base in Jordan that killed three American troops, with President Joe Bidenblaming Iran-backed militants.
The deaths have raised fears of an escalating conflict, as fighting still rages in Gaza. The attack marks the first US military deaths in an attack in the region since the Israel-Hamas war began.
Speaking to CNN’s Morning Joe, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the response from Washington would be “very consequential”.
“But we don’t seek a war with Iran. We’re not looking for a wider conflict in the Middle East,” he added.
While Washington is still gathering the facts, “we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq,” said Biden, pledging to hold “all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing”.
Kirby would not speculate on the options being considered by the president, including whether targets inside Iran were on the table.
He said Washington wants to “make it clear” that the attack – part of a series of other increasingly dangerous assaults by Iran-backed militants in the region in recent weeks – was “unacceptable.”
UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron also joined Biden in blaming “Iran-aligned” militants and called on Tehran to “de-escalate the region.”
Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani has rejected the accusations as “baseless”, adding Tehran “is not involved in the decisions of the resistance groups”.
According to the BBC, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed it was behind the attack.
The group claimed to have launched three drone attacks at bases in Syria, including near the Jordanian border.

The group – a loose alliance of Iran-linked armed groups that oppose US support for Israel in the Gaza conflict and wants them out of Iraq – has claimed dozens of attacks on US and anti-jihadist coalition forces in Iraq.
‘Regional explosion’
A spokesperson for Iran-backed Hamas, Sami Abu Zuhri, said the Jordan attack was a message that the fighting in Gaza “risks a regional explosion”.
The US Central Command (CENTCOM) said late on Sunday the attack had hit the remote Tower 22 logistics support base and that 34 personnel were also wounded, eight of whom required evacuation.
There are around 350 US Army and Air Force personnel at the base who operate in support roles, including for the international coalition against the Islamic State jihadist group, CENTCOM said.
The escalating Middle East conflict poses a challenge to Biden in an election year, and Republican politicians were quick to take aim at him over the weekend.
US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria have been targeted in more than 150 attacks since mid-October, according to the Pentagon, and Washington has carried out retaliatory strikes in both countries.
The latest round of the Israel-Hamas conflict began when the Palestinian militant group carried out an unprecedented attack on 7 October that resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Israel retaliated with a relentless military offensive that has killed at least 26,637 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.
Anger over that campaign has grown across the region, with violence involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, as well as Yemen.
There have been near-daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel in Lebanon. US forces are directly involved in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
The United States and Britain have both carried out strikes targeting Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who have been attacking Red Sea shipping in support of Palestinians in Gaza for more than two months

'This is complex': Tánaiste says he will be in touch with opposition parties on ICJ case,"TÁNAISTE AND MINISTER for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has said he has received “preliminary” legal briefings relating to whether Ireland should join South Africa’s genocide case against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
When asked byThe Journalfor an update on the Government’s deliberations, the Tánaiste said the situation is complex.
“The overall point I would make is that in Ireland there is a strong, unified position in terms of a humanitarian ceasefire. We were one of the first countries in the EU to call for such a humanitarian ceasefire, when many weren’t at the time.
“And likewise, we want to hold Israel to account and we wanted to hold Hamas to account for the conduct of the war in Gaza and also in terms of the Hamas attack on 7 October,” the Tánaiste said.
On Friday, the ICJ issued preliminary orders in the case taken by South Africa.
The preliminary order called on the state of Israel to do everything it can to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza. However, it fell short of calling for a ceasefire.

The preliminary orders also call on Israel to allow aid into Gaza
Speaking at the time, the Tánaiste said the Government would “strongly consider” supporting the case and that itwould receive“urgent” legal advice on the matter.
Sinn Féin will use its private members’ time in the Dáil tomorrow evening to put down a motion calling on Ireland to support South Africa’s case.
Martin said today: “I have been briefed preliminarily by my own legal team here in the department.
“This is complex. It’s not at all simple. We’re talking about the International Court of Justice, the Genocide Convention, and I will discuss this with all of the opposition parties because I think that they need to be apprised of what actually is involved here.”
The Tánaiste said Ireland has also been in touch with government officials from South Africa as well as with Irish officials in the Hague.
He said South Africa has not yet filed any substantive case and said the indication from South Africa’s officials is that it will take some months for them to do so.
“There’s a lot of work to be done yet so we will engage with the opposition parties.”

Mary Lou McDonald says Patrick's Day trip will let Ireland send 'clear message' to US on Gaza,"LAST UPDATE|29 Jan
SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has said that St Patrick’s Day will provide an opportunity for Ireland to send “a very clear message” to US leaders over the situation in Gaza.
Pressure is alsomounting on the partyto boycott its annual St Patrick’s Day trip to the United States in light of the American government’s support of Israel.Mary Lou McDonald travels to Washington DC annuallyfor the tradition.
Speaking to RTÉ’s News at One today, McDonald confirmed she would be attending.
“I believe [there is] a very important opportunity on this St Patrick’s Day, of all St Patrick’s Day, to bring a very clear message from Ireland to the United States in respect of Gaza, the West Bank, what has been happening in Palestine and to make that clear,” she said.
The Sinn Féin leader said the United States has been “on the wrong side of this for a very long time, that didn’t just emerge in October last”.
McDonald said she would “differ” with Eastwood on his stance regarding the St Patrick’s Day trip.
“It’s important that we’re there,” she said.
“President Biden and others need to be moved onto the correct path, which is in the first instance a path of ceasefire.”
Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O’Neill has also said the party’s St Patrick’s Day trip will be in “pursuit of peace”.

Pressure has been mounting in recent weeks for parties across the island of Ireland to boycott the St Patrick’s Day celebrations in the United States in light of the American government’s support of Israel.
The Irish Government hasbeen criticisedfor its unwavering commitment to the tradition.
People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy said that no politician should meet with Joe Biden or any members of the US administration for St Patrick’s Day “as long as this genocide is continuing, as long as the US is providing huge amounts of military and political support”.
Speaking earlier this month, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said that cancelling the trip to Washington over America’s support for Israel“doesn’t make sense”.
“You have to engage,” he said.
“The only way to increase pressure, the only way you can get a resolution on this is to get international pressure that is so overwhelming that there is a stop to the violence.”
Transport Minister Eamon Ryan said today that St Patrick’s Day events are an opportunity to “get that message out” to call for a Gaza ceasefire.
“I think it’s all the more important we go abroad this year to spread a message, our view, on Gaza and other issues,” Ryan said.
“That what’s happening is completely unacceptable, there has to be a ceasefire now,” he said.
“Why wouldn’t we use the opportunity of the global stage that we have on St Patrick’s Day to get that message out. I think that’s what we will and should do.”
However, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he will not attend the White House celebrations on St Patrick’s Day in protest at the situation in Gaza.

He said he will, however, send a party delegation to Washington DC to meet with senior lawmakers and leaders to “make a case for an end to violence” in the region.
Eastwood, who visited Khan Younis in 2012, said he “cannot in good conscience attend White House parties for St Patrick’s Day while the administration turns its face the other way and refuses to call for an immediate ceasefire”.
“I could not rub shoulders, drink Guinness, and have the craic while the horrifying impacts of the brutal war in Gaza continues. It would be the very opposite of solidarity with a people on the brink of destruction,” he said.
Eastwood said every leader will have to take their own decision on how they approach the St Patrick’s Day celebrations.
“I am offering no criticism of anyone else because there is no easy answer to any of this. But I know that my own conscience, and the values of the party I lead, are not consistent with celebration in the face of overwhelming violence,” the SDLP leader said.
Speaking of the decision to send a party delegation to Washington DC, Eastwood said that “it is in our party’s DNA to work toward peace wherever possible”.
“We will use our influence to press strongly for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas,” he said.
“I am not naive to the scale of the impact this action will have. But faced with the scenes of destruction across Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas of human habitation on our planet, I honestly believe it would be wrong to attend these celebrations and that not attending sends a far more powerful message,” Eastwood said.
“The first, and most important, principle of peace is that the killing must stop. The US has enormous influence over the pace of that first step in Gaza and southern Israel. I sincerely hope that they use it and join those of us calling for an immediate ceasefire soon.”

"US, Israel, Egypt, Qatar officials meet in Paris for Gaza talks","
THE HEAD OF the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as well as top Egyptian, Qatari and Israeli officials met in Paris today to discuss a ceasefire in Gaza.
French authorities were also in touch with the four countries with the aim of negotiating a halt to hostilities between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the besieged territory, sources said.
Israel said late Sunday that the discussions in Paris, attended by the heads of its Mossad intelligence agency and Shin Bet security agency, had been “constructive”.
But “there are still significant gaps which the parties will continue to discuss this week in additional mutual meetings,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said.
A security source on Friday told AFP that CIA chief William Burns would meet his counterparts from Israel and Egypt, as well as Qatar’s prime minister “in the coming days”.
The source confirmed a report in The Washington Post last week that US President Joe Biden was sending Burns to try to negotiate the release of remaining Hamas-held Israeli hostages in exchange for a ceasefire.

The New York Times said on yesterday that US-led negotiators were getting closer to an agreement under which Israel would suspend its war in Gaza for about two months in return for the release of more than 100 hostages.
Quoting unidentified US officials, it said negotiators had developed a draft agreement that would be discussed in Paris on Sunday.
US President Joe Biden spoke on Friday with Qatar’s emir to discuss efforts to free the hostages, the White House said, however warning “imminent developments” were unlikely.
Qatar is playing a key role in the latest talks after brokering a hostage release deal in November.
Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages and Israel says around 132 of them remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead captives.

UN Security Council to meet after ICJ ruling on South Africa's case against Israel,"LAST UPDATE|27 Jan
THE UN SECURITY Council will meet next week over the decision by the global body’s top court calling for Israel to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, the council’s presidency has announced.
The Wednesday meeting was called for by Algeria, whose ministry of foreign affairs said it would give “binding effect to the pronouncement of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the provisional measures imposed on the Israeli occupation.”
The Court yesterday said Israel must do everything it can to “prevent the commission of all acts within the scope” of the Genocide Convention.
It said Israel must take “all measures within its power toprevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide”.
It also said that Israel must take “immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians”.
Additionally, the court ruled that Israel must try to limit death and damage in Gaza.

Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour said that the ICJ decision “gives the clear message that in order to do all the things that they are asking for, you need a ceasefire for it to happen”.
“So fasten your seat belts,” he said, hinting that the Arab Group, represented on the council by Algeria, would push for one.
The Security Council, long divided on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, has only agreed to two resolutions since the 7 October Hamas attacks sparked the latest round of fighting.
In December, it demanded aid deliveries “at scale” to Gaza’s besieged population, while Israel’s ally the United States has kept out calls for a ceasefire despite international pressure.
The current fighting started with the unprecedented attack by Hamas that resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages and Israel says around 132 of them remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead captives.
Israel has vowed to crush Hamas and launched a military offensive that the health ministry in Gaza says has killed at least 26,083 people, about 70 percent of them women and children.
In reaction to the judgment the British government said it had “considerable concerns” about the ruling.

“We respect the role and independence of the ICJ. However… we have considerable concerns about this case, which is not helpful in the goal of achieving a sustainable ceasefire,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement.
“Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas in line with IHL (international humanitarian law),” the spokesperson added.
“Our view is that Israel’s actions in Gaza cannot be described as genocide, which is why we thought South Africa’s decision to bring the case was wrong and provocative.”
Large crowdsgathered outside Leinster Houseon Wednesday calling for the Irish government to publicly support South Africa’s genocide case against Israel.
The government had said it was waiting until the case passed the preliminary stage before it showed support for it – a decision that sparked outrage among the publicand the opposition.

UN agency for Palestinian refugees sacks employees over claims of involvement in Hamas attack,"SEVERAL EMPLOYEES from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees have been fired after being accused by Israel of involvement in Hamas’s 7 October attack.
In a statement today, the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) commissioner-general said Israel had provided the agency with information about the alleged involvement of several employees in the attack.
“To protect the agency’s ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members and launch an investigation in order to establish the truth without delay,” Philippe Lazzarini said.
He voted to hold “accountable, including through criminal prosecution,” any UNRWA found to be involved in the “acts of terror”.
In response to the firings, UN chief Antonio Guterres pledged to conduct an “urgent and comprehensive independent review of UNRWA”, his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
The US State Department saidit had “temporarily paused additional funding” for UNRWA while it “reviews these allegations and the steps the United Nations is taking to address them”.
“The United States is extremely troubled by the allegations that 12 UNRWA employees may have been involved in the 7 October Hamas terrorist attack in Israel,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

Miller noted that the agency “plays a critical role in providing lifesaving assistance to Palestinians, including essential food, medicine, shelter and other vital humanitarian support”.
“Their work has saved lives, and it is important that UNRWA address these allegations and take any appropriate corrective measures, including reviewing existing policies and prosedures,” he said.
The US has contacted the Government of Israel to seek further information about the allegations and members of Congress have been briefed on the matter.
Israel’s foreign ministry said today it was “expecting an urgent investigation” of the agency on the involvement of its employees in the attack.
Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said the sackings proved long-standing claims that “UNRWA employees are collaborators of the terrorist organisation Hamas”.
Relations between Israel and UNRWA have deteriorated further in recent days, after the UN agency said tank shelling hit a shelter for displaced people in Gaza’s main southern city of Khan Yunis.
The agency said tens of thousands of displaced people had been registered at the shelter and tank shelling on Wednesday killed 13 people.
Asked about the incident, the Israeli army said “a thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is underway”, adding it was examining the possibility that the strike was a “result of Hamas fire”.
Lazzarini slammed Wednesday’s bombardment as a “blatant disregard of basic rules of war”, with the compound clearly marked as a UN facility and its coordinates shared with Israeli authorities.

The Israeli army is the only force known to have tanks operating in the Gaza Strip.
An UNRWA spokeswoman confirmed testimony from displaced people in the shelter who said the army gave them until 5pm (3pm Irish time) today to flee.
AFP reported it was not able to confirm the situation today at the shelter.
The unprecedented October 7 Hamas attack resulted in the death of around 1,140 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages and Israel says around 132 of them remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 dead captives.
At least 26,083 Palestinians, around 70% of them women, young children and adolescents, have been killed in the Gaza Strip in Israeli bombardments and ground offensive since then, according to the Gaza health ministry.

THE INTERNATIONAL COURT of Justice has this afternoon issued a preliminary ruling on South Africa’s case against Israel alleging genocide in Gaza.
The court has said Israel should do everything it could to prevent any acts of genocide in the Gaza Strip. The ICJ, however, fell short of calling for a ceasefire.
Opposition parties here havecriticised the Irish Government’sstance towards the case, and a motion tocompell the Government to support South Africa’s case was defeated in the Dáil earlier this week.
The preferred position of the Irish Government has been to wait and see what the Court decides today before choosing to get involved directly, although Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said South Africa’s case is “valid”.

26 Jan11:02AMIsrael's national carrier to stop South Africa routeIsrael’s national airline, El Al, today said it will scrap direct flights to South Africa following “a significant fall in demand by Israeli travellers” to the country and other destinations.“From the end of March 2024, El Al will suspend its operations on the Johannesburg-Tel Aviv route,” an El Al statement said.The announcement comes hours before the ICJ is set to issue an initial ruling on South Africa’s case against Israel over alleged genocidal acts in Gaza.The final El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Johannesburg is set to depart on March 27, according to the airline’s website.The case brought by South Africa in the top United Nations court has signficantly strained relations with Israel, which denies accusations its military campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide against Palestinians.In it’s midday ruling, the ICJ could order Israel to stop its ground offensive and bombardment of Gaza, or permit more humanitarian aid to enter the territory.26 Jan11:12AMWhat measures can the ICJ take today?South Africa has asked the ICJ to impose nine orders on Israel, including to immediately suspend military activity and to enable more humanitarian access to Gaza.The court could order all nine of the orders, none of them, or even make up its own completely different orders.Israel argued during the hearings that a ceasefire was unrealistic as the court could only order that on one party, since Hamas is not part of the proceedings.However, Hamas said on the eve of the ruling that it would abide by a ceasefire order if Israel did the same.Speaking toThe Journal,Michael Becker, Assistant Professor of International Human Rights Law at Trinity College Dublin, said: “Whenever these rulings come out, the thing is to go back and see what exactly did the party requesting the measures ask for?“And what did they (the Court) do?

Israel’s national airline, El Al, today said it will scrap direct flights to South Africa following “a significant fall in demand by Israeli travellers” to the country and other destinations.
“From the end of March 2024, El Al will suspend its operations on the Johannesburg-Tel Aviv route,” an El Al statement said.
The announcement comes hours before the ICJ is set to issue an initial ruling on South Africa’s case against Israel over alleged genocidal acts in Gaza.
The final El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Johannesburg is set to depart on March 27, according to the airline’s website.
The case brought by South Africa in the top United Nations court has signficantly strained relations with Israel, which denies accusations its military campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide against Palestinians.
In it’s midday ruling, the ICJ could order Israel to stop its ground offensive and bombardment of Gaza, or permit more humanitarian aid to enter the territory.
South Africa has asked the ICJ to impose nine orders on Israel, including to immediately suspend military activity and to enable more humanitarian access to Gaza.
The court could order all nine of the orders, none of them, or even make up its own completely different orders.
Israel argued during the hearings that a ceasefire was unrealistic as the court could only order that on one party, since Hamas is not part of the proceedings.
However, Hamas said on the eve of the ruling that it would abide by a ceasefire order if Israel did the same.
Speaking toThe Journal,Michael Becker, Assistant Professor of International Human Rights Law at Trinity College Dublin, said: “Whenever these rulings come out, the thing is to go back and see what exactly did the party requesting the measures ask for?
“And what did they (the Court) do? Because they’re not limited to agreeing or disagreeing with what was requested. They can create their own.”
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already hinted he does not feel bound by the court.
But regardless of Israel’s reaction, the ruling will have important “ripple effects”, said Juliette McIntyre, a lecturer in international law at the University of South Australia.
If the court rules there is a “risk” of genocide, McIntyre said that “makes it much harder for other states to continue to support Israel… states may withdraw military or other support”.
ICJ rulings are binding but it has little way of enforcing them and some states ignore them completely.
Russia was ordered by the ICJ to stop its invasion of Ukraine, for example.
In its filing, South Africa said it is “acutely aware” of the “particular weight of responsibility” in accusing Israel, of all countries, of breaking the Genocide Convention.
But it also says that no attack can justify alleged breaches of the convention and that Israel has “its own obligation” as a signatory to prevent genocide.
South Africa has long been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, with the governing African National Congress (ANC) often linking it to its own struggle against apartheid.
South Africa and Israel have in the past cut off diplomatic ties over the issue.
Our reporter David MacRedmond spoke to Michael Becker, Assistant Professor of International Human Rights Law at Trinity College Dublin,ahead of today’s ruling.
In a further post on X, formerly Twitter, Becker notes that it is “essential to keep in mind that the Court operates within the confines of its own jurisdiction and the limits of international law”.
“It is not a political pawn operating at the behest of powerful states,” he adds.

The judges have taken their seats and are now delivering their interim ruling.
The ICJ has begun ruling on the on landmark Israel-Gaza case.
Presiding Jodge Joan Donoghue is speaking now.
She has said the court is “acuately aware of the extent of the human tradegy” unfolding in Gaza.
“The court considers that the parties appear to hold clearly opposite views as to whether certain acts or omissions allegedly committed by Israel or Gaza amounted violations by the latter of its obligations under the Genocide Convention,” Judge Donoghue said.
“The court finds that the aforementioned elements are sufficient at this stage, to establish prima facia, the existence of a dispute between the parties, relating to the interpretation, application or fulfillment of the Genocide Convention.”
The ICJ has dismissed Israel’s request that the case be removed.
Judge Donoghue has said the Palestinians appear to be a protected group under the convention.

Judge Donoghue highlighted that during the ongoing conflict, senior United Nations officials have “repeatedly called attention to the risk of further deterioration of conditions in the Gaza Strip”.
She said the court takes note, for instance, of the letter dated 6 December 2023, whereby the Secretary General of the United Nations brought the following information to the attention of the Security Council: “I quote, ‘the health care system in Gaza is collapsing. Nowhere is safe in Gaza, Amid constant bombardment by the Israel Defense Forces, and without shelter or the essentials to survive, I expect public order to break down soon due to the desperate conditions rendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible and an even worse situation could unfold, including epidemic diseases and increase pressure for mass displacement into neighboring countries’.”
The court has ruled 15-2 that Israel shall “take all measures within its power” to prevent the commission of all acts “within the scope of Article Two of the [Genocide] Convention”.
This includes, “A, killing members of the group, B, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, C, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, D, imposing measures, intended to prevent birth within the group”.
The court has also ruled that Israel must take “immediate and effective” measures to ensure the providing of “urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance” to Gaza.
The court has also ruled that Israel must take all measures within its power to prevent and punish direct and public incitement to commit genocide in relation to members of the Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip.
It should be noted that the ICJ has today stopped short of calling for a ceasefire within Gaza.
The hearing has concluded.
Here’s a quick catch up…
Today’s decision is only an interim one; it could take years for the full case brought by South Africa to be considered.
While the case winds its way through the court, South Africa had asked the judges “as a matter of extreme urgency” to impose provisional measures.
Top of the South African list was a request for the court to order Israel to “immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza”.
But the court stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.
South Africa also asked for Israel to take “reasonable measures” to prevent genocide and allow access for desperately needed aid.
The court said Israel must do everything to “prevent the commission of all acts within the scope” of the Genocide Convention.
It also said Israel must take “all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide”.
Israel also must take “immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians,” the ICJ ruled.
The court ruled that Israel must try to limit death and damage.
South Africa has hailed the ruling by the court.
“Today marks a decisive victory for the international rule of law and a significant milestone in the search for justice for the Palestinian people,” the foreign ministry said.

'Same energy as Russia': Two of Ireland's Eurovision hopefuls say Israel should be cut from contest,"TWO OF IRELAND’S six Eurovision hopefuls, who will compete tonight to represent Ireland in the competition, have said Israel should be removed from the song contest.
Artists Erica-Cody and Bambie Thug have both said Israel should not be allowed to compete in this year’s contest because of the Israeli state’s actions in Gaza.
Erica-Cody did not rule out boycotting the competition entirely if she secures the position to represent Ireland.
To date, over 25,000 people have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza following Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel which killed more than 1,200 people.
Later today, the International Court of Justice willpublish its preliminary rulingin the genocide case taken by South Africa against Israel.
Tonight, RTÉ’s Late Late Showwill host aEurosong special where it will choose Ireland’s entry for the 2024 competition which will be held in Malmö, Sweden.
Erica-Cody and Bambie Thug are among thesix actsthat will tonight compete to represent Ireland in the song contest in May.
Both will contest alongside artists AILSHA, JyellowL (AKA Jean-Luc Uddoh), Isabella Kearney and Louis Walsh’s boyband, Next in Line.
Bambie ThugAndres PovedaAndres Poveda
Bookmakers are favouring Erica-Cody for a win tonight with her song Love Me Like I Do. She is trailed by Ailsha with her Irish language song Go Tobann and Bambie Thug with their song Doomsday Blue.
Ahead of tonight’s song contest there has been apersistent campaignby activists demanding that Ireland boycott the competition in protest over Israel’s involvement.
As of earlier this month, RTÉ had received over 600 emails asking it to boycott the competition.
Those in favour of a boycott say the organisers of the Eurovision, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), set the precedent for such an exclusion in 2022 when it did not allow Russia to compete after its invasion of Ukraine.
Ahead of tonight’s competition,The Journalsought the views of all six contestants on the boycott campaign.
Speaking at a press event in RTÉ, Erica-Cody and Bambie Thug both took the view that Israel should not be allowed to compete.
“We need to see the same energy that was given to Russia when they invaded Ukraine, it should be the exact same,” Erica-Cody said.
The former Dancing With The Stars contestant said the situation in Gaza is devastating.
“Personally, I’ve found it really disturbing and distressing to watch. And I’ve been very vocal about it,” she said.

When asked if Israel should be removed from the contest the singer said: “If I’m going to be 100% honest? Yeah.
“I think it’s an absolute disgrace. This is meant to be a celebration of life and music, and acceptance and love.”
When asked if she would consider boycotting the competition if she wins tonight and Israel is not removed from the competition Erica-Cody said: “We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.
“But I think anybody who knows me and knows me morally over the last couple of years being an activist should know that I would never step into something like this with an ignorant head on my shoulders.”
Fellow contestant Bambie Thug, who like Erica-Cody is one of the favourites to win, also said they do not think Israel should be allowed compete.
Bambie Thug said the same approach taken with Russia should be applied to Israel.
The non-binary artist, who lists Lady Gaga and Black Sabbath among their top influences added however: “It’s not down to the contestants though, it’s down to the Eurovision itself.”
Other contestants preferred not to share their views on the Boycott movement.
Ailsha, who has promised “exploding toilets” on stage tonight as part of her performance, which she has said will resemble a “leaving cert fever dream”, toldThe Journalthat while she is appalled at what is happening in the Middle East, she had nothing else to say on the matter.
AILSHARTÉRTÉ
Tonight will be the first time Late Late Show host Patrick Kielty will take the helm of the Eurosong contest.
Sharing his views on the boycott movement, Kielty said he didn’t feel like it was his place to weigh in on whether Israel should be excluded from the competition.
“I’m not in the EBU. They’re the people that make that decision. I’m not a representative of Eurovision.
“You know, I happily talked about this on the show before, I think what’s going on in Gaza at the minute is heartbreaking… but in terms of this it’s somebody else’s question,” Kielty said.
Yesterday, RTÉpublished a reporton Toy Show The Musical, which was a flop for RTÉ making a loss of €2.2 million.
Kielty was asked if he felt the damning report had a negative impact on the Toy Show brand.
He said he didn’t think it did.
Kielty, who was at this stage being ushered away by RTÉ staff for a rehearsal added: “If you look at that report, there’s lots of mistakes. If we were going into what those are, there wouldn’t be a rehearsal this afternoon. So, you know, there’s not really much point getting into the specifics.”
The Late Late Eurosong Special airs tonight, Friday 25th January, 9:35pm on RTÉ One and RTÉ Player.

The ICJ makes its initial ruling in the Israel genocide case today - what's likely to happen?,"THE FIFTEEN JUDGES of the International Court of Justice have concluded the first phase of deliberations over South Africa’s case against Israel in The Hague, Netherlands. A decision on South Africa’s request that the Court issue emergency injunctions against Israel ahead of the actual trial is due to be published at midday today.
A Social Democrats motion that would have compelled the Government to officially support South Africa’s case wasdefeated in the Dáilearlier this week, as opposition parties continue tocriticise the Government’sstance.
The preferred position of the Government has been to wait and see what the Court decides on provisional (emergency) measures before choosing to get involved directly, although Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said South Africa’s case is “valid”.
It’s been two weeks since the two countries’ legal teams madetheir opening argumentsinpreliminary hearingson 11 and 12 January, and almost a month since South Africa filed its 84-page application to the Court, in which it accused Israel of violating the Genocide Convention.
In its application, and in the words of its five legal representatives at the hearing, South Africa accused Israel of committing acts of genocide, failing to prevent genocide, and failing to prevent and punish incitement to genocide since the beginning of its siege, bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza following the Hamas-led attacks against Israel on 7 October.
South Africa also placed this latest, most destructive Israeli military campaign within the historical context of Palestinian dispossession, displacement and occupation in the years since the founding of the Israeli state in 1948, the same year the Genocide Convention was drafted.
The Israeli legal team responded to South Africa’s arguments by urging the Court to dismiss the case and the requests for provisional measures “out of hand”, calling the accusations “libellous” and arguing that Israel has done everything in its power to prevent the killing of civilians during its military campaign in Gaza.
“I think it is tragic and appalling that South Africa has decided to play advocate for the devil and serve as the legal arm of Hamas,” Israeli spokesperson Eylon Levy told the BBC on 11 January. The Israeli legal team made similar statements in court the following day.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to continue the military campaign in Gaza, regardless of what the ICJ might rule today.
“Nobody will stop us – not The Hague, not the axis of evil and not anybody else,” he said on 13 January.
Israel’s siege, bombardment and ground invasion has now killed more than 25,000 people in the Gaza Strip since 8 October.

How does the Court make decisions?
Since preliminary hearings ended two weeks ago, the Court’s judges have been poring over the evidence and arguments put forth by both sides while composing a draft of its rulings.
“The court goes through a fairly rigorous process of meeting together in plenary to revise that text until there is majority agreement on a final text,” explains Michael Becker, Assistant Professor of International Human Rights Law at Trinity College Dublin.
In decisions like these, the Court typically votes on each provisional measure separately, with a simple majority needed for a measure to be adopted.
Once the judges’ decision is made public this afternoon, comparing any provisional measure orders it issues with those requested in South Africa’s application will be the immediate task of the two legal teams, their governments and observers around the world.
“That’s a big thing,” says Becker. “Whenever these come out, the thing is to go back and see what exactly did the party requesting the measures ask for? And what did they (the Court) do? Because they’re not limited to agreeing or disagreeing with what was requested. They can create their own.
“So often things will get left out. They might impose most of the measures but not some, and then they might change the scope of some of the measures.”
How might the Court rule today?
Becker does not foresee the Court adopting South Africa’s requests wholesale.
“It would not surprise me for the Court to direct Israel to ensure that military operations are in compliance with international law, or with the Genocide Convention specifically,” he says.
While Becker says such a ruling would be dissatisfactory for many, “the fact that the Court is saying it in the first place, should be understood as a very strong statement of concern on the Court’s part”, and a signal that Israel should show greater restraint.
“People can disagree vehemently about the nature of Israel’s response, but I think most people would be hard pressed to argue that Israel doesn’t have genuine security needs.”
“The judges are not stupid,” he says, pointing to the example of the Ukraine vs Russia case, where the Court issued provisional measures ordering Russia to stop its invasion.

“The Court would have issued that order in the knowledge that Russia was unlikely to comply, which turned out to be the case.”
What has happened in other genocide cases?
Each case at the ICJ involving the Genocide Convention has its own unique characteristics, but there have been instances, like the Ukraine case, where the Court has issued provisional measures in line with those requested in a state’s application.
For a number of reasons though, the case of South Africa vs Israel is different.
“There’s no case that’s exactly like it,” says Becker.
Other cases involving the Genocide Convention offer possible outcomes, too, ones in which the Court did not order the measures requested by the applicant countries.
In 2019, Gambia fileda case against Myanmarat the ICJ accusing its government of committing genocide against the Rohingya people, a minority ethnic group in Myanmar. The Court did not adopt Gambia’s requested measures in that case, instead opting to essentially signal to Myanmar that it must abide by the law.
“That was dissatisfying to many people because of course, that’s what the whole case is about, is Myanmar complying with the Genocide Convention? So to order them to simply do it, they would say, ‘well we are’.
“Many people saw that as underwhelming,” says Becker.
Today’s announcement may well receive a similar response.

Dutch defender Derrick Luckassen was Tel Aviv’s hero with the winning penalty in the shootout, sealing the club’s first win in Israel’s secondary cup competition since 2021.
The trophy is the first part of a potential domestic treble for Tel Aviv, who enter the State Cup this weekend at the last-32 stage.
They currently sit on top of the Israeli Premier Division, one point clear of defending champions Haifa.
Tel Aviv are also safely through to the last 16 of the Europa Conference League having topped a group that featured Gent of Belgium, Zorya Luhansk of Ukraine, and Breidablik of Iceland.

Keane wasappointed by Tel Avivin June last year, but the move has met with some criticism in light of the continuing conflict between Israel and Hamas, with Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald among those to speak out against it.
Asked about Keane’s position last month,Taoiseach Leo Varadkar saidthat the former Ireland striker’s decision was “a matter for him”.

Interim ruling in ICJ Gaza genocide case due Friday as demonstration held outside Dáil,"LARGE CROWDS GATHERED outside Leinster House this evening to demand that the Irish government publicly supports South Africa’s genocide case against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
The Court indicated this evening that it will deliver its preliminary ruling on the case this Friday at 1pm Dutch time (noon, Irish time).
If granted, the ruling will likely order Israel to announce a ceasefire in Gaza and allow more UN humanitarian aid into the country.
The Irish government has said it is waiting until the case has passed the preliminary stage before it shows support for it, but opposition parties saythis is not enough.
A Social Democrats motion has called on the government to join the case against Israel in the ICJ at the earliest opportunity but a counter motion put down by the government agrees to “strongly consider” an intervention in the case “as a matter of urgency” after the Court has made its preliminary ruling.
A vote on the matter will be held in the Dáil tonight.
Outside Leinster House, a large crowd gathered from 5.30pm calling on the government to support the Social Democrats’ motion.
The crowd was addressed by a number of speakers including opposition politicians; Gary Gannon; Richard Boyd Barrett; Ivana Bacik and Independent senator Francis Black.

Claire Houlihan from Mothers Against Genocide told the crowd that the Irish government is failing the children of Palestine.
“Being born as a Palestinian means being born into a life controlled entirely by the Israeli military occupation,” she said.

Houlihan said: “Boycotts, divest and sanction Israel, it’s the only way.
Actor Liam Cunningham also addressed the demonstration and read the crowd a poem by murdered Palestinian poet and writer, Refaat Alareer. Alareer was killed by Israeli forces in December.
Irish singer and People Before Profit representative Eoghan Ó Ceannabháin took to the platform after a number of speeches to sing the Irish traditional song ‘Oró, Sé Do Bheatha ‘Bhaile’.
Jane MatthewsJane Matthews
Introducing the song, Ó Ceannabháin noted how it was one from Ireland’s own anti-imperial and anti-colonial tradition.
“We’ve been singing it on the marches over the last few weeks in solidarity with the Palestinian people and the Palestinian resistance,” he told the crowd.
Ó Ceannabháin explained how the chorus of the song is a blessing meaning “safe journey home” and said it was being sung for Palestinians to return to their homeland and to be free.
Zaid Al-Barghouthi from the Union of Students in Ireland, one of the organisers of today’s demonstration, told the crowd that the leaders of the Irish coalition government – Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Micheál Martin and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan “cannot claim to be making their ancestors proud”.
Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon told those gathered that it was because of their advocacy that the Irish government had begun to shift its position on supporting the South Africa case.
“But yet still, we need to drag them further,” he said, adding that the language used in the government counter motion was “cowardly”.
Gannon said the Irish government and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin was operating under an “illusion” of statesmanship and promised to come back week after week if tonight’s motion didn’t pass.
The demonstration was organised by a coalition of anti-war groups and Palestine solidarity activists.
These included the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC), Mothers Against Genocide, Academics for Palestine, Palestinian Rights Institute, Irish Anti-War Movement, Palestinian Rights’ Institute and Action for Palestine Ireland.

"Palestinian man in group waving white flag is shot dead in Gaza, ITV footage shows","A PALESTINIAN MAN walking in a group waving a white flag was shot dead in Gaza by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), ITV News is reporting.
A cameraman working for the media outlet was filming scenes in Gaza when the incident occurred.
The footage shows a group of men walking on a footpath close to a combat zone.
They have their hands up and are visiblywaving a white flag, the international symbol of a truce.
ITV News said the men were unarmed.
Speaking on camera one of the men, Ramzi Abu Sahloul, said the group was trying to reach his mother and brother to escort them out of harm’s way.
He is quoted as saying: “I have my mother and brother in there, with around 50 or 70 displaced people in another house.
“The Israelis came to us and told us to evacuate but they didn’t let my brother out. We want to go and try to get them out, god willing.”

Gunfire can be heard in the background and large plumes of black smoke from the ongoing assault are visible in the footage.
When the interview was complete, the cameraman walked away.
Shortly afterwards, the cameraman was filming the men walking further down the street. A member of the group is still waving the white flag.
A number of bullets are fired in the men’s direction by someone off camera.

Ramzi Abu Sahloul is shot and collapses. The other men place the white flag on his chest and carry him away. The white flag quickly turns red with blood.
The men carried their friend awayITV NewsITV News
The 51-year-old husband and father wasn’t moving and it seems his death was almost instantaneous, ITV News reports.
The other men carried his body to a safer place. His widow is filmed running towards her husband’s body and is incredibly distressed.
IDF denial
In response to a request from ITV News, the IDF said it categorically denies any existence of “field executions”.
An IDF statement notes: “It is imperative to emphasise that the alarming, libelous and a gross mischaracterisation of the war with these despicable accusations can only be deemed as an extension of Hamas’ propaganda effort to defame the IDF and undermine our objective to dismantle Hamas and ensure the terrorist entity never again holds the power to build a terrorist army, invade Israel, murder, burn, rape and abduct Israelis.”
The IDF has been accused of killing people waving white flags in the past.
In December, the IDF confirmed that three Israeli hostages – who had been waving a white flag and were shirtless – were “mistakenly” shot dead by Israeli troops.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza today said that at least 25,700 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the conflict with Israel started on 7 October.
A ministry statement said at least 210 people were killed over the past 24 hours, while another 63,740 have been wounded since the war began.
The offensive began in response to the unprecedented attack by Hamas fighters on 7 October that resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
The militant group also seized about 250 hostages during the attack, with around 132 still remaining in Gaza.

Sunak says UK and US plan to impose new sanctions over Red Sea attacks,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Rishi Sunak has said the UK and US intend to impose new sanctions in response to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.
Sunak warned the Yemen-based military group that the UK plans to continue to launch strikes if attacks on ships in the Red Sea continue.
The Houthis, who control significant parts of Yemen along the coast of the Red Sea, have beentargeting cargo shipsen route to Israel in retaliation against Israel’s attacks on Gaza, where more than 25,000 people have been killed since October.
Royal Air Force jets struck two military sites last night north of Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, that the UK said covered multiple specific targets used by the Houthis to support their attacks on shipping.
Sunak addressed the House of Commons in Westminster this afternoon about the Israel-Hamas war and the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.
He said that the UK government is not “seeking a confrontation” but “if necessary, will not hesitate to respond again in self-defence” to the Houthis.
“At my order overnight, the RAF engaged in a second wave of strikes against Houthi military targets in Yemen.
“We did so because we continue to see, including in intelligence, an ongoing and imminent threat from the Houthis to UK commercial and military vessels, and to those of our partners in the Red Sea and wider region.”
Sunak said new sanctions would be announced “in the coming days” in response to Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, adding: “We must end the illegal flow of arms to the Houthi militia.”
The British government’s plans include “working closely with our allies and partners to disrupt and deter the supply of weapons and components”.
“We are going to use the most effective means at our disposal to cut off the Houthis’ financial resources where they are used to fund these attacks,” Sunak said.

Jeremy Quin, Conservative chairman of the Defence Select Committee, asked Sunak whether he believes that the UK may need to conduct a “prolonged and persistent, targeted campaign” against the Houthis.
In response, Sunak said: “I just want to be absolutely clear that no decision has been taken to embark on a sustained campaign of the nature that he mentioned. These were limited strikes specifically in response to threats we have perceived.
“But we do reserve the right to take action in self-defence, as I have said. But crucially the military action is just one part of a broader strategy, diplomatic, sanctions and others. We will use all levers to bring about an end to the disruption and the illegality the Houthis are causing.”
SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn called on government ministers to reveal their “ultimate strategy” for dealing with conflict in the Middle East, saying MPs “need to be mindful of the opponent that we face in this regard”
“The Houthis have been under almost constant bombardment from Saudi Arabia for the best part of eight years. They didn’t get that message, so why are we so confident that they will get our message this time around?” Flynn said.
Sunak insisted that strikes carried out last week and again last night were effective in “degrading capability and all the intended targets were destroyed”.
Labour MP Apsana Begum criticised the decision to strike Yemen, saying that “further violence will not achieve peace” and that “aid agencies are warning that the UK-US continuing to bomb Yemen is threatening civilian populations and limiting humanitarian assistance from reaching millions who are already enduring starvation”.
“Instead of escalating risks to civilian populations in the region, why can’t the Prime Minister just support the growing and increasing calls internationally for an immediate ceasefire in Israel-Gaza, an end to the bloodshed with Gaza, an end to the attacks on Yemen, and call for peace, justice and human rights?” Begum asked.
Sunak in response said that the situations in the Red Sea and Gaza “are two completely different things” and claimed “our NGO partners have confirmed no significant disruption to humanitarian efforts following our air strikes”.
The UK’s Foreign Secretary David Cameron is set travel to the region “in the coming days” in a bid to increase diplomatic engagement.
MPs are set to have a full debate on the UK’s approach to the Red Sea tomorrow.

"Boycotting St Patrick’s trip to US over Gaza ‘doesn’t make sense’, says Tánaiste","BOYCOTTING THE ST Patrick’s Day trip to Washington over America’s support for Israel would not make sense, according to the Tánaiste Micheál Martin.
Speaking on his way into Cabinet this morning, he said it is important to have engagement on such matters.
“That doesn’t make sense. You have to engage.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is due to make the trip stateside in March for the St Patrick’s Day celebrations. McDonaldalso travels to the US and Washington DCannually to mark the event.
Martin told reporters today:
“The only way to increase pressure, the only way you can get a resolution on this is to get international pressure that is so overwhelming that there is a stop to the violence.
“It is clear that the US administration is now seeking to not only get an end to violence, but also to create political track to ensure that there is a Palestinian state, that we get a two-state solution to this.
“People take this very seriously and people are very worried about what is happening in the Middle East, not least because too many citizens are being killed and too many children are being killed, but also regional escalation is happening.
“We have the Houthis firing missiles at unarmed merchant ships, disrupting trade and economy. We are worried about what could in Lebanon. This could get much worse and therefore everyone is seized by the gravity what is happening in Palestine.
His comments come after last week’s calls from People Before Profit for all Irish politicians, including the Taoiseach and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald to boycott the trip stateside this year.

People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy said last week that the Irish government boycotting the St Patrick’s Day trip to the White House would be a message that would be sent around the world.
He sid the Taoiseach presenting th bowl of shamrock to the US President is “enormously symbolic”, stating that the eventshould not happen this yeargiven that the US is the number one supporter of Israel in the conflict against Palestine.
The Sinn Féin leader toldThe Journalin Decemberthat she would not be in favour of boycotting the St Patrick’s Day visit to the White House over US support for Israel’s offensive in Gaza.
When asked if the situation carries on into the new year, and the US continues its support for Israel’s bombardment of Palestine, would she be supportive of calls to boycott the traditional St Patrick’s Day visit to Washington DC, she said:
“I think you need to be very careful about any idea of boycotting, the Irish relationship with the United States is a very long standing one, a very valuable one, on many, many dimensions.
“I think we need to be clear that that relationship for us is valuable, not least in terms of the evolution of our own peace process. But I certainly accept, and I have no doubt that the American system, if you listen to President Biden recently, he has acknowledged himself that Israel has lost the world.
“They have lost world opinion, for the simple reason that that no reasoned person, irrespective of the political spectrum they’re on, could witness that. Just stop, this has to stop.
“So I don’t think anybody should imagine that anybody in the American system is in any way confused about the Sinn Féin stance as regards Palestine, or indeed the Irish stance, the Irish public opinion on Palestine. And it’s interesting, if you look stateside, it’s different now. American public opinion is in a different place than it would have been saying a decade ago on this on this question,” said the Dublin Central TD.
McDonald said she spoke to the US ambassador to Ireland “quite recently” and other US officials where “the issue of Palestine did come up”.
“They know full well our analysis. I’m not shy about sharing it with them… America is very much on the right side of things in terms of the Irish peace process. I would like to see the United States very much on the right side of building peace in the Middle East,” she said.

Debunked: Ceann Comhairle did not say immigrants were responsible for rising antisemitism,"
REPORTS THAT SEÁN Ó Fearghaíl, the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann, had blamed immigrants for rising levels of antisemitism in Ireland during a speech were mis-reported.
Recordings of the comments, which are not easily accessible, show that Ó Fearghaíl in fact said that rising antisemitism was connected to rising anti-immigrant sentiment.
“The Ceann Comhairle is being quoted as saying that migrants and the extreme left are responsible for an upsurge in anti-semitism in Ireland,” People Before Profit–Solidarity TD Paul Murphywrote on Twitterlast night. “This is absolutely scandalous.”
Murphy includes a screenshot from website of The Jewish Chronicle, a London-based outlet that describes itself as the “oldest and most influential Jewish newspaper”.
The story largely focuses on a visit to Auschwitz death camp in Poland by entrepreneur Elon Musk and US conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, organised as part of a series of events and talks by the European Jewish Association.
“Speaking as part of another panel, Sean O Fearghail, President of Parliament [sic], Ireland, claimed Ireland’s small community of about 2,100 individuals has experienced ‘very little’ antisemitism, and is ‘much beloved’ by the Irish people,”the article reads.

“He noted however the community is “concerned” over anti-Israel demonstrations and rising antisemitism, partly due to a “massive influx of immigrants” who bring with them some ‘unsavoury’ views, but also because it is coming from “not just the extreme right, but from the left also.”
Video footage of the remarks were not easily accessible. However, they can be found about 4-and-a-half hours into aFacebook Live steam, and show Ó Fearghaíl saying something rather different.
“It involves not just the extreme right, but the left also,” Ó Fearghaíl said of antisemitism in Ireland. “And it’s connected, not just to the crisis in Gaza, but it’s connected to a reaction across Ireland to a massive influx of immigrants into our country.
“I’m hugely proud that Ireland has opened its doors to people from all over the world, but particularly from Ukraine, just as countries all around the world opened their doors to Irish people when we were forced to emigrate.
“72 million people worldwide claim Irish ancestry. So, we are the last nation on Earth to be unwelcoming to the immigrant.
“But there are elements, unsavoury elements, elements that promote hate and dissention, and that’s what links what’s happening in Ireland to what you’re doing here.”
Paul Murphy would laterpost a replyto his own tweet saying that Ó Fearghaíll was “misquoted on the migrants, blaming the rise of anti-migrant sentiments, not the migrants themselves.
“But he’s accurately quoted in blaming the left for anti-semitism and calling for Hezbollah an ‘evil plague on humanity’ which ‘must be brought to an end’.

"Holly Cairns 
 Ireland has long advocated for the Palestinians - we can't let them down now","WHAT FURTHER EVIDENCE does the Irish Government need to convince it there is a genocide taking place in Gaza? The scale of the carnage in Gaza is unprecedented in recent history. In just over 100 days, almost100,000Palestinians have been killed, reported missing or wounded. More than 25,000 people have now been confirmed dead, 10,000 of whom are children.
To date, 85% of Gaza’s population have been displaced, misled into believing they were moving to so-called “safe areas”, which have, in reality, become killing fields.
Israeli missiles have targeted schools, universities, hospitals, UN facilities, refugee camps, places of worship and critical civilian infrastructure like sanitation, power supply and communication facilities. Israeli snipers have even shot medics while they attempted to treat the injured inside hospitals.
The barbarity with which Israel is waging this war is evident in its choice of weaponry. It is using 2,000-pound bombs, which have a lethal blast radius of 365 metres – equivalent to 58 soccer fields in size. These bombs are not being used sparingly. ANew York Times investigationfound they have been used on hundreds of occasions. How can any country claim it does not have genocidal intent when it is dropping bombs of that enormous size and lethality in densely populated residential areas, where 50% of the residents are children?
The overwhelming weight of independent evidence, from NGOs and bodies like the UN, is clear and unambiguous about the nature of this disaster. As far back as 10 November, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that“nowhere and no one is safe in Gaza”.Human Rights Watch has stated the Israeli government is using starvation as aweapon of warand is deliberately depriving civilians in Gaza of the “resources necessary for daily existence” – food, water and medical supplies.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said that80% of the hungriest people in the world are now in Gazaand more than one million people are starving from a man-made famine. Mr Guterres said the scale of the killing by Israel is “unprecedented” and that people are not just dying from bombs, but “from lack of food and clean water” and “hospitals without power and medicine”.
Advertisement
It should be noted that civilians are dying from starvation, dehydration and a lack of medical supplies while, just across the border in Egypt, hundreds of trucks stuffed with critical aid are denied entry into Gaza by Israel.
The collapse of Gaza’s healthcare system – caused by Israel bombing hospitals, murdering medics and refusing to allow the distribution of medical supplies – has accelerated the death toll and compounded the suffering. According toSave the Children, every day, more than 10 children in Gaza are losing one or both of their legs. These children endure operations like amputations without anaesthetic, often conducted by torchlight.
There can be no doubt about the intention of the Israeli government when it comes to this conflict. Senior Israeli government officials – including the Prime Minister, President and Minister of Defence – have repeatedly made statements of genocidal intent.
To be clear, no armed attack on a State’s territory – even a heinous atrocity like the attack by Hamas on Israel, and the taking of hostages, on October 7 – can ever justify, or provide a defence to, breaches of the Genocide Convention.
Countries that claim to care about human rights and adherence to international law, cannot and should not sit idly by while this disgusting massacre is being livestreamed in real-time. Unlike previous genocides, we cannot claim ignorance. The images of the horrors being perpetrated on Gaza are being beamed around the world every day by Palestinians who are desperately asking for the international community to intervene and end this massacre.
This is why, tomorrow, the Social Democrats will introduce a Dáil motion calling on the Irish Government to support South Africa’s case against Israel under the Genocide Convention in the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
Under Article 1 of the Genocide Convention– which Ireland ratified in 1976 – parties to the convention have an obligation to take measures to prevent genocide. Ireland has previously acted on this obligation, filing an intervention in support of a case taken by Ukraine against Russia under the Genocide Convention in 2022.
The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Micheál Martin, has freely used the word “genocide” in the pastto describe Russia’s attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine. This makes the Government’s reluctance to unequivocally support South Africa’s case in the ICJ all the more difficult to understand – and suggests a double standard is at play.
Read NextRelated ReadsGunfire and strikes shake Gaza as Biden and Netanyahu have first call in a monthGaza death toll nears 25,000 as Netanyahu rejects calls for Palestinian stateIsrael and Hamas reach deal for Gaza hostages to receive medicines in exchange for aid to civilians
The Tánaiste has indicated that the Government will awaita preliminary ruling by the ICJ, in relation to provisional measures sought by South Africa, before considering if Ireland should intervene in the case. This will then be followed by an indeterminate period of consultation and legal analysis before any action is taken.
How long more does the Irish Government intend to wait before it acts? What further evidence would it like to see? How many more deaths will suffice? While the Government adopts a ‘wait and see’ approach, an average of 250 people are being slaughtered every day in Gaza. The people of Gaza do not have the luxury of time.
Ireland has been a strong voice for the Palestinian people on the world stage, but words are not enough. They do not provide a defence to bombs, disease and famine.
At a time when most of the Western world remains silent about Israel’s slaughter, Ireland must not just find its voice – it needs to act. We must stand on the right side of history and support South Africa’s attempts to stop this genocide as quickly as possible.

EU foreign ministers press Israel on eventual two-state solution,"LAST UPDATE|22 Jan
EU FOREIGN MINISTERS have pressed Israel on an eventual two-state solution with the Palestinians after the war in Gaza at meetings with the top diplomats from the two sides and key Arab states in Brussels.
The 27 EU ministers met with Israel’s foreign minister Israel Katz before sitting down separately with the Palestinian Authority’s top diplomat, Riyad al-Maliki.
The foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia also held talks with the European ministers.
Meanwhile, the relatives hostages in Gaza, who were captured by Hamas on 7 October, have stormed an Israeli parliament committee hearing today.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has drawn condemnation from the United Nations and defied key backer the United States by rejecting calls for a Palestinian state.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell insisted the immediate “priority is to provide support to the people” facing a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.
“More death, more destruction, more hardship for the Gaza people, for the Palestinian people, will not help to defeat Hamas or the ideology,” he said. “It will not bring more security to Israel on the contrary.”
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ignored questions from journalists over a future two-state solution and said the country was focused on returning the hostages and ensuring its own security.
Borrell said the Israeli minister “could have made better use of his time” after he showed videos about a potential artificial port island off Gaza and a transport corridor to India to his European counterparts, adding it “didn’t have much to do with what we were discussing”.

Palestine’s Al-Maliki demanded the EU call for a ceasefire immediately and urged the bloc to consider sanctions against Netanyahu for “destroying the chances” of a two-state solution. “Every day that … we show hesitancy, people are being killed,” he said.
Borrell circulated what he called a “comprehensive approach” towards finding peace, involving the international community holding a conference that would come up with a plan to be put to both the Israelis and the Palestinians.
The paper said the international community should then eventually “set out the consequences they envisage to attach to engagement or non-engagement with the peace plan” by either side.
Protestors barged past security in the parliament building and entered an ongoing finance committee hearing, in one of the rooms of the Knesset building in Jerusalem.
The group were demanding that the Israeli government take more action to rescue the over 130 remaining hostages in Gaza.
A man, first to break through security and into the room, shouted at politicians while others piled through the doors.

The man said in Hebrew: “It can’t go on like this. It can’t go on like this. You won’t sit there while our children die over there.”
Fellow protesters held signs with the same message to the politicians.
While security struggled to hold the man away, one committee member told security to “leave him alone” and to let him speak.
Other protesters in the room chanted: “Release them now, now, now!”

The families of the hostages have yet to see their loved ones since the 7 October attacks, 107 days ago.
Over 100 hostages werereleasedduring asix-day ceasefireat theend of November, however negotiations to continue the ceasefire were dismantled afterIsrael pulled away from talks.
Hamas militants seized about 250 hostages during the first attack. Israeli officials say around 132 remain in Gaza.
Netanyahu has vowed “complete victory” over Hamas after the attacks that resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures and conducted by the AFP news agency.
Israel’s assault on Gaza after the October attack killed over 25,000 Palestinians, the vast majority women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
Gazans have sheltered today from intense bombing and shooting in the city of Khan Younis.
Witnesses reported deadly strikes and fierce fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas militants overnight in the southern city which has become the latest epicentre of the conflict.
The health ministry in Gaza reported today that more than 120 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours.

The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli forces were “besieging” their ambulance centre “and targeting anyone attempting to move in the area”.

Tánaiste calls Netanyahu's rejection of two-state solution 'unacceptable' ahead of EU meeting,"LAST UPDATE|22 Jan
TÁNAISTE MICHEÁL MARTIN has critised Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments rejecting a two-state solution with Palestine, and urged the Israeli leader “to lead” and back the policy.
Martin said that having separate Israeli and Palestinian states would be the “ultimate security guarantee” to citizens in both, and that the Israeli’s government’s stance does not help talks aimed at securing peace.
Netanyahu’s office said in a statement on Saturday that Israel “must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel”, adding that this was a requirement that “contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty”.
Martin took part in a summit of EU’s foreign ministers this morning to discuss the Israeli invasion of Gaza and Russia’s war on Ukraine.
The Tánaiste will meet with officials representing Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Palestine, and will later meet with the Israeli Foreign Minister.
Speaking to media this morning in Brussels, Martin said:
“Those remarks by Prime Minister Netanyahu are unacceptable and do not contribute in any way to the prospects of peace. I would say to Prime Minister Netanyahu he needs to lead, he needs to listen to the vast majority of the world who want a peace and who want a two-state solution.
“On the basis that a two-state solution is the ultimate security guarantee to Israel, and to Israeli citizens and to Palestinians in terms of their future prospects of living in harmonious coexistence.
“There is no other alternative on the table to a two-state solution that is sustainable, and that will make for a sustainable peace into the future.”
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell today insisted on an eventual two-state solution as he told Israel it couldn’t build peace “only by military means” ahead of talks with Israeli and Palestinian top diplomats.
Borrell repeated the condemnation from the United Nations of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “unacceptable” rejection of calls for a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza.
“What we want to do is to build a two-state solution. So let’s talk about it,” Borrell said.
He told Israel that “peace and stability cannot be built only by military means”.
“Which are the other solutions they have in mind? To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill off them?” Borrell said.

While speaking this morning, Martin said Ireland would seek to press ahead with the Irish government’s calls for a ceasefire and also for sanctions arising from Israeli violence against residents of the West Bank.
Martin said he is pushing for an “EU-wide policy” on sanctions against settlers in the West Bank.
“From Ireland’s perspective we will be, again, putting a lot of pressure on calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and also absolutely the unimpeded access for humanitarian aid in,” he said.
“Reports we are receiving in as late as last evening are dire in respect of what’s happening within Gaza, in terms of the humanitarian consequences of this war, ad there’s no excuse now for any tardiness or for any delays in respective getting vital aid into Gaza, and we’ll be making those points really strongly.”
The Fianna Fáil leader also called for the “unconditional release” of hostages held by Hamas.
The 27 EU ministers met first with Israel’s foreign minister Israel Katz before they were due to sit down separately with the Palestinian Authority’s top diplomat, Riyad al-Maliki.
Katz ignored questions from journalists over a future two-state solution and said Israel was focused now on returning the hostages and ensuring its own security.
The EU has struggled for a united stance on the conflict in Gaza as staunch backers of Israel such as Germany have rejected demands for an immediate ceasefire made by the likes of Spain and Ireland.
But there is overall backing in the bloc for a two-state solution.
United Nations agencies have warned of famine and disease as Gazans, 1.7 million of whom are displaced, struggle with shortages of water, medical care and other essentials during daily bombardment.
With fuel scarce, they have increasingly turned to donkey carts for transport.
“Anyone who used to own a car now uses a donkey. Even businessmen or officials try to collect money just to buy a donkey,” said Badr al-Akhras, a trader of the animals.
Diplomatic efforts have sought scaled-up aid deliveries for Gaza, and a truce, after a week-long cessation of hostilities in November saw Hamas release dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Yesterday, 260 humanitarian aid trucks were transferred to Gaza, according to COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs.
“Ireland is very very clear that there has to be sanctions. And there is agreement in terms of sanctions against Hamas, which is correct, but equally there needs to be agreement on sanctions against the West Bank and violent settlers and we’re very clear on that and we’ll be pushing very strongly today,” he added.

Irish Government will 'consider' joining genocide case against Israel after preliminary stage,"TÁNAISTE MICHEÁL MARTIN has defended the Government’s stance in relation to a case taken by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and said Ireland would consider joining the case once it had passed the preliminary stages.
South Africa has taken the case over Israel’s actions in Gaza, where 25,000 people have been killed since October last year, according to local health authorities.
Speaking to RTÉ’s This Week programme, Martin said:
“South Africa have taken a preliminary case to the court (ICJ), Israel have responded, no-one has actually joined that case yet, nor can anyone join it right now – not even Palestine.
“Because the court is going to make a provisional judgment on that to respond to what South Africa has sought, which is exactly what we have sought, the same thing: an immediate cessation of hostilities and war, unimpeded access of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
He said that Ireland would act the same way it did in relation to an ICJ case where Ukraine accused Russia of violating the Genocide Convention.
Martin said they examined the legal case for around 12 weeks before joining Ukraine’s case.
“And we will give this very serious consideration, of course,” he said of South Africa’s case.
“Because these are legal conventions, it will take years to resolve, meanwhile, we have to keep our focus on getting a ceasefire.”

Under pressure
The Government is under pressure to support the case, with opposition party the Social Democrats set to introduce a Dáil motion next week calling on the Irish Government to support South Africa’s case.
Party leader Holly Cairns said the country “cannot stand idly by while the daily slaughter of innocent civilians in Gaza continues”.
“Since Israel began its military operations three months ago, nearly 100,000 Palestinians have been killed, reported missing or wounded in Gaza. Almost 25,000 people have now been confirmed dead, two thirds of whom are women and children,” she said.
She said that Ireland under Article 1 of the Genocide Convention parties to the convention have an obligation to take measures to prevent genocide.
“The Tánaiste has indicated that the Government will await a ruling by the ICJ in relation to provisional measures before considering if Ireland should intervene in the case,” Cairns said.
Martin has also come under pressure from his own MEPs, with Barry Andrews and Billy Kelleherboth tellingTheJournalearlier this monththat Ireland should have joined the case.
In the interview today, Martin also said that Israel “has to be held to account” as Palestinian deaths in the Gaza enclave reached 25,000, according to local health authorities.
“Israel has to be held to account in terms of what it’s doing,” he said.
“I condemn the continued bombardment of Gaza. It is shocking. It’s horrifying. It’s not justified in any shape or form.”

Israel continues bombardment of Gaza with at least 165 people killed in 24 hours,"
FIGHTING IS RAGING across the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, whose health ministry reported a surging death toll, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said four of its members were killed by a strike in Syria that it blamed on Israel.
The Syria strike is the latest regional incident raising fears of wider conflagration.
It came even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Joe Biden discussed the post-war future of Gaza where the humanitarian situation remains dire.
Gaza’s health ministry reported at least 165 people killed over the previous 24 hours – by far the largest such toll it has issued in days, and more than double the previous day’s figure.
An AFP correspondent reported gunfire, air strikes and tank shelling into the morning, particularly in southern Gaza’s Khan Yunis city.
Israel is pressing its push southwards against Hamas militants, after the army in early January said the Hamas command structure in northern Gaza had been dismantled, leaving only isolated fighters.
But the armed wing of Hamas reported fierce combat with Israeli troops in north Gaza on Saturday.
The military said troops backed by air and naval support were striking militant infrastructure throughout the Gaza Strip, including the north.
Spy chief
Also on Saturday an Israeli strike on Damascus killed the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ spy chief for Syria and three other Guards members, Iranian media reported.
Israel has intensified attacks on targets in Syria, often against Iran-backed forces, since the Israel-Hamas war began on 7 October.

Hamas, like Lebanon’s Hezbollah, is an ally of Israel’s arch-foe Iran.
The unprecedented October attacks by Hamas resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in response. Its relentless bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 24,927 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
The United States provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid but has urged it to take more care to protect civilians, and the two sides have disagreed over Gaza’s future governance.
Biden said it was still possible Netanyahu could agree to some form of Palestinian state, after the two leaders spoke for the first time in nearly a month.
Netanyahu had said on Thursday that Israel “must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River”, which “contradicts the idea of (Palestinian) sovereignty”.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that Israel could not achieve “genuine security” without a “pathway to a Palestinian state” — a goal sought by Palestinians for decades.
The United Nations estimates the war has displaced 1.7 million people, about one million of whom are crowded into the Rafah area in Gaza’s far south, near Egypt.
UN agencies have warned better aid access – including through Israel’s Ashdod port — is needed urgently as famine and disease loom.
After Friday’s call, the White House said Israel would allow flour shipments for Palestinians through Ashdod.
Neither bread, nor water
Bread is a staple food for Palestinians but aid agencies said only 15 bakeries were operational across Gaza, the UN humanitarian agency OCHA reported.
The availability of water for drinking and domestic use “is shrinking every day”, OCHA added.

Nearly 20,000 babies have been born in conditions “beyond belief” in Gaza since the start of the Israeli offensive, the UN children’s agency UNICEF said.
Thousands of Gazan men may have been detained by Israeli forces during the war, often facing conditions that could amount to torture, the UN’s human rights representative in the Palestinian territories, Ajith Sunghay, said on Friday.
Israel’s military responded that individuals suspected of involvement in “terrorist activities” were being detained and questioned. It said they are treated in accordance with international law.
During the October attacks militants seized about 250 hostages, around 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza. At least 27 captives are believed to have been killed, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 360 people since October 7, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
The White House said Friday it was “seriously concerned” about reports a Palestinian teenager with US citizenship had been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank.
Deadly exchanges of fire have occurred regularly between Israeli forces and Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement, whose deputy leader Haim Qassem on Friday warned: “If Israel decides to expand its aggression, it will receive a real slap in the face”.
Israel and Hezbollah fought a war in 2006. Lebanon and Israel remain technically at war, with border disputes plaguing the relationship.
An American drone crashed north of Baghdad, a US defence official said Friday, after Iran-backed militants claimed they fired on an unmanned aircraft flying over Iraq.
The US also said its military carried out a sixth round of strikes against Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels, targeting missile launchers preparing for attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.
The Huthis, targeting what they deem Israeli-linked vessels, have professed defiance in the face of the strikes, also by Britain.
“We swear to God. We will fight you on land, sea, and air, and wherever we find you,” Naji Siraj, a Huthi fighter, said in the rebel-held capital Sanaa at a rally which appeared to be attended by tens of thousands.","12.15pm, 20 Jan 2024",,
"MSF says healthcare system in Gaza has 'virtually collapsed' as death toll hits more than 23,700","LAST UPDATE|12 Jan

MÉDECINS SANS FRONTIÉRES (MSF) has said the healthcare system in Gaza has “virtually collapsed”, with “constant” evacuation orders and attacks on health facilities repeatedly forcing health organisations to evacuate hospitals and leave patients behind.
Telecommunication services were cut across besieged Gaza today, after Israeli strikes killed dozens in southern cities where hundreds of thousands are struggling to survive hunger and cold on the 98th day of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.
In Gaza, an AFP journalist reported strikes and shelling hitting areas between the territory’s southern cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah, which is crowded with people who have fled from the north.
Overnight, the bombardment killed at least 59 people and wounded dozens more across the besieged territory, the health ministry in Gaza said.
The Israeli military said it had killed seven “terrorists” in a strike in Khan Yunis and a further 20 in the Maghazi area to the north.
AFP footage showed black smoke billowing over Rafah and Khan Yunis.
“Does anyone care about us? Why is everyone silent?” asked one mourner at a hospital where a group of Palestinians had gathered beside white body bags of the latest casualties.
Elsewhere in Rafah, resident Fayad Abu Rjeila surveyed the wreckage of a building after an Israeli strike he said had killed civilians in their homes.
“They had nothing to do with anything. People who just wanted to live,” he told AFP.
“Why did they target them?”
Israel’s military said its ground forces and air strikes had destroyed more than 700 rocket launchers in Gaza since the ongoing conflict began on 7 October.
In a statement today, MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said the Israeli forces’ assault on Gaza “has drastically diminished the options for people to find medical care”.

Three months into the conflict, the NGO said the amount of safe space for organisations to provide healthcare to people is now virtually non-existent.

“We’re gradually being cornered in a very restrictive perimeter in southern Gaza, in Rafah, with dwindling options to offer critical medical assistance, while the needs are desperately growing,” Thomas Lauvin, MSF project coordinator in Gaza, said.
“As the assault on Gaza has progressed, we have had to evacuate several health facilities in the north of Gaza, then in the Middle Area. Today we are limited to mainly working in the south, because we cannot work elsewhere.
The NGO said that medical facilities and their surrounding areas have repeatedly been hit by Israeli Forces and been subjected to evacuation orders in different parts of Gaza, particularly in the north, making access to, and the provision of, healthcare too dangerous.
It said that several hospitals where MSF was working have been through this situation, including the Indonesian hospital in north Gaza and Al-Shifa hospital.
Al Awda hospital, MSF’s partner hospital since 2018, was hit in November. Three doctors were killed, two of them were among MSF staff.
“Now, this pattern is repeating itself in the south, which hosts five times the number of people it did before the war, and fewer places to provide people healthcare.”
MSF said the lack of hospital capacity is depriving patients of adequate treatment and proper hygienic conditions, which is resulting in increasing numbers of infected wounds and medical procedures being carried out in “extreme conditions”.
“Beyond critical injuries, many women who underwent c-section are discharged just six hours after delivery to make space for other pregnant women, while some are simply turned away and give birth in tents.”
MSF added that it remains committed to providing medical care in Gaza and called for the protection of hospitals, medical staff and patients.
Today, all internet and telecommunications services in Gaza were cut as a result of the Israeli bombardment of the Palestinian territory, the main operator Paltel said.
“Gaza is blacked out again,” it said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 23,708 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.
The ministry added that it has registered 60,005 wounded, while scores remain trapped under the rubble
Vowing to eliminate Hamas, Israel has carried out a relentless bombardment, alongside a ground invasion, since Hamas fighters attacked Israel on 7 October.
The unprecedented attack by the Islamist group resulted in the death of about 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
The charity Oxfam International said yesterday that the daily death toll in Gaza was higher than in any other major conflict this century, with an average of 250 people killed daily.
Oxfam’s Sally Abi Khalil said it is “unimaginable” that the international community stands by “while continuously blocking calls for a ceasefire”.
In northern Gaza, the World Health Organization said it had reached Gaza’s largest hospital on Thursday, delivering desperately needed fuel and medical supplies.
“The team reported that Al-Shifa, previously Gaza’s premier hospital, has (partially) re-established services,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X.
Andrea De Domenico, head of the UN aid agency OCHA’s office in the occupied Palestinian territories, told AFP on Friday Israel was constantly blocking humanitarian aid convoys into northern Gaza.
“But in particular, they have been very systematic to not allowing us to support hospitals, which is something that is reaching a point of a level of inhumanity that for me is beyond comprehension,” he said.
Amid fears of Israel’s war against Hamas spreading, American and British forces launched early morning raids against Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthis, after the rebels targeted shipping in the Red Sea they said was linked to Israel.
Violence involving Tehran-aligned groups in Yemen, as well as in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, has surged since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.

Gunfire and strikes shake Gaza as Biden and Netanyahu have first call in a month,"LAST UPDATE|19 Jan
GUNFIRE AND AIRSTRIKES have shaken Gaza’s city of Khan Yunis today, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden discussed the conflict for the first time in a month.
The Palestinian Red Crescent, a humanitarian aid organisation, reported “intense shelling” in the vicinity of its Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Yunis last night – since Israel’s military campaign in response to the 7 October Hamas attacks began, eight ambulance workers from the organisation have died.
The official WAFA Palestinian news agency this morning reported that a number of civilians were “tragically killed” in a barrage of artillery strikes targeting Khan Yunis last night.
“Local sources reported that at least four civilians were killed in the Israeli shelling which targeted a house belonging to the Kazemi family in the western neighborhood of Khan Yunis,” the agency said.

Ahmed El-Madhoun from the Mena rights organisation tweeted overnight saying, “It’s 6am and clashes around Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis have not stopped for hours. Intense bombardment! We cannot determine its location!”.
There have also been reports of strikes in Rafah and Gaza city.
An orange fireball flashed above rooftops and an AFP journalist saw plumes of dark smoke towering above the city in nearby Rafah, the Strip’s southernmost city.
The United Nations has called repeatedly for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as it has said that 85% of the region’s population have been displaced and people are living in “inhumane conditions, where diseases are spreading, including among children.”
Gaza’s health ministry reported today that at least 24,762 people have been killed in Gaza since 7 October.
The toll includes 142 fatalities over the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said.

Currently only six of its 22 health centres in Gaza are operational. Yesterday it started giving out vaccinations again, following a donation of eight different vaccine types from the charity UNICEF.
The World Health Organisation said overnight that it counted 24 cases of Hepatitis A and “thousands” of jaundice cases, which it linked to the spread of the viral liver infection.
It pointed to the almost complete lack of drinking water and the absence of clean toilets as factors that will see Hepatitis A spread further.
On Wednesday, a shipment of medicine for dozens of hostages held by Hamas has arrived in Gaza after France and Qatar mediated the first agreement between Israel and the militant group since a week-long ceasefire in November.
Qatar’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Majed al-Ansari said on Wednesday night that the shipment had crossed into Gaza, without saying whether the medicine had been distributed.
A senior Hamas official said that for every box provided for the hostages, 1,000 boxes of medicine would be sent in for Palestinians. The deal also includes humanitarian aid for residents of the besieged coastal enclave.
ActionAid today claimed in a statement that “confusing and arbitrary rules” about the type of aid permitted to enter Gaza is resulting in thousands of essential items being stopped at border crossings and prevented from reaching those who desperately need it.
Among the items rejected during inspections are oxygen cylinders and anaesthetics for hospitals, according to ActionAid Ireland CEO Karol Balfe.
Stone fruit is being refused entry under the explanation that the stones could be used as bullets or to plant trees, while tent poles – which help to provide shelter for Gaza’s 1.9 million displaced people – are also being turned away, ActionAid said it has heard.
Biden and Netanyahu spoke about Gaza today, in their first conversation for nearly a month amid reports of tensions between the leaders.
The call came a day after Netanyahu said he had told Washington that he opposes allowing Palestinian statehood after the conflict with Hamas, putting him at odds with long-standing US policy.
The pair last spoke on 23 December and the silence since has led to repeated questions about a rift between Biden and Netanyahu over Israel’s offensive in Gaza and future plans.

Israel will let shipments of flour for Palestinians through the Israeli port of Ashdod, north of Gaza, the White House said after the call.
“The president welcomed the decision from the Government of Israel to permit the shipment of flour for the Palestinian people directly through Ashdod port,” the White House said in a readout of their call.
US teams would “separately work on options for more direct maritime delivery of assistance into Gaza,” it added.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken renewed his call for a “pathway to a Palestinian state”.
However, Netanyahu once again this week voiced his opposition to the two-state solution which the US, its greatest ally, endorses.
“Israel must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River,” he said.
“This is a necessary condition, which contradicts the idea of (Palestinian) sovereignty,” the Israeli Prime Minister added.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas has said that without an independent state for Palestine, there will be no “security and stability in the region”.
In Ireland, the Social Democrats said today it will issue a Dáil motion next Wedneday, calling on the Irish Government to support South Africa’s case agaisnt Israel under the Genocide Convention in the International Court of Justice.

"Gaza death toll nears 25,000 as Netanyahu rejects calls for Palestinian state","LAST UPDATE|18 Jan
ISRAELI GROUND TROOPS have killed dozens of militants in “close-quarters combat” today, the army said, as it intensified operations in Khan Yunis, south Gaza’s biggest city.
The army said the soldiers, part of the Givati Brigade unit that had been based in Gaza before Israel’s 2005 withdrawal, “eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and with the assistance of tank fire and air support”.
Soldiers raided an outpost of Hamas’s Khan Yunis brigade and the offices of its commanders, seizing weapons, it added.
The army also said its Givati Brigade was “fighting in the southernmost area that ground troops have operated in so far”.
Fighting has ravaged Gaza since Hamas’s unprecedented 7 October attacks on Israel that resulted in the death of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
At least 24,620 Palestinians, around 70% of them women, children and adolescents, have been killed in the fighting, according to the Gaza health ministry.
In a nationally televised news conference today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly said that Israel would not halt its offencive until it reaches its goals of destroying Hamas and bringing home all remaining hostages.
He rejected claims by a growing number of Israeli critics that those goals are not achievable, vowing to press ahead for many months.
“We will not settle for anything short of an absolute victory,” Netanyahu said.
At the same conference, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister said it is ready to establish full relations with Israel as part of a larger political agreement. “But that can only happen through peace for the Palestinians, through a Palestinian state,” he said.
Netanyahu, however, repeated his longstanding opposition to a two-state solution. He said a Palestinian state would become a launching pad for attacks on Israel.
He said Israel “must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River”, adding: “That collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can we do?”
“This truth I tell to our American friends, and I put the brakes on the attempt to coerce us to a reality that would endanger the state of Israel,” he said.
The comments prompted an immediate rebuke from the White House, with a spokesperson saying that President Joe Biden would “not stop working” towards a two-state solution.

Live footage from AFPTV showed smoke rising over central-southern Gaza in the afternoon.
The Hamas government reported dozens of strikes, including on Khan Yunis and refugee camps in central Gaza.
Gaza’s health ministry said 93 people had been killed overnight, including 16 in a strike on a house in the southern city of Rafah, where many people have fled.
Those killed in the Rafah strike included women and children, and 20 people were injured, the ministry said.
Militants seized about 250 hostages during the 7 October attacks, around 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.
At least 27 hostages are believed to have been killed, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Palestinian and Israeli officials today confirmed a shipment of aid, including medicine for hostages, had entered Gaza after French and Qatari mediation.
Qatar last night said the shipment, which also comprises humanitarian aid for Gazan civilians, had reached the territory under an agreement announced on Tuesday.

There was, however, no word on whether medicines had been distributed to dozens of hostages with chronic illnesses who are being held by Hamas.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it did not play any role in implementing the deal but welcomed it as “a much-needed moment of relief”.
The European Parliament today called for a “permanent ceasefire” in Gaza – but on condition that all Israeli hostages are released immediately and Hamas dismantled.
The parliament called in an amended resolution “for a permanent ceasefire and to restart efforts towards a political solution provided that all hostages are immediately and unconditionally released and the terrorist organisation Hamas is dismantled”.
The non-binding resolution was backed by 312 lawmakers, with 131 voting against and 72 abstaining.
Irish Green MEPs Grace O’Sullivan and Ciarán Cuffe voted against the resolution.
They said the amendments to the text rendered the ceasefire call “practically meaningless”.

“In saying that the Parliament only supports a ceasefire on the condition that Hamas is eliminated essentially hands the far-right Israeli government a blank cheque to continue the bombardment of Gaza for as long as they want,” O’Sullivan said.
Fianna Fáil MEPs Barry Andrews and Billy Kelleher said they could not support the resoltuion as it “was not balanced enough to earn our support”.
“The inclusion of conditionality clauses with respect to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, supported by right wing MEPs, was a red line issue for us,” they said.
Independents 4 Change MEPs Mick Wallace and Clare Daly said the amended resolution “is the opposite of what is needed”.
“While it pretends to regret the humanitarian situation in Gaza, MEPs voted down amendment after amendment calling for meaningful steps to address it,” they said.

In the occupied West Bank, where violence has soared alongside the conflict in Gaza, an Israeli raid has continued into a second day around Tulkarem, an official said.
Palestinian health officials reported a sixth person had been killed in the operation.
The man shot dead today in Nur Shams refugee camp, on the edge of Tulkarem, was a civilian not involved in fighting between Israeli forces and militants, local official Remi Elyan told AFP.
Israel’s military said troops returned fire while they were working to “uncover roads where explosive devices were planted”.
Israeli forces killed 10 people in the West Bank yesterday, the ministry and the army said.
Five were killed inside Tulkarem refugee camp, according to the ministry, while Israel’s military confirmed an air strike that killed “a number of terrorists” during a raid there.

A DEAL TO allow the delivery of medicines to hostages in Gaza and aid into the territory has been agreed following mediation by Doha and Paris, Qatar and Israel announced today.
In a statement to the official Qatar News Agency, the foreign ministry announced the deal “where medicine along with other humanitarian aid is to be delivered to civilians in Gaza… in exchange for delivering medication needed for Israeli captives in Gaza”.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed the deal and said: “The medicines will be forwarded by Qatari representatives in the Gaza Strip to their final destination.”
Qatar, which hosts Hamas’s political office, has led negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian militant group, having mediated a week-long break in the war in Gaza in November which included the release of scores of Israeli and foreign hostages.
Israel pummelled southern Gaza today, killing dozens, even as authorities announced the winding down of the intense phase of the conflict that has inflamed tensions across the Middle East.
Netanyahu has come under mounting international pressure to end its offensive in Gaza launched in response to Hamas’s unprecedented 7 October attacks.
But fears are mounting the conflict could be widening, with Iran and its proxies stepping up attacks across the region in solidarity with Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules the Palestinian territory.
A wave of Israeli strikes killed at least 78 people in the Gaza Strip overnight, Hamas’s press office said. An AFP correspondent said the southern city of Khan Yunis was hit hard.
A barrage of 50 rockets was fired later toward Netivot in southern Israel, without causing any casualties, the army said. The attack was claimed by Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades.
AFPTV live footage showed trails of smoke and explosions ring out as Israeli air defences intercepted rockets near Gaza.
Fighting has ravaged Gaza since 7 October, when Hamas militants carried out an unparallelled attack on Israel that resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Militants also dragged about 250 hostages back to Gaza, 132 of whom Israel says are still in the Palestinian territory, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.

At least 24,285 Palestinians, about 70% of them women, children and adolescents, have been killed in Gaza in Israeli bombardments and ground operations since 7 October, according to the Hamas government.
Khan Yunis has been the focus of Israeli military operations since the army said on 6 January that it had dismantled Hamas’s military structures in the north and was shifting its focus to the south.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had said yesterday that intense operations would soon be winding down in the territory’s south.
“In southern Gaza we will reach this achievement and it will end soon, and in both places, the moment will come when we will move to the next phase,” he said, without giving a time frame.
The army announced today the death of two more soldiers in Gaza, bringing the total number killed since its ground invasion began to 190.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres yesterday reiterated calls to stop the fighting.
“We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to ensure sufficient aid gets to where it is needed, to facilitate the release of the hostages, to tamp down the flames of wider war – because the longer the conflict in Gaza continues, the greater the risk of escalation and miscalculation,” he said.
Israeli officials have repeatedly warned the fighting will go on for months.
Violence involving regional allies of Iran-backed Hamas – considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union – has surged since the conflict began.
Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who say they act in solidarity with Gaza, claimed a missile strike on a US-owned cargo ship yesterday, just days after the United States and Britain bombed scores of targets inside the country in response to repeated attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.
In another such attack, a missile struck a Greek-owned cargo ship in the Red Sea off Yemen, maritime risk management company Ambrey said today.
The US military said it had seized Iranian-made missile parts that were en route to the Huthis on a boat in the Arabian Sea.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it carried out an overnight missile attack that destroyed “the Zionist regime’s” (Israel) spy headquarters in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.

The IRGC said it also struck a “gathering of anti-Iranian terrorist groups” in the Iraqi Kurdistan capital Arbil and hit a number of Islamic State group sites in Syria.
Iraq condemned the strikes as an “attack on its sovereignty”.
It dismissed Iran’s claim it had hit an Israeli intelligence base, saying it struck a businessman’s house and he was among four people killed.
Iran defended the strikes, saying they were a “targeted operation” and “just punishment” against those who breach its security.
Today, the Israeli army said it conducted air and artillery strikes on Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed Shiite movement across the border in Lebanon.
The UN says the Israel-Hamas conflict has displaced roughly 85% of Gaza’s 2.4 million people, many of whom have been forced to crowd into shelters and struggle to get food, water, fuel and medical care.
As temperatures plunge, families living in makeshift tents in the southern city of Rafah have resorted to burning plastic to ward off the chill, despite the noxious fumes.
The Israeli public, meanwhile, has kept up pressure on the government to secure the return of the hostages seized by Hamas, with the militant group yesterday announcing the deaths of two more captives.
The Al-Qassam Brigades released a video showing a woman hostage, speaking under duress, revealing that two men she was held with had been killed in captivity. It blamed “the Zionist army’s bombing” for their deaths.
Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari rejected the cause of death as a “lie”, but added: “We know that we hit targets near the location where they were held”, saying an investigation was under way.

"Gaza death toll nears 25,000 as Netanyahu rejects calls for Palestinian state","LAST UPDATE|18 Jan
ISRAELI GROUND TROOPS have killed dozens of militants in “close-quarters combat” today, the army said, as it intensified operations in Khan Yunis, south Gaza’s biggest city.
The army said the soldiers, part of the Givati Brigade unit that had been based in Gaza before Israel’s 2005 withdrawal, “eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and with the assistance of tank fire and air support”.
Soldiers raided an outpost of Hamas’s Khan Yunis brigade and the offices of its commanders, seizing weapons, it added.
The army also said its Givati Brigade was “fighting in the southernmost area that ground troops have operated in so far”.
Fighting has ravaged Gaza since Hamas’s unprecedented 7 October attacks on Israel that resulted in the death of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
At least 24,620 Palestinians, around 70% of them women, children and adolescents, have been killed in the fighting, according to the Gaza health ministry.
In a nationally televised news conference today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly said that Israel would not halt its offencive until it reaches its goals of destroying Hamas and bringing home all remaining hostages.
He rejected claims by a growing number of Israeli critics that those goals are not achievable, vowing to press ahead for many months.
“We will not settle for anything short of an absolute victory,” Netanyahu said.
At the same conference, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister said it is ready to establish full relations with Israel as part of a larger political agreement. “But that can only happen through peace for the Palestinians, through a Palestinian state,” he said.
Netanyahu, however, repeated his longstanding opposition to a two-state solution. He said a Palestinian state would become a launching pad for attacks on Israel.
He said Israel “must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River”, adding: “That collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can we do?”
“This truth I tell to our American friends, and I put the brakes on the attempt to coerce us to a reality that would endanger the state of Israel,” he said.
The comments prompted an immediate rebuke from the White House, with a spokesperson saying that President Joe Biden would “not stop working” towards a two-state solution.

Live footage from AFPTV showed smoke rising over central-southern Gaza in the afternoon.
The Hamas government reported dozens of strikes, including on Khan Yunis and refugee camps in central Gaza.
Gaza’s health ministry said 93 people had been killed overnight, including 16 in a strike on a house in the southern city of Rafah, where many people have fled.
Those killed in the Rafah strike included women and children, and 20 people were injured, the ministry said.
Militants seized about 250 hostages during the 7 October attacks, around 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.
At least 27 hostages are believed to have been killed, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Palestinian and Israeli officials today confirmed a shipment of aid, including medicine for hostages, had entered Gaza after French and Qatari mediation.
Qatar last night said the shipment, which also comprises humanitarian aid for Gazan civilians, had reached the territory under an agreement announced on Tuesday.

There was, however, no word on whether medicines had been distributed to dozens of hostages with chronic illnesses who are being held by Hamas.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it did not play any role in implementing the deal but welcomed it as “a much-needed moment of relief”.
The European Parliament today called for a “permanent ceasefire” in Gaza – but on condition that all Israeli hostages are released immediately and Hamas dismantled.
The parliament called in an amended resolution “for a permanent ceasefire and to restart efforts towards a political solution provided that all hostages are immediately and unconditionally released and the terrorist organisation Hamas is dismantled”.
The non-binding resolution was backed by 312 lawmakers, with 131 voting against and 72 abstaining.
Irish Green MEPs Grace O’Sullivan and Ciarán Cuffe voted against the resolution.
They said the amendments to the text rendered the ceasefire call “practically meaningless”.

“In saying that the Parliament only supports a ceasefire on the condition that Hamas is eliminated essentially hands the far-right Israeli government a blank cheque to continue the bombardment of Gaza for as long as they want,” O’Sullivan said.
Fianna Fáil MEPs Barry Andrews and Billy Kelleher said they could not support the resoltuion as it “was not balanced enough to earn our support”.
“The inclusion of conditionality clauses with respect to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, supported by right wing MEPs, was a red line issue for us,” they said.
Independents 4 Change MEPs Mick Wallace and Clare Daly said the amended resolution “is the opposite of what is needed”.
“While it pretends to regret the humanitarian situation in Gaza, MEPs voted down amendment after amendment calling for meaningful steps to address it,” they said.

In the occupied West Bank, where violence has soared alongside the conflict in Gaza, an Israeli raid has continued into a second day around Tulkarem, an official said.
Palestinian health officials reported a sixth person had been killed in the operation.
The man shot dead today in Nur Shams refugee camp, on the edge of Tulkarem, was a civilian not involved in fighting between Israeli forces and militants, local official Remi Elyan told AFP.
Israel’s military said troops returned fire while they were working to “uncover roads where explosive devices were planted”.
Israeli forces killed 10 people in the West Bank yesterday, the ministry and the army said.
Five were killed inside Tulkarem refugee camp, according to the ministry, while Israel’s military confirmed an air strike that killed “a number of terrorists” during a raid there.

"'Intensive' phase of conflict in south Gaza 'will end soon', Israeli defence minister says","LAST UPDATE|15 Jan
ISRAEL HAS SAID the “intensive” phase of its assault on Hamas in devastated southern Gaza would end “soon” as the UN chief pleaded for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”.
Hamas announcedthe death of two of the Israeli captivesit abducted during its October attack that triggered the conflict, in a video Israel condemned as a “brutal use of innocent hostages”.
Fighting has ravaged the Gaza Strip since 7 October, when Hamas militants carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel that resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel began a relentless military campaign that has killed at least 24,100 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
The army had stepped up operations and bombardments in the southern cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah in recent weeks after saying Hamas’s military structures in the north had been dismantled.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told a news conference today that an “intense manoeuvring stage” due to last around three months “will end soon” in southern Gaza.
He said the stage was already being reached in northern Gaza, with Israel’s army confirming one of its four divisions in the territory completed its withdrawal today.
The cabinet approved an amended 2024 budget including an additional 55 billion shekels (€13.3 billion) to meet the cost of the conflict, a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said fighting would still continue for months.

The UN says more than three months of conflict have displaced roughly 85% of Gaza’s population, crowded into shelters and struggling to get food, water, fuel and medical care.
Israel is facing heavy international pressure over Gaza’s humanitarian crisis and growing number of civilian casualties, with the territory’s health ministry reporting 60 deaths in overnight bombardment.
Deadly violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, exchanges of fire over Israel’s border with Lebanon, and strikes by US forces and Iran-backed Yemeni rebels in the Red Sea have raised fears of an escalation beyond the Gaza Strip.

UN chief Antonio Guterres today reiterated calls for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, “to ensure sufficient aid gets to where it is needed. To facilitate the release of the hostages. To tamp down the flames of wider war”.
AFPTV footage has shown smoke billowing over Khan Yunis, southern Gaza’s main city, as explosions could be heard from nearby Rafah, on the territory’s southern border with Egypt.
As temperatures plunge, families living in makeshift tents in Rafah have resorted to burning plastic to ward off the chill, despite the noxious fumes.
Echoing earlier warnings of a fast-approaching famine, UN agencies earlier called on Israel to allow access to its Ashdod port, north of Gaza, for critical aid deliveries.
Violence involving regional allies of Iran-backed Hamas – considered a “terrorist” group by the United States and the European Union – has surged since the conflict began.
Attacks by Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who say they act in solidarity with Gaza, have disrupted shipping in the vital Red Sea maritime trade route, triggering strikes on scores of rebel targets last Friday by US and British forces.
The Houthisclaimed a missile attackon a US-owned cargo ship off Yemen today, a day after firing a cruise missile at an American destroyer before it was shot down.
Since October, violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where three Palestinians were killed Monday in separate clashes with the Israeli army, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The Israeli army said its troops had opened fire and killed one person in Dura, near Hebron, after a crowd of around 100 “hurled Molotov cocktails and blocks” at them.
In central Israel, which has been largely spared the current violence, a suspected car ramming attack today killed one woman and injured 17 other people, medics said, and police arrested two Palestinian suspects.
Discussions have opened about the future reorganisation of the Palestinian territories after the conflict.
Gallant today said a Palestinian “civilian alternative” will govern post-conflict Gaza where Israeli forces would enjoy “freedom of operation” and with Hamas unable to “rule or function as a military force”.
The future Gaza government must grow out of the Gaza Strip,” Gallant said at a press conference.

Medicines for hostages and other aid arrives in Gaza as Israel continues strikes,"LAST UPDATE|17 Jan
MEDICINES FOR HOSTAGES in Gaza and humanitarian aid for civilians entered the war-torn Palestinian territory this evening under a deal mediated by Doha and Paris, Qatar announced.
“Over the past few hours, medicine and aid entered the Gaza Strip, in implementation of the agreement announced yesterday for the benefit of civilians in the Strip, including hostages,” Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
Under the agreement thrashed out on Tuesday, medicines along with humanitarian aid are to be supplied to civilians in Gaza in exchange for delivering drugs needed by hostages held there.
Forty-five hostages are expected to receive medication according to the agreement between Israel and Hamas.
Earlier, two Qatari planes carrying medicines arrived in the Egyptian city of El-Arish, near the Rafah border crossing, Qatar’s foreign ministry said.
A senior member of Hamas’ political bureau revealed new conditions for the delivery of medicines to hostages.
“For every box of medicine that goes in for them, 1,000 boxes will go in for residents of Gaza,” he said on X, formerly Twitter.
Israel to strike Gaza’s south, where the medicines and other aid was expected to be delivered for the hostages.
Cogat, an Israeli defence body in charge of Palestinian civilian affairs, said the trucks carrying the shipment will be inspected by Israeli authorities before entering Gaza.
On Monday, the World Health Organization said that “without the ability to produce or import food, the entire population of Gaza relies on aid to survive”.
“But humanitarian aid alone cannot meet the essential needs of the Gaza people,” the WHO said in its statement.
It said the the United Nations, international aid agencies and non-governmental organisations have so far managed to deliver “limited humanitarian assistance” in Gaza.
They added that “the quantities fall far short of what is needed to prevent a deadly combination of hunger, malnutrition, and disease”.
“The shortage of food, clean water, and medical assistance is particularly severe in the northern areas,” it said.
Meanwhile, air strikes and artillery fire targeted Khan Yunis throughout the night, said an AFP correspondent in the southern Gaza Strip’s biggest city.
“It was the most difficult and intense night in Khan Yunis since the start of the war,” said Gaza’s Hamas government.

A surgeon for Médecins Sans Frontiéres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis said Israeli forces heavily bombed the area close to the hospital last night and claimed there was no prior evacuation order.
During a visit to the hospital yesterday, MSF head of mission for Palestine Leo Cans said that Nasser, now Gaza’s largest functioning health facility, was operating at 300% capacity, adding “the situation is catastrophic. There are way too many patients for the staff to handle”.
“The fighting is very close to us. We hear a lot of bombing around, a lot of shooting around,” Cans said during his visit.
Fighting has ravaged Gaza since Hamas’s unprecedented 7 October attacks on Israel that resulted in the death of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
At least 24,448 Palestinians, about 70% of them women, young children and adolescents, have been killed in Israeli bombardments and ground assaults, according to the Gaza health ministry’s latest figures.

Israel’s army announced the death of one soldier today, bringing to 193 the total number killed in Gaza since ground operations began in late October.
Hamas and other militants seized about 250 hostages during the 7 October attacks, and around 132 remain in Gaza, including at least 27 believed to have been killed.
The United Nations says the conflict has displaced roughly 85% of Gaza’s 2.4 million people, many of whom have been forced to crowd into shelters and struggle to get food, water, fuel and medical care.
Violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since 7 October to a level not seen since the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, between 2000 and 2005.
Israeli army raids and attacks by settlers have killed around 365 people in the territory, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
The ministry said five people were killed inside Tulkarem refugee camp, with the Israeli military confirming an air strike that killed “a number of terrorists”.
Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas’s Fatah party, said five of its fighters died in a strike east of the city of Nablus.
The Israeli army said it killed a Palestinian militant to avert an “imminent terrorist attack” he had been planning.
Fears are also mounting that the Israel-Hamas conflict will trigger an all-out conflict across the Middle East, with growing violence involving allies of the Iran-backed Hamas.
The US military said it carried out fresh strikes in Yemen yesterday after the country’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels claimed another missile attack on a cargo ship in the Red Sea.
It came just days after the United States and Britain bombed scores of targets inside Houthi-controlled Yemen in response to attacks by the rebels, who say they are targeting Israeli-linked shipping in solidarity with Gaza.

The Explainer: Why did the US and the UK start bombing Yemen - and who are the Houthis?,"YEMEN IS A country wracked by years of civil war.
The death toll is now north of 155,000. Famine has consistently loomed, and more than 23 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.
But this war is often far from the focus of the media – until recent weeks, at least.
The Houthis, a rebel faction in Yemen who seized control of swathes of the country, have now launched attacks on international shipping vessels in the Rea Sea.
It’s in response to Israel’s attacks on Gaza, and the disruption to trade has caught the attention of the West, with the US and UK launching missile strikes on the rebels.

'We're continuing as if it's business as usual': Dáil suspended briefly after TDs push for debate on Gaza,"THE DÁIL WAS suspended briefly today – the first day of the new Dáil term – when People Before Profit TDs called on the government to allow a Dáil debate this week on the situation in Gaza.
The TDs said there should also be a debate on the government’s refusal to support South Africa’s action against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
On his feet in the chamber, TD Richard Boyd Barrett said:
Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl told the TD to resume his seat, telling him to “stop making a charade of the place”.
People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy said “it makes a charade of the place not to discuss a genocide, to continue as if we have business as usual when we have 250 Palestinians being killed every single day and you won’t even have a debate about it”.
“We need to have a debate this week,” he told Minister Heather Humphreys, who was standing in for Leaders’ Questions today.

TD Mick Barry said 10,000 have been killed since the Dáil last had a debate on the conflict.
Ó Fearghaíl suspended the House for five minutes after the TDs would not resume their seats.
When the Dáil resumed, Ó Fearghaíl said there wasn’t a single member in the Dáil who wasn’t “sickened by what they see happening in Gaza and what we saw happen in Israel on October 7th”.
“We’re shocked and appalled by all of it, but I don’t know what is being achieved by shouting in here and jumping up and down, or by a debate,” he said.
Humphreys said there are other opportunities where the issue could be debated.
“You don’t have to stand up there and just create a big fuss so that you’ll get attention and you run it off on social media and you have a big song and dance.
“I know what you do all the time. This is all about yourselves,” said the minister.

The event is enormously symbolic, said Murphy.
“We think this year that should not happen. The US is the number one supporter of what is happening in Palestine right now. Without US support, it could not be happening,” he said, stating that it “crucial” that the government makes the right call.
“No politician should meet with Joe Biden or any members of the US administration for St Patrick’s Day “as long as this genocide is continuing, as long as the US is providing huge amounts of military and political support”.

He said Ireland has to send a signal to show that the vast majority of the people in the country oppose the actions of Israel.
The boycott of the visit and the handing over of the shamrock would “have an impact symbolically in the US and around the world,” added Murphy.

The Sinn Féin leader toldThe Journalin Decemberthat she would not be in favour of boycotting the St Patrick’s Day visit to the White House over US support for Israel’s offensive in Gaza.
When asked if the situation carries on into the new year, and the US continues its support for Israel’s bombardment of Palestine, would she be supportive of calls to boycott the traditional St Patrick’s Day visit to Washington DC, she said:
“I think you need to be very careful about any idea of boycotting, the Irish relationship with the United States is a very long standing one, a very valuable one, on many, many dimensions.
“I think we need to be clear that that relationship for us is valuable, not least in terms of the evolution of our own peace process. But I certainly accept, and I have no doubt that the American system, if you listen to President Biden recently, he has acknowledged himself that Israel has lost the world.
“They have lost world opinion, for the simple reason that that no reasoned person, irrespective of the political spectrum they’re on, could witness that. Just stop, this has to stop.

“So I don’t think anybody should imagine that anybody in the American system is in any way confused about the Sinn Féin stance as regards Palestine, or indeed the Irish stance, the Irish public opinion on Palestine. And it’s interesting, if you look stateside, it’s different now. American public opinion is in a different place than it would have been saying a decade ago on this on this question,” said the Dublin Central TD.

McDonald said she spoke to the US ambassador to Ireland “quite recently” and other US officials where “the issue of Palestine did come up”.
“They know full well our analysis. I’m not shy about sharing it with them… America is very much on the right side of things in terms of the Irish peace process. I would like to see the United States very much on the right side of building peace in the Middle East,” she said.
Murphy said he hopes that Sinn Féin changes its position on the matter.
The People Before TD said the party changed its position on expelling the Israeli ambassador, stating that if enough pressure comes the grassroots, he would be hopeful that Sinn Féin would shift its position.
“That in turn would add pressure onto the government to change their position,” he concluded.

Israel and Hamas reach deal for Gaza hostages to receive medicines in exchange for aid to civilians,"LAST UPDATE|16 Jan

A DEAL TO allow the delivery of medicines to hostages in Gaza and aid into the territory has been agreed following mediation by Doha and Paris, Qatar and Israel announced today.
In a statement to the official Qatar News Agency, the foreign ministry announced the deal “where medicine along with other humanitarian aid is to be delivered to civilians in Gaza… in exchange for delivering medication needed for Israeli captives in Gaza”.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed the deal and said: “The medicines will be forwarded by Qatari representatives in the Gaza Strip to their final destination.”
Qatar, which hosts Hamas’s political office, has led negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian militant group, having mediated a week-long break in the war in Gaza in November which included the release of scores of Israeli and foreign hostages.
Israel pummelled southern Gaza today, killing dozens, even as authorities announced the winding down of the intense phase of the conflict that has inflamed tensions across the Middle East.
Netanyahu has come under mounting international pressure to end its offensive in Gaza launched in response to Hamas’s unprecedented 7 October attacks.
But fears are mounting the conflict could be widening, with Iran and its proxies stepping up attacks across the region in solidarity with Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules the Palestinian territory.
A wave of Israeli strikes killed at least 78 people in the Gaza Strip overnight, Hamas’s press office said. An AFP correspondent said the southern city of Khan Yunis was hit hard.
A barrage of 50 rockets was fired later toward Netivot in southern Israel, without causing any casualties, the army said. The attack was claimed by Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades.
AFPTV live footage showed trails of smoke and explosions ring out as Israeli air defences intercepted rockets near Gaza.
Fighting has ravaged Gaza since 7 October, when Hamas militants carried out an unparallelled attack on Israel that resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Militants also dragged about 250 hostages back to Gaza, 132 of whom Israel says are still in the Palestinian territory, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.

At least 24,285 Palestinians, about 70% of them women, children and adolescents, have been killed in Gaza in Israeli bombardments and ground operations since 7 October, according to the Hamas government.
Khan Yunis has been the focus of Israeli military operations since the army said on 6 January that it had dismantled Hamas’s military structures in the north and was shifting its focus to the south.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had said yesterday that intense operations would soon be winding down in the territory’s south.
“In southern Gaza we will reach this achievement and it will end soon, and in both places, the moment will come when we will move to the next phase,” he said, without giving a time frame.
The army announced today the death of two more soldiers in Gaza, bringing the total number killed since its ground invasion began to 190.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres yesterday reiterated calls to stop the fighting.
“We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to ensure sufficient aid gets to where it is needed, to facilitate the release of the hostages, to tamp down the flames of wider war – because the longer the conflict in Gaza continues, the greater the risk of escalation and miscalculation,” he said.
Israeli officials have repeatedly warned the fighting will go on for months.
Violence involving regional allies of Iran-backed Hamas – considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union – has surged since the conflict began.
Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who say they act in solidarity with Gaza, claimed a missile strike on a US-owned cargo ship yesterday, just days after the United States and Britain bombed scores of targets inside the country in response to repeated attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.
In another such attack, a missile struck a Greek-owned cargo ship in the Red Sea off Yemen, maritime risk management company Ambrey said today.
The US military said it had seized Iranian-made missile parts that were en route to the Huthis on a boat in the Arabian Sea.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it carried out an overnight missile attack that destroyed “the Zionist regime’s” (Israel) spy headquarters in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.

The IRGC said it also struck a “gathering of anti-Iranian terrorist groups” in the Iraqi Kurdistan capital Arbil and hit a number of Islamic State group sites in Syria.
Iraq condemned the strikes as an “attack on its sovereignty”.
It dismissed Iran’s claim it had hit an Israeli intelligence base, saying it struck a businessman’s house and he was among four people killed.
Iran defended the strikes, saying they were a “targeted operation” and “just punishment” against those who breach its security.
Today, the Israeli army said it conducted air and artillery strikes on Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed Shiite movement across the border in Lebanon.
The UN says the Israel-Hamas conflict has displaced roughly 85% of Gaza’s 2.4 million people, many of whom have been forced to crowd into shelters and struggle to get food, water, fuel and medical care.
As temperatures plunge, families living in makeshift tents in the southern city of Rafah have resorted to burning plastic to ward off the chill, despite the noxious fumes.
The Israeli public, meanwhile, has kept up pressure on the government to secure the return of the hostages seized by Hamas, with the militant group yesterday announcing the deaths of two more captives.
The Al-Qassam Brigades released a video showing a woman hostage, speaking under duress, revealing that two men she was held with had been killed in captivity. It blamed “the Zionist army’s bombing” for their deaths.
Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari rejected the cause of death as a “lie”, but added: “We know that we hit targets near the location where they were held”, saying an investigation was under way.

"'Intensive' phase of conflict in south Gaza 'will end soon', Israeli defence minister says","LAST UPDATE|15 Jan
ISRAEL HAS SAID the “intensive” phase of its assault on Hamas in devastated southern Gaza would end “soon” as the UN chief pleaded for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”.
Hamas announcedthe death of two of the Israeli captivesit abducted during its October attack that triggered the conflict, in a video Israel condemned as a “brutal use of innocent hostages”.
Fighting has ravaged the Gaza Strip since 7 October, when Hamas militants carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel that resulted in about 1,140 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel began a relentless military campaign that has killed at least 24,100 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
The army had stepped up operations and bombardments in the southern cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah in recent weeks after saying Hamas’s military structures in the north had been dismantled.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told a news conference today that an “intense manoeuvring stage” due to last around three months “will end soon” in southern Gaza.
He said the stage was already being reached in northern Gaza, with Israel’s army confirming one of its four divisions in the territory completed its withdrawal today.
The cabinet approved an amended 2024 budget including an additional 55 billion shekels (€13.3 billion) to meet the cost of the conflict, a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said fighting would still continue for months.

The UN says more than three months of conflict have displaced roughly 85% of Gaza’s population, crowded into shelters and struggling to get food, water, fuel and medical care.
Israel is facing heavy international pressure over Gaza’s humanitarian crisis and growing number of civilian casualties, with the territory’s health ministry reporting 60 deaths in overnight bombardment.
Deadly violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, exchanges of fire over Israel’s border with Lebanon, and strikes by US forces and Iran-backed Yemeni rebels in the Red Sea have raised fears of an escalation beyond the Gaza Strip.

UN chief Antonio Guterres today reiterated calls for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, “to ensure sufficient aid gets to where it is needed. To facilitate the release of the hostages. To tamp down the flames of wider war”.
AFPTV footage has shown smoke billowing over Khan Yunis, southern Gaza’s main city, as explosions could be heard from nearby Rafah, on the territory’s southern border with Egypt.
As temperatures plunge, families living in makeshift tents in Rafah have resorted to burning plastic to ward off the chill, despite the noxious fumes.
Echoing earlier warnings of a fast-approaching famine, UN agencies earlier called on Israel to allow access to its Ashdod port, north of Gaza, for critical aid deliveries.
Violence involving regional allies of Iran-backed Hamas – considered a “terrorist” group by the United States and the European Union – has surged since the conflict began.
Attacks by Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who say they act in solidarity with Gaza, have disrupted shipping in the vital Red Sea maritime trade route, triggering strikes on scores of rebel targets last Friday by US and British forces.
The Houthisclaimed a missile attackon a US-owned cargo ship off Yemen today, a day after firing a cruise missile at an American destroyer before it was shot down.
Since October, violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where three Palestinians were killed Monday in separate clashes with the Israeli army, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The Israeli army said its troops had opened fire and killed one person in Dura, near Hebron, after a crowd of around 100 “hurled Molotov cocktails and blocks” at them.
In central Israel, which has been largely spared the current violence, a suspected car ramming attack today killed one woman and injured 17 other people, medics said, and police arrested two Palestinian suspects.
Discussions have opened about the future reorganisation of the Palestinian territories after the conflict.
Gallant today said a Palestinian “civilian alternative” will govern post-conflict Gaza where Israeli forces would enjoy “freedom of operation” and with Hamas unable to “rule or function as a military force”.
The future Gaza government must grow out of the Gaza Strip,” Gallant said at a press conference.

Hamas releases new video announcing deaths of two Israeli hostages taken on 7 October,"
PALESTINIAN MILITANT GROUP Hamas have released a new video announcing the death of two Israeli hostages who were taken to Gaza on 7 October.
The video showed a woman hostage named in Israeli media as Noa Argamani, 26, speaking under duress, revealing that two men she was held captive with had been killed in captivity.
It was not clear when the video was taken.
Hamas had released another video yesterday showing Argamani along with two hostages who were seen alive.

The pair – named in Israeli media as Yossi Sharabi, 53, and Itay Svirsky, 38 – were the same men announced as having been killed in today’s video.
In a statement released with today’s video, Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said the two men were killed in “the Zionist army’s bombing”.
In its unprecedented 7 October attack which triggered the Israel-Hamas conflict, militants seized about 250 hostages, 132 of whom Israeli officials says remain in Gaza, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.
Shortly after the video’s release, Israel’s defence minister Yoav Gallant told a news conference that Hamas was applying “psychological pressure” to the families of the hostages.
The army was helping the families, he said, and keeping them up to date with any developments.
“Hamas has been hit hard by the IDF (military),” he said.

“What’s left for it is to touch a sensitive nerve in Israeli society through acts of psychological abuse against the family members.”
Ruling out any ceasefire in Gaza, Gallant reiterated that the only way to get the hostages back home is by continuing to apply “military pressure”. Otherwise, he said, “nobody will talk to us” and we “will not succeed in reaching any agreements”.
Israel’s army has also slammed Hamas for releasing the video, saying it was a “brutal use of innocent hostages”.
Military spokesman Daniel Hagari rejected Hamas’s claim the two hostages were killed by Israeli bombing, saying: “This is a lie by Hamas.”

US strikes Yemen again as Houthi rebels claim attack on Greek-owned cargo ship,"LAST UPDATE|16 Jan

US FORCES HAVE carried out fresh strikes on Yemen today, an American official has said, as the Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed a missile attack on a Greek-owned cargo ship in the Red Sea.
A string of Houthi attacks and retaliatory US and British strikes have heightened fears of the Israel-Hamas conflict flaring across the region and disrupted trade in one of the world’s key maritime commercial routes.
“The US conducted self-defense strikes against four Huthi ballistic missiles that posed an imminent threat to merchant vessels and US Navy ships,” a US official said on condition of anonymity, marking at least the third such strikes in less than a week.
Maritime risk management company Ambrey had earlier said a “Malta-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier was reportedly targeted and impacted with a missile while transiting the southern Red Sea northbound”.
The ship, which has visited Israel since the outbreak of conflict in Gaza and was headed to the Suez Canal, changed course and headed to port after the incident, Ambrey said.
A source within the Greek maritime affairs ministry named the ship as the Zografia, a 24-crew vessel, and said it had been sailing from Vietnam to Israel.
The Zografia “sustained limited damage … but remains in a navigable condition, and is continuing its journey”, the source said, adding that there were no injuries on board.
The Houthis, who say they attack what they consider Israeli-linked shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza since the conflict there started on 7 October, claimed responsibility for the strike today.
They said their forces “carried out a targeting operation” against the ship with multiple naval missiles after the crew did not respond to warnings, vowing to continue such attacks “until the (Israeli) aggression stops and the siege on… the Gaza Strip is lifted”.

United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, a maritime security agency run by the British navy, also reported an “incident” in an area northwest of Saleef in Yemen, without giving further details.
The Houthis also launched attacks on American vessels on Sunday and yesterday following US and UK strikes on their territory last week.
They declared US and British interests “legitimate targets” after the Western allies struck scores of sites in rebel-held Yemen on Friday in retaliation for earlier Red Sea attacks.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland today, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan insisted his country sought “to stop the spread of conflict and to create the conditions for de-escalation”.
Earlier, Qatar’s prime minister said liquefied natural gas shipments would be affected by tensions in the Red Sea, and warned that strikes on Yemen risk aggravating the crisis.
“LNG is … as any other merchant shipments. They will be affected,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told the Forum, referring to the exchanges with the Houthis.
Alternative routes are “less efficient than the current route”, he added.
British oil giant Shell indefinitely suspended all shipments through the Red Sea last week due to the Houthi threat, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
It joins several major shipping companies in diverting vessels away from the key route between Asia and European markets, which normally carries about 12% of global maritime trade, on a major detour around southern Africa.
Bloomberg reported yesterday that at least five LNG vessels operated by Qatar had stopped en route to the Red Sea.

One woman dead and 13 injured after suspected car ramming attack in Israel,"A WOMAN HAS been killed and at least 13 people injured in a suspected car ramming in central Israel today, medics said, as police arrested two Palestinians over the reported attack.
Police said the two suspects stole vehicles and ran over a number of citizens in different areas in the city of Raanana north of Tel Aviv.
Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports that the person who died was a 79-year-old Israeli woman. Haaretz also reports that the suspected attack involved stabbings.
Medics from the Magen David Adom emergency service said of the 13 people who were wounded, two were seriously hurt, with the others suffering less serious injuries.
Hospitals in the area said they included nine children, one of whom was seriously hurt.

Meir hospital near Raanana confirmed that one woman had died.
“A wounded woman who arrived in a critical condition after having been hit by a vehicle has died of her injuries despite our efforts to save her,” the hospital said in a statement.
Haaretz reports that, according to the Israeli Police, 44-year-old Mahmoud Zidat, an illegal worker from the Palestinian town of Bani Na’im in the West Bank, was arrested after ramming civilians with three different vehicles.
The police have also detained the suspect’s nephew, 25-year-old Ahmed Zidat, who was in the car with his uncle during the attack and had later fled the scene.
A witness to the suspected attack told Haaretz that she “saw someone stab three people near the mall. (The attacker) stole a car and ran over other people.”

McDonald invokes Northern Ireland peace process in address at Pro-Palestine rally in London,"SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has referred to Ireland’s “own long journey of conflict” as she appealed for peace in a speech at a pro-Palestine rally held in London today.
McDonald took part in today’s march through the UK’s capital city, walking alongside Palestine’s ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot.
Thousands of people gathered in the city for the protest, part of a global day of action involving 30 countries, to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
Addressing the crowd, McDonald said the Palestinian “nightmare” has gone on too long.
Demanding a ceasefire, the Sinn Féin leader said:
“We seek a new horizon of freedom, of peace, of security.
“To the cynics, the indifferent, the belligerent, who say that this can’t happen, that peace and Palestinian freedom is a dream too far, I say this standing here in London, in common cause with you, having walked our own long journey out of conflict, of building a peace for twenty-five years.

Referring to South Africa’sgenocide caseagainst Israel, McDonald said the country has shown others what it means to lead.
“Israel must be held to account, the slaughter must end now, governments everywhere must call for ceasefires,” McDonald said.
“We won’t be silenced in the face of genocide – a genocide that is broadcast every day for nearly one hundred days now,” she added.
Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also spoke at the event.
Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, accused the British Government of “complicity” with Israel.
He said Palestine was a “nation of freedom fighters”, saying: “I stand before you with a broken heart, but not a broken spirit.”
Meanwhile in Ireland, thousands also gathered in Dublin city calling for an end to Israel’s campaign in Gaza, which has taken over 20,000 lives to date, according to the health ministry in the region.

Lebanon was already in crisis - now it's dealing with thousands fleeing Israel-Hezbollah conflict,"TENS OF THOUSANDS of people have been forced to flee their homes in southern Lebanon as fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated in recent weeks.
The healthcare system and humanitarian NGOs working in Lebanon are struggling to cope with the growing number of people displaced by the fighting, as the country enters its fifth year of financial crisis.
“People need mattresses, clothes and medications,” Abbas Chite, from Kfarkila in south Lebanontold the medical NGO Doctors Without Borders(MSF).
“We left everything behind when the bombardment became heavy. We can’t even go back to get our medical prescriptions or clothes.”
The Journalspoke to one humanitarian group in Beirut, who said they are training healthcare staff in how to deal with major casualty incidents in case the situation escalates.
The low-intensity conflict has involved Israeli airstrikes, rocket launches from Hezbollah and exchanges of live fire across the Lebanon-Israel border since the 7 October attack by Hamas against Israel.
The fighting has ramped up in its intensity since Israel allegedly assassinated two senior Hamas leadersin southern Lebanonandthe capital Beirut, with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallahpromising a harsh response.Israel has denied responsibility for the attacks.
This week, an Israeli strikekilled a senior Hezbollah officialin the south of the country.

“If the enemy thinks of waging a war on Lebanon, we will fight without restraint, without rules, without limits and without restrictions,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech.
“We are not afraid of war.”
In a statement issued on Tuesday, a group of UN experts said of the Israeli strike that all states are prohibited from ”arbitrarily depriving individuals of their right to life in military or security operations abroad, including when countering terrorism.
“Killings in foreign territory are arbitrary when they are not authorised under international law. Israel was not exercising self-defence because it presented no evidence that the victims were committing an armed attack on Israel from Lebanese territory.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared his intention to kill Hamas leaders outside of Palestine, saying in November 2023 that Israel will “assassinate all the leaders of Hamas wherever they are”.
The Israel-Hezbollah conflict has made it unsafe for civilians on either side of the border to remain in their homes, forcing them to seek refuge elsewhere. More than 82,000 people have been internally displaced since 8 October, according to the UN’sInternational Organisation for Migration.

Medical needs
One NGO that has been supporting the efforts of the embattled health service in Lebanon, especially in the south, is Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
The Journalspoke to MSF’s medical coordinator for Lebanon Caline Rehayem, who is based in Beirut, about the conditions of those displaced by the violence and their healthcare needs.
She says that people have been internally displaced to areas within the south of Lebanon or further to the north.
“And of course, this has affected their access to health care, in addition to essential needs and for some of them sheltering needs,” she says.
“Since 2019, the ongoing economic crisis has affected the country and the people living in Lebanon and also has put strain on the healthcare system, whether it be primary health care centres or hospitals, or secondary and tertiary healthcare centres.
“So this escalation in military activity and the impact comes is leading to compounding impact on the healthcare system.”
MSF has a mobile medical team that is supporting two health centres in Nabatieh district in the south, providing care for patients with chronic diseases as well as psychological first aid.
Patients treated by MSF staff have presented with various medical problems, from chronic illnesses like diabetes and hypertension, to mental health issues resulting from escaping airstrikes.

Another common issue is that, because people have had to leave all of a sudden, many did not bring possessions with them, including medical records and prescriptions, something MSF and Lebanese healthcare workers are assisting with.
“So with displacement, people leave their homes and so might not have the time or the capacity to have taken their medical records, medical prescriptions or medications,” says Rehayem.
“So MSF has deployed a mobile medical unit that is supporting two primary health care centers in the south, … where we are supporting internally displaced patients to have a continuity of care and continue to access medical consultations and have access to their medications.”
These efforts are being made in coordination with the Lebanese Ministry of Health.
Basic necessities are in short supply for those displaced by the ongoing violence. People are in need of things like mattresses and blankets, food and water and personal hygiene items, Rehayem says.
The prospect of the conflict escalating further is something that MSF and the Lebanese health authorities are taking into account as well. Rehayem says their teams have “upscaled their preparedness and response capacity” in anticipation of that possibility.
“In addition to the mobile activity that I mentioned, MSF teams have also provided training, also in line with the Ministry of Public Health, Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan.
MSF doctors are training health personnel in different hospitals in Lebanon in trauma care and mass casualty incident management. The NGO has also prepositioned medical supplies “in order for this to be reachable for use in case of escalation,” Rehayem said.
Compounding crises
Estella Carpi, a lecturer in humanitarian studies at University College London, says that the Lebanese economy has been under pressure for over a decade, but particularly in the last few years. The country’s reception of refugees from Syria and Palestine has exacerbated the strain on public services and the activities of NGOs, which were already struggling, she explains.
“Since 2011, Lebanon has been hosting the largest number of refugees ever in its history because of the conflict in Syria. So that definitely put an extra burden on local welfare provision and services and NGOs have been increasingly under-resourced… facing budget shortfalls as never before, basically.”
The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have also compounded these difficulties, Carpi says.
“The other thing is surely the pandemic… as [with] anywhere else, it made the economic collapse in Lebanon even more severe.
“Lots of people lost jobs, lost their livelihoods, and of course in this scenario, refugees have always been the the weakest segment of the local population, as you can imagine, because they normally struggle to generate their own livelihoods on a daily basis even in times of, let’s say, stability or economic decency.”
Carpi mentions another notable incident in recent years that did damage to the Lebanese economy and the reputation of the government: theexplosion at the Port of Beirut in August 2020, which killed over 200 people and injured more than 7,000.
Despite an influx in foreign investment and financial aid from other countries in the aftermath of the explosion, much of that money has gone towards promoting tourism, nightlife and the service economy, rather than to addressing the needs of those most in need, Carpi explains.
“As always, investments coming from outside try to create their own ground for benefits in the economic interest for foreign agendas, rather than prioritising the needs of the weakest segments of the local demography, as it has always been in the history of reconstructions in Lebanon.
“I think these three historical moments [the war in Syria, the pandemic and the port explosion], in a sense, have made things even worse in Lebanon economically speaking, so even before the break out of this sort of low intensity conflict between Israel and Hezbollah,” she says.
What happens next
The potential for the violence to intensify remains, but the current level is already hampering the ability of NGOs to provide care to affected people in the south, says Carpi.
“I’m afraid that if it remains low intensity, you’re not going to have lots of NGOs helping out there because, of course, it’s not the priority as the largest humanitarian crisis is happening in Gaza, and not in Lebanon,” she says.
“And also because many NGOs that were the ones compensating for the state not providing anything in Lebanon, even to refugees, like kind of moved to Ukraine in 2022. And so you saw lots of offices shutting down.
“People are really not receiving much. I’m in regular conversation like with people in the South that I’ve known for years and there is really not much help for the internally displaced honestly.
“So the long term is quite scary to their eyes because you’re just living in a school and you don’t know how to continue your daily life, basically.”

Mary Lou McDonald to address rally in London calling for ceasefire in Gaza,"SINN FÉIN PRESIDENT Mary Lou McDonald is set to address a rally in London tomorrow which will call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
The rally, which is being organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, will take place at 12pm tomorrow in the UK capital.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected to take part in the rally as part of a global day of action for Palestine involving 30 countries, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign said.
McDonald has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory since the ongoing conflict began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October.
Sinn Féin have also said that the position of Israeli Ambassador to Ireland is “untenable”, and this week called on the Government to join South Africa’s genocide case against Israel.
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 23,708 people, mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
The Hamas attack resulted in the death of about 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
The Metropolitan Police has said a “significant policing presence” will be seen in London this weekend, with about 1,700 officers on duty to police the march tomorrow, including many from forces outside the capital.
A number of conditions will be in place, the force said, including: Any person participating in the procession must not deviate from the route specified; the speeches at the assembly following the procession must end by 4.30pm and the whole event must end by 5pm; no participant in the protest may enter the area around the Israeli Embassy.
The majority of protests and other events held in recent months have taken place without any notable disorder, the Met Police said, but there has been a number of arrests.

There have been repeated examples of placards, banners and other items being carried or worn, or statements being chanted, that have crossed the line into religiously or racially aggravated offences – some have even been so serious as to be dealt with under the Terrorism Act, the force added.
The Met’s Counter Terrorism Command has launched around 30 investigations into suspected offending at protests since 7 October, the majority of which relate to potential terrorism offences.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor, who will lead the policing operation this weekend, said: “We absolutely recognise the passion and strength of feeling sparked by the ongoing conflict and we respect the right of those who wish to protest and have their voices heard to do so.
“We police without fear or favour and where our policing approach differs it is a response to the intelligence and the nature of the event, not those taking part or the cause they represent,” he said.
“Officers are present primarily to ensure the safety of those involved, but where we see offences taking place, or where we are made aware of them either online or by other means, we will not hesitate to act.
“These protests and the offences connected to them have been widely reported on in the media and have been the subject of extensive discussions online.
“It is really disappointing that despite this, we have continued to see people turning up carrying placards, wearing clothing or chanting slogans that, certainly by this stage, they should know will cause alarm or distress to others.
“I would appeal to those attending any protest event, whether this weekend or in the future, to consider how their actions will impact on the safety and security of others.
“Those who intentionally push the limits of what may cross the line into criminality will face the consequences.
“I would encourage anyone at the protests who feels unsafe, or sees anything they are concerned about, to speak to an officer.”

"‘Track-record of impunity’ around killing of media in Gaza, says Committee to Protect Journalists","THE COMMITTEE TO Protect Journalists (CPJ) has warned that there is a “track-record of impunity” around the killing of journalists in Gaza.
The CPJ is an independent, non-profit organisation that promotes press freedom worldwide.
Itslatest account of journalist deaths since fighting broke out on 7 October shows that at least 82 journalists or media workers have been killed.
Of the 82 journalists and media workers killed, 75 were Palestinian, four were Israeli, and three were Lebanese.
Three journalists have also been reported missing and 25 were reportedly arrested.
In total, Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 23,708 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest health ministry figures.
Sherif Mansour is the CPJ’s Middle-East and North Africa program co-ordinator.
“I’ve been in this role for 11 years now,” says Mansour, “which means this is my fourth Gaza war.”
He notes that Gaza has “always dangerous for journalists”.
“Last year, we published areport called ‘Deadly Pattern’ on the first anniversary of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.”
Abu Akleh was a Palestinian-American who was killed on 11 May, 2022, while covering a raid on a refugee bank in Jenin in the West Bank.
She was killed by an Israeli soldier while wearing a blue press vest.

Mansour toldThe Journal: “At the time we published that report, we wanted to highlight that she was one of 20 journalists that have been killed with impunity by Israeli fire since 2001.
“The ‘Deadly Pattern’ continues and today, our latest update shows that 82 journalists and media workers have been killed.”
Mansour toldThe Journalthat there have been cases in the current conflict where journalists have been killed “outside of crossfire without posing any threat” and when press insignia was visible.
He added that Palestinian journalists have been “killed after receiving threats from Israeli soldiers” and that family members of journalists have also been killed.
Mansour called for these incidents to be independently investigated.
“There is a track-record of impunity when it comes to killing journalists that we don’t want to see happen this time around,” said Mansour.
“We have called for these to be investigated, including by the International Criminal Court, and when appropriate,will call for the FBI to disclose their findings about the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh.”

Mansour also called for the “immediate end of censorship of international media by allowing them access to Gaza”.
The Israeli High Court this week ruled that the Israeli military can continue barring foreign journalists from accessing the Gaza Strip.
It cited “extreme security concerns and concrete security threats that go with approving entry permits for independent journalists”.
Only Gazans or correspondents accompanied by the Israeli army have been able to report from inside the region.
Mansour also criticised the recent killing of Al Jazeera journalists Hamza Wael Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuria.
Dahdouh and Thuria were killed on Sunday when the car they were travelling in was hit by two rockets on a street in Rafah.
A third journalist and the driver of the car were wounded.
The Israeli army claimed the men were “members of Gaza-based terrorist organisations actively involved in attacks against IDF (army) forces”.

However, Al Jazeera yesterday said this was a “false and misleading attempt to justify the killing of our colleagues”.
Speaking toThe Journal, Mansour said responses like these by the Israeli army are “designed to evade responsibility, including pushing false narratives of the journalists being terrorists”.
He also accused Israel of claiming that journalists have been killed in crossfire “when later evidence shows this wasn’t the case”.
Mansour also noted that the number of international media in Gaza has been “dwindling over the years” due to attacks in the region.
“Much of the international media rely on Palestinian colleagues as freelancers or as correspondents, and the majority of those who have been killed are freelancers of international organisations.
“Without them, we don’t have access to timely and independent information and we would have to rely on propaganda or misinformation that can only fuel the conflict.
“We want both local and international media in order to hold power to account.”
However, Mansour cautioned that when “no one is held accountable for killing Palestinian journalists, it creates a chilling effect on journalists to cover Israeli army activities”.
He toldThe Journal: “With every journalist killed, we lose a window to reality and those brave journalists continue to make those sacrifices after seeing their colleagues and their families killed because they want their communities and their voices heard on camera.”
“There are long-term implications and also immediate ones.
“The journalism here has lifesaving consequences for two million people in Gaza who are struggling to find food, clean water and shelter.
“But it also directly impacts on the hundreds and millions of people all over the world who are trying to understand this heartbreaking conflict.”

"MSF says healthcare system in Gaza has 'virtually collapsed' as death toll hits more than 23,700","LAST UPDATE|12 Jan

MÉDECINS SANS FRONTIÉRES (MSF) has said the healthcare system in Gaza has “virtually collapsed”, with “constant” evacuation orders and attacks on health facilities repeatedly forcing health organisations to evacuate hospitals and leave patients behind.
Telecommunication services were cut across besieged Gaza today, after Israeli strikes killed dozens in southern cities where hundreds of thousands are struggling to survive hunger and cold on the 98th day of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.
In Gaza, an AFP journalist reported strikes and shelling hitting areas between the territory’s southern cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah, which is crowded with people who have fled from the north.
Overnight, the bombardment killed at least 59 people and wounded dozens more across the besieged territory, the health ministry in Gaza said.
The Israeli military said it had killed seven “terrorists” in a strike in Khan Yunis and a further 20 in the Maghazi area to the north.
AFP footage showed black smoke billowing over Rafah and Khan Yunis.
“Does anyone care about us? Why is everyone silent?” asked one mourner at a hospital where a group of Palestinians had gathered beside white body bags of the latest casualties.
Elsewhere in Rafah, resident Fayad Abu Rjeila surveyed the wreckage of a building after an Israeli strike he said had killed civilians in their homes.
“They had nothing to do with anything. People who just wanted to live,” he told AFP.
“Why did they target them?”
Israel’s military said its ground forces and air strikes had destroyed more than 700 rocket launchers in Gaza since the ongoing conflict began on 7 October.
In a statement today, MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said the Israeli forces’ assault on Gaza “has drastically diminished the options for people to find medical care”.

Three months into the conflict, the NGO said the amount of safe space for organisations to provide healthcare to people is now virtually non-existent.

“We’re gradually being cornered in a very restrictive perimeter in southern Gaza, in Rafah, with dwindling options to offer critical medical assistance, while the needs are desperately growing,” Thomas Lauvin, MSF project coordinator in Gaza, said.
“As the assault on Gaza has progressed, we have had to evacuate several health facilities in the north of Gaza, then in the Middle Area. Today we are limited to mainly working in the south, because we cannot work elsewhere.
The NGO said that medical facilities and their surrounding areas have repeatedly been hit by Israeli Forces and been subjected to evacuation orders in different parts of Gaza, particularly in the north, making access to, and the provision of, healthcare too dangerous.
It said that several hospitals where MSF was working have been through this situation, including the Indonesian hospital in north Gaza and Al-Shifa hospital.
Al Awda hospital, MSF’s partner hospital since 2018, was hit in November. Three doctors were killed, two of them were among MSF staff.
“Now, this pattern is repeating itself in the south, which hosts five times the number of people it did before the war, and fewer places to provide people healthcare.”
MSF said the lack of hospital capacity is depriving patients of adequate treatment and proper hygienic conditions, which is resulting in increasing numbers of infected wounds and medical procedures being carried out in “extreme conditions”.
“Beyond critical injuries, many women who underwent c-section are discharged just six hours after delivery to make space for other pregnant women, while some are simply turned away and give birth in tents.”
MSF added that it remains committed to providing medical care in Gaza and called for the protection of hospitals, medical staff and patients.
Today, all internet and telecommunications services in Gaza were cut as a result of the Israeli bombardment of the Palestinian territory, the main operator Paltel said.
“Gaza is blacked out again,” it said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 23,708 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.
The ministry added that it has registered 60,005 wounded, while scores remain trapped under the rubble
Vowing to eliminate Hamas, Israel has carried out a relentless bombardment, alongside a ground invasion, since Hamas fighters attacked Israel on 7 October.
The unprecedented attack by the Islamist group resulted in the death of about 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
The charity Oxfam International said yesterday that the daily death toll in Gaza was higher than in any other major conflict this century, with an average of 250 people killed daily.
Oxfam’s Sally Abi Khalil said it is “unimaginable” that the international community stands by “while continuously blocking calls for a ceasefire”.
In northern Gaza, the World Health Organization said it had reached Gaza’s largest hospital on Thursday, delivering desperately needed fuel and medical supplies.
“The team reported that Al-Shifa, previously Gaza’s premier hospital, has (partially) re-established services,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X.
Andrea De Domenico, head of the UN aid agency OCHA’s office in the occupied Palestinian territories, told AFP on Friday Israel was constantly blocking humanitarian aid convoys into northern Gaza.
“But in particular, they have been very systematic to not allowing us to support hospitals, which is something that is reaching a point of a level of inhumanity that for me is beyond comprehension,” he said.
Amid fears of Israel’s war against Hamas spreading, American and British forces launched early morning raids against Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthis, after the rebels targeted shipping in the Red Sea they said was linked to Israel.
Violence involving Tehran-aligned groups in Yemen, as well as in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, has surged since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.

Irish MEPs say Ireland should have supported South Africa's genocide case against Israel,"FIANNA FÁIL MEPS Barry Andrews and Billy Kelleher have said Ireland should have joined South Africa in its genocide case against Israel.
The position of Fianna Fáil MEPs comes after party leader and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin suggested opposition TDs wereattempting to “create division”by calling on Ireland join the case.
Thecasebegan in the International Court of Justice in the Hague yesterday.
South Africa alleges that Israel is in violation of theGenocide Convention of 1948in three ways: by committing acts of genocide, by failing to prevent genocide and by failing to prevent and punish incitement to genocide. Israel has denied the accusations and described the South African case as an “absurd blood libel”.
Arguing its case in the Haguetoday, Israel’s defence team hit back at what it describes as “atrocious” allegations it is committing “genocide” in Gaza.
Ireland has refused to join the case taken by South Africa, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar saying it is an area where “we need to be very careful”.
The refusal is despitesignificant pressure fromopposition parties.
Speaking toThe JournalAndrews, Dublin MEP and former chief executive of humanitarian response agency GOAL, said he believes the circumstances in Gaza are “so grave and urgent” that action was required from Ireland.
“The circumstances currently in Gaza are so bad that if it was good enough for the Ukraine case then this is also proportionally bad enough to trigger the convention and Ireland should have joined South Africa in the case,” Andrews said.
In 2022 Ireland filed an intervention in a case taken by Ukraine against Russia under the Genocide Convention.
Andrews said while he thinks it was the wrong decision for the Irish government not to join the South Africa case, he said “in fairness, the government has taken a lot of other progressive steps”.
“The government are doing an awful lot and I can understand to some extent the case is live anyway, it doesn’t add anything whether Ireland is in it or not, but if we did it before with Ukraine it seems to me the circumstances are sufficiently grave and urgent to do the same here,” Andrews said.

Fellow-Fianna Fáil MEP Billy Kelleher, for Ireland South, agreed with his party colleague.
He toldThe Journal:
He said the Irish state “should have supported South Africa’s case”, given its longstanding position on the conflict.
Other Irish MEPs also shared the same sentiment for South Africa’s genocide case against Israel.
Speaking toThe Journal, Green MEP for Ireland South, Grace O’Sullivan said Ireland should formally intervene followingthis week’s interim hearingwith an official observation.
Leader of the Green Party, Eamon Ryansaid this weekthat there are “irrefutable” points in South Africa’s genocide case against Israel but he did not signal a desire for Ireland to join the case.
O’Sullivan said she fully supports the case brought by South Africa to investigate Israeli breaches of the Genocide Convention.
“It is also important that the Irish government states clearly and in unison that we support all investigations into genocide in Gaza, as is our obligation under the Genocide Convention,” O’Sullivan said.
She added that she believes it is important for the state to support the case at “this difficult hour” for the people of Gaza.
In addition to her calls for Ireland to formally intervene in the case O’Sullivan said at a European level the EU-Israel Association Agreement (which facilitates trade between Israel and Europe) must be suspended.
“The agreement is underpinned by respect for human rights under Article 2 and this has clearly been violated by Israel in Gaza and in the West Bank.

“Time is running out for us to stop them,” the MEP said.
Fellow-Green MEP Ciarán Cuffe said that Ireland should support South Africa’s case “either by formally intervening or by filing a separate case against Israel”.
“As a state party to the Genocide Convention, Ireland has a legal obligation to act,” he added.
Cuffe said that he hopes the court will grant South Africa’s request for provisional measures and that it demands Israel immediately cease any acts “capable of killing or causing serious harm to Palestinians”.
Cuffe said: “These measures would also ensure that the Israeli government and military are held accountable for their actions in Gaza and the West Bank.”
“As members of a Union founded on the principles of human rights and the rule of law, EU countries should be playing a greater role to end the violence and deliver a permanent ceasefire. By showing leadership, Ireland may encourage others to do the same,” he added.
Outside the court in The Hague in The Netherlands yesterday, independent MEPs Clare Daly and Mick Wallace stood among protesters in support of Palestine.
MEPs Mick Wallace (L) and Clare Daly outside the International Court of Justice in The Hague yesterday.Mick Wallace on XMick Wallace on X
In a letter the pair penned to the Taoiseach, Wallace and Daly expressed their “deep disappointment” over the remarks Varadkar had made, claiming that he went gave “examples of genocides you are willing to recognise as such, with the implication that these somehow provide a form of contrast with Israel’s actions in Gaza”.
The letter reads: “In the process you made mention of the Holocaust, during which 6 million Jews were exterminated by Nazi Germany. ‘That is a genocide,’ you stated.
“It is beyond dispute that the Holocaust was indeed a genocide, a ‘crime of crimes.’
“However, it is dismaying to see its incontrovertible status as such used in public statements by the Irish Head of Government with the effect of minimising the applicability of the Genocide Convention to what Israel is doing in Gaza, as if the comparison made clear that what Palestinians are suffering cannot amount to genocide,” the pair argued.
“It does not make that clear, nor does it excuse Ireland, as a State Party, of its affirmative obligations under the Convention,” they added.
Speaking toThe Journal, Daly said the very least the Irish government should be doing is issuing a statement in support of the South African case.
Fellow independent MEP for The Left group, Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan toldThe Journal: “It’s beyond shameful that Ireland has not supported the South African case at the ICJ.
“We’ve had lots of huffing and puffing from the coalition leaders on the genocide occurring before our very eyes in Gaza. However when push comes to shove it has amounted to nothing,” he added.
Flanagan said: “How Ireland isn’t supporting this case is unfathomable. Our government is undoubtedly on the wrong side of history.
Responding on behalf of the Fine Gael Delegation in the European Parliament, Ireland South’s Seán Kelly renewed calls for a “humanitarian ceasefire and for a peaceful end to the conflict in Gaza as soon as possible”.
Kelly, who is also the longest serving Irish MEP, said: “It is appropriate for the ICJ to make a judgement on this case and we await its outcome.
“But above all, I want to strongly urge all sides to work for a peaceful resolution so that no more innocent lives, particularly young children, will be lost or damaged needlessly.”
Sinn Féin MEP Chris MacManus toldThe Journalthat he was “deeply disappointed” Ireland did not join the case.
“The international community must hold Israel to account and do everything possible to achieve an immediate permanent ceasefire and work towards a peaceful resolution,” the Midlands North West MEP said.
These calls come as a letter from over 1,000 healthcare workers to the government has called for the state to support South Africa’s case. The letter included the signature of the Irish Medical Council President, Dr Suzanne Crowe.
Dr Ola Løkken Nordrum, a specialist anaesthesiology trainee in St. Vincent’s University Hospital, toldThe Journal: “As healthcare workers, we have a duty to advocate for the sick, the injured, and the victims of this man-made humanitarian crisis.”
He detailed that patients, including children, are havingamputations and other operations conducted without anaesthesia. “We cannot remain silent,” Nordum said.

As it happened: Israel argues its defence in South Africa's Gaza genocide case at The Hague,"LAST UPDATE|12 Jan
ISRAEL HAS TODAY hit back at what it describes as “atrocious” allegations it is committing “genocide” in Gaza, in a closely watched landmark case before the UN’s top court.
South Africa has launched the emergency case at the International Court of Justice arguing that Israel stands in breach of the UN Genocide Convention, signed in 1948 in the wake of the Holocaust.
Pretoria wants judges to force Israel to “immediately” stop the Gaza campaign launched after the devastating 7 October Hamas attacks.
Opening the case yesterday, South African Justice Minister Ronald Lamola told the court that Israel had “crossed the line” and was in breach of the Convention.
He said that even the brutality of the Hamas attack could not justify this.
Legal advisor for Israel Dr Tal Becker told the court today that ”what Israel seeks by operating in Gaza is not to destroy a people but to protect the people, its people who are under attack on multiple fronts and to do so in accordance with the law, even when it faces a heartless enemy determined to use that very commitment against it”.
Here is how Israel’s submission played out today.

The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has long been a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause, often linking it to its own struggle against the white-minority government, which had cooperative relations with Israel.

How has Israel responded to the case being taken before the ICJ?
Israel and its ally the United States have dismissed the case as groundless and vowed a robust defence at the Peace Palace in The Hague.
“No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas,” said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the run-up to the hearings.
“We will continue our defensive war, the justice and morality of which is without peer,” he added.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the South African case was “unfounded”.
“In fact, it is those who are violently attacking Israel who continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews,” said Miller.

Explainer: Why did the US and UK just launch airstrikes in Yemen?,"LAST NIGHT, US and British forcesbombed more than a dozen sitesused by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen in a massive retaliatory strike using warship-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets.
This development comes as tensions have been rising after Iranian-backed Houthi rebels began striking at ships passing through the Red Sea in recent weeks.
The Islamist group claims it began striking a narrow strip of sea between Yemen and east Africa, which is a key international trade route, in a bid to end Israel’s air and ground offensive against Hamas.
The overnight strikes on Yemen are the most significant military response against the Houthis’ campaign to date.
The Houthis have close ties with Iran, which has been involved in conflict with Saudi Arabia, which shares a border with Yemen, over regional influence.
Here’s what you need to know.
The Shia militant group emerged in the 1990s and its supporters mainly come from the ranks of Zaidi Shia Muslims and the Houthi tribe.
It claimed former president Ali Abudllah Saleh had grown too close to Saudi Arabia and Israel, and tensions between them grew for several years.
The death of the group’s founder, Hussein al Houthi, at the hands of the Yemeni military led to the Houthi insurgency from 2004.
The group later participated in the 2011 Yemeni revolution.
The rebels rose to prominence after capturing Yemen’s capital Sana’a in 2014, sparking a civil war which is estimated to have killed almost 400,000 people.
They captured more territory after aligning with Mr Saleh in 2015 and now control much of western Yemen down to the Bab al Mandeb Strait, a 16-mile stretch of water which marks the entrance to the Red Sea.
The group’s takeover of the capital prompted Saudi Arabia to intervene in a bid to restore the internationally recognised government, which has a Sunni majority.
A Saudi and UAE bombing campaign against Houthi targets was launched in 2015 and drew criticism over civilian deaths, leading to calls for the UK to cease arms exports to Saudi Arabia.

The Shia militant group is allied to Iran, as are Hamas and Hezbollah, and seeks to reduce western influence in the Middle East.
Its slogan includes the words “death to America”, “death to Israel” and “a curse upon the Jews”.

Tehran has been accused of providing arms, training and financial support to the Houthis.
The Houthi rebels say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in response to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza after the 7 October attack, and have launched a series of drones and missiles towards Israel.
Israel has also been facing cross-border fire along its northern frontier from Iran-backed militants in Syria and Lebanon – particularly the Hamas-aligned Hezbollah – and has responded with strikes of its own in both countries.
As noted above, the Houthis claim to have begun striking an area of the Red Sea between Yemen and east Africa, which is a key international trade route, in a bid to end Israel’s air and ground offensive against Hamas.
Since the eruption of the conflict in Gaza sparked by Hamas’s unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, the Houthis have carried out a growing number of attacks on the trade route.
On Tuesday, the Houthis launched what London called their most significant attack yet, with US and British forces shooting down 18 drones and three missiles.
The final straw for the Western allies appeared to come early yesterday when the US military said the Houthis fired an anti-ship ballistic missile into a shipping lane in the Gulf of Aden.
It was the 27th attack on international shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November, the US military said.
The intensifying attacks have caused shipping companies to divert around South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, sparking fears of a shock to the global economy.
The United States and its allies had issued a series of increasingly stern warnings to the Houthis to stop the shipping attacks, although Washington has been wary of inflaming regional tensions.
Washington set up an international coalition in December – dubbed Operation Prosperity Guardian – to protect maritime traffic in the area, through which 12% of world trade flows.
Twelve nations led by the United States warned the Houthis on 3 January of “consequences” unless they immediately stopped attacks on commercial vessels.

Last night, heavy US and British air strikes pounded targets in rebel-held Yemen.
The strikes targeted an airbase, airports and a military camp, the Houthi rebels’ Al-Masirah TV station said, with AFP correspondents and witnesses also reporting they could hear bombardments.
The strikes involved fighter jets and Tomahawk missiles, the US Air Forces Central Command said in a statement. Sixty targets at 16 Houthi locations were hit by more than 100 precision-guided munitions, it said.
“Today, at my direction, US military forces – together with the United Kingdom and with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands – successfully conducted strikes against a number of targets in Yemen used by Houthi rebels to endanger freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most vital waterways,” US President Joe Biden said in a statement.
Unverified images on social media, some of them purportedly of Al-Dailami airbase north of Sanaa, showed explosions lighting up the sky as loud bangs and the roar of planes sounded.
Biden called the strikes a “direct response” to the “unprecedented” attacks by the Houthis, “including the use of anti-ship ballistic missiles for the first time in history”.

Blaming the Houthis for ignoring “repeated warnings”, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement the strikes were “necessary and proportionate”.
US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes “targeted sites associated with the Houthis’ unmanned aerial vehicle, ballistic and cruise missile, and coastal radar and air surveillance capabilities”.
The US and Britain “will have to prepare to pay a heavy price and bear all the dire consequences of this blatant aggression”, Houthi Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Al-Ezzi has said.
The Houthis said there was “no justification” for the air strikes and warned that attacks on Israel-linked shipping would continue.
“We affirm that there is absolutely no justification for this aggression against Yemen, as there was no threat to international navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas, and the targeting was and will continue to affect Israeli ships or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine,” Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam posted on X, formerly Twitter.
A joint statement by the United States, Britain, Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand and South Korea said the “aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea”.
“But let our message be clear: we will not hesitate to defend lives and protect the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threats,” it said.
Yemen’s neighbour Saudi Arabia, which is trying to end its involvement in a nine-year war with the Houthis, urged against escalation.
“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is following with great concern the military operations,” a foreign ministry statement said, calling for “self-restraint and avoiding escalation”.
Iran has condemned the strikes on Yemen,  saying they were an “arbitrary action” and a “violation” of international law.
Russia has also condemned strikes by the US and Britain as an “escalation” with “destructive objectives”.
China has called for all sides to prevent the Yemen conflict from expanding.
“China is concerned about the escalation of tensions in the Red Sea,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said, adding: “We urge the relevant parties to keep calm and exercise restraint, to prevent the conflict from expanding.”

Tánaiste: Calls for govt to join genocide case against Israel are 'trying to create division' in Ireland,"TÁNAISTE MICHEÁL MARTIN has said that some opposition parties are trying to “create division” in Ireland by calling on the Government to join South Africa in their genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
Thefirst day of hearingsin The Hague today saw South Africa accuse Israel of committing “genocidal” acts in Gaza, charges the country’s president dismissed as “atrocious” and “preposterous”.
Israel will set out its defence tomorrow.
A number of opposition partieshave repeatedly called on the Irish governmentto join South Africa in its ICJ proceedings.
Today, Sinn Féin’s spokesperson on Foreign Affairs Matt Carthy welcomed the country’s decision to take the case under the Genocide Convention.
“As a signatory to the Convention, the Irish government is also legally obliged to take action to prevent genocide and, in Sinn Féin’s view, they should reverse position,” Carthy said.
“The people of Ireland will be closely watching the hearing now underway at The Hague. They will rightly be demanding that the Irish government shows leadership on the international stage in standing up for the people of Palestine against these outrageous war crimes.”
People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett also urged the Irish government to join South Africa’s case, along with Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns, who wrote a letter to the Taoiseach urging him to join the case or to initiate separate proceedings against Israel.
Speaking to reporters in Colombia today, the Tánaiste said that Ireland’s position on Palestine is “very strong” internationally.
“I was taken aback by some of the commentary of the opposition during the week just on the specific issue of the Genocide Convention, which is in itself a complex issue and shouldn’t be portrayed as something that’s very simple,” he said.

“I don’t think it’s good enough, frankly, and we can agree to disagree with the opposition on that, but this kind of approach of trying to create division within Ireland is one that I don’t think is a correct approach, and is fair either in terms of the assessment of Ireland’s position in respect of the Middle Eastern issue in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
“And indeed, we know how Israel views Ireland in terms of the stances that we’ve consistently taken in respect of this.”
Martin said that while the Government believes Israel should be held accountable for its actions in Gaza, he said it’s equally important that Hamas is held to account for “some of the horrific violations that they have engaged in”.
“As I said, I’m in no doubt that there have been breaches of international humanitarian law. There has to be accountability, and Israel will have to be held accountable, but the immediate focus has to be on a humanitarian ceasefire.”
During his visit to Kosovo today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told reporters that Ireland could play a role if the ICJ issue an order to half the conflict while the case is still being considered.
“The South African case might allow the International Court of Justice to make an order calling for the fighting to stop while the case is considered over the next number of years, and I think that’s where Ireland could play a role, if the ICJ issue such an order,” he said.
“But also bear in mind, they have issued such an order in relation to Russia’s actions in Ukraine and Russia took the decision to ignore it, and I would be afraid that Israel would do the same.”
The Taoiseachruled outjoining South Africa’s case last week.
“That case will be heard,” he said, adding that it will be up to the Court to make its determination.
“Genocide is something very particular,” he said. “It is defined as the deliberate attempt to destroy an entire nation or entire race or to do so in large part.
“And one group of people that has experienced that in the world are Jewish people, the Holocaust, 6 million Jews killed here in Europe and Hitler had a plan to kill many millions more. That is genocide.
“And of course, there have been other examples of genocide such as the Armenian Genocide, and what’s happened to some indigenous people, for example, in the new world. We need to be very careful about genocide in that context.”

Irish lawyer tells Hague that Gaza is 'first genocide in history' being broadcast in 'real-time',"AN IRISH LAWYER has told the International Court of Justice that conflict in Gaza is the “first genocide in history” being broadcast in “real-time”.
Launching a landmark case at the top UN court today, South Africa accused Israel of breaching the UN Genocide Convention, a treaty signed in 1948 in the wake of the Holocaust.
It is arguing that even the deadly 7 October Hamas attack could not justify such alleged actions.
Pretoria has lodged an urgent appeal at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to force Israel to “immediately suspend” its military operations in Gaza.
Israel has dismissed the case as “atrocious” and “preposterous” and vowed to set out a robust defence tomorrow.
Irish lawyer Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh on the team advising South Africa on its case against Israel.
Speaking at the case being heard in The Hague this morning, Ní Ghrálaigh said: “The international community continues to fail the Palestinian people, despite the overt dehumanising genocidal rhetoric by Israeli governmental and military officials matched by the Israeli army’s actions on the ground, despite the horror of the genocide against the Palestinian people being livestreamed from Gaza to our mobile phones, computers and television screens.”
She said this is the “first genocide in history where its victims are broadcasting their own destruction in real-time in the desperate and so far vain hope that the world might do something”.
“The world should be absolutely horrified. The world should be absolutely outraged. There is no safe space in Gaza and the world should be ashamed,” Ní Ghrálaigh told the court.

Ní Ghrálaigh recalled to the court the UN secretary general and its officials describing the situation in Gaza “as ‘a crisis of humanity’, ‘a living hell’, ‘a bloodbath’, ‘a situation of utter deepening and unmatched horror where an entire population is besieged and under attack, denied access to the essentials for survival on a massive scale’”.
“As an undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs stated last Friday, ‘Gaza has become a place of death and despair’,” she said.
The Irish lawyer told the hearing that there is an “urgent need” for “provisional measures to protect Palestinians in Gaza against the irreparable prejudice caused by Israel’s violations of the Genocide Convention”.
As a fellow signatory to the treaty, South Africa can take Israel to the ICJ, which rules on disputes between countries and is often described as the World Court.
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has long been a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause, often linking it to its own historic struggle against the white-minority government, which had cooperative relations with Israel.
South Africa has acknowledged the “particular weight of responsibility” of accusing Israel of genocide. It “unequivocally” condemned the Hamas attacks that sparked off the conflict in Gaza.
The court also heard today from Pretoria’s Justice Minister Ronald Lamola.
“No armed attack on a state territory, no matter how serious … can provide justification for or defend breaches of the convention,” he said.
Another lawyer for South Africa, Adila Hassim, said Israel’s bombing campaign is aimed at the “destruction of Palestinian life” and had pushed Palestinians “to the brink of famine”.
“Genocides are never declared in advance, but this court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts,” she said.

Israel President Isaac Herzog has already hinted at his country’s likely defence against what he called an “atrocious and preposterous … claim”.
“We will present proudly our case of using self defence … under international humanitarian law,” he said.
Herzog said the Israeli army was “doing its utmost under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties”.
The United States is backing its ally Israel, with the State Department describing the charges as “unfounded”.
“In fact, it is those who are violently attacking Israel who continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews,” said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.
As it is an urgent procedure, the ICJ could rule in a matter of weeks.
Its rulings are final and cannot be appealed. However, countries do not always follow the court’s verdicts – the ICJ has ordered Russia to stop its invasion of Ukraine, for example.
But a court ruling against Israel would certainly increase political pressure on the country, with many speculating it could serve as a pretext for sanctions.

ISRAEL IS TODAY facing accusations at the UN’s top court that it has committed “genocidal” acts in Gaza, charges the country’s president dismissed as “atrocious” and “preposterous”.
South Africa has lodged an urgent appeal to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to force Israel to “immediately suspend” its military operations in Gaza.
The hearing is taking place current at the Great Hall of Justice in the Peace Palace in The Hague, a world away from the devastation seen in Israel and Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks.
South Africa argues that Israel is breaking its commitments under the UN Genocide Convention, a treaty signed in 1948 as the world cried “never again” after the Holocaust.

In its 84-page submission to the court, Pretoria charged that Israel’s bombing and invasion of Gaza is “intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog has already hit out at the accusations and laid out his country’s likely defence.
“There’s nothing more atrocious and preposterous than this claim,” said Herzog.
“We will be in the International Court of Justice and we will present proudly our case of using self defence… under international humanitarian law,” he said.
He said the Israeli army was “doing its utmost under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties”.
As part of its application to the ICJ, South Africa has requested that the court apply what are called “provisional measures”, i.e. court orders directed at Israel (and other signatories) ahead of the actual trial.
“This is kind of like a preliminary injunction, or what we might call temporary or interim relief, that’s meant to be in place while the case is pending,” explains Michael Becker, a professor of International Human Rights Law at Trinity College.
“So the idea here is that you ask the ICJ to direct the other states to take certain actions or to refrain from engaging in certain conduct in order to protect the rights that are being adjudicated upon in the overall case.”
In detailing its proposed provisional measures, South Africa’s application said:
“The Court should order Israel to cease killing and causing serious mental and bodily harm to Palestinian people in Gaza,” and “cease the deliberate infliction of conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction as a group”.
Additionally, it asked the Court to order Israel “to prevent and punish direct and public incitement to genocide, and to rescind related policies and practices, including regarding the restriction on aid and the issuing of evacuation directives.”

Genocide: South Africa's case against Israel at the International Court of Justice,"AT THE END of December, South Africa submitted an application to the International Court of Justice, the top court of the United Nations, in which it accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza.
South Africa’s 84-page application described Israel’s actions since 7 October as “genocidal in character” and “intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”.
Israel has denied the accusations and said it will defend itself at the Court.
While reaching a final verdict would likely take years,  preliminary hearings of the case are being held this Thursday and Friday at the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands.
South Africa alleges that Israel is in violation of theGenocide Convention of 1948in three ways: by committing acts of genocide, by failing to prevent genocide and by failing to prevent and punish incitement to genocide.
The term ‘genocide’ was coined by Polish lawyer Raphäel Lemkin in 1944 and then codified in the Genocide Convention of 1948, which describes it as a crime “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.
Distinct from the International Criminal Court (ICC), where individuals are prosecuted for war crimes, the ICJ is the venue for settling disputes between states. Any state signatory to the Convention can take a case against any other signatory even if it is not directly affected by the alleged crimes, as is the case for South Africa.
Israel does not recognise the authority of the ICC but it does recognise the ICJ and is a signatory to the Genocide Convention, a document produced in the immediate aftermath of the Nazi Holocaust.
Shortly after the South African application was made, Israeli spokesperson Eylon Levy said:
“The state of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice at The Hague to dispel South Africa’s absurd blood libel. We assure South Africa’s leaders, history will judge you, and it will judge you without mercy.”
South Africa has received support for the case from a number of countries since it submitted the application, including Turkey, Malaysia and Jordan.
Over the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkarruled out joining South Africain its application saying, “that case will be heard” and “I really think this is an area where we need to be very careful.”
Those comments came a day after a group of senators wrote to Varadkar and Tánaiste Micheál Martincalling on the Government to join the case.This week a number ofopposition parties joined the senatorsin making the same call.
The Israeli campaign came in response to the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October, when militants broke through the fence surrounding Gaza and killed civilians as well as military personnel, in an operation that left more than 1,000 people dead, according to the Israeli government.
Israel’s siege, bombardment and subsequent ground invasion of the Gaza Strip has now killed more than 23,000 people and wounded over 59,000, according to the Gazan health ministry.
UN aid chief Martin Griffiths recently described the territory as “uninhabitable”.
What can we expect from this week’s hearing?
As part of its application to the ICJ, South Africa has requested that the court apply what are called “provisional measures”, i.e. court orders directed at Israel (and other signatories) ahead of the actual trial.
“This is kind of like a preliminary injunction, or what we might call temporary or interim relief, that’s meant to be in place while the case is pending,” explains Michael Becker, a professor of International Human Rights Law at Trinity College.
“So the idea here is that you ask the ICJ to direct the other states to take certain actions or to refrain from engaging in certain conduct in order to protect the rights that are being adjudicated upon in the overall case.”
In detailing its proposed provisional measures, South Africa’s application said:
“The Court should order Israel to cease killing and causing serious mental and bodily harm to Palestinian people in Gaza,” and “cease the deliberate infliction of conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction as a group”.
Additionally, it asked the Court to order Israel “to prevent and punish direct and public incitement to genocide, and to rescind related policies and practices, including regarding the restriction on aid and the issuing of evacuation directives.”
While a verdict may be a long way off, a decision on provisional measures could come much sooner than that, Becker says. The Court can also decide to introduce measures of its own, instead of those specifically put forth in the South African application.
In this week’s initial hearing, South Africa will have to convince the ICJ that the Court has jurisdiction over the alleged crimes detailed in the case.

“It’s kind of a preliminary assessment of jurisdiction and that should be no problem here,” says Becker.
More importantly though, “South Africa has to establish that the claims it’s making in the case are plausible. That is, that there is at least a plausible case here of violations of the Genocide Convention, and then that there is a risk of irreparable harm that requires urgent action by the court.”
As to whether the Court will adopt all of South Africa’s proposed measures, Becker believes it is unlikely that it will go as far as to direct Israel to halt all military operations in Gaza.
“I think it’s more likely that the court will direct Israel to ensure that any military operations it is continuing to take in Gaza abide by Israel’s existing obligations under international law. And this would be a way for the court to signal its concern to Israel, that Israel needs to show more restraint in how it’s conducting its operations.”
Whether the Israeli Government would abide by the Court’s orders is another question.
‘Genocidal intent’
After this week’s initial hearings, a long road remains ahead for the South African and Israeli legal teams. Genocide is notoriously difficult to prove, mainly because of a key requirement, the demonstration of genocidal intent.
“Even in situations involving mass atrocities and even situations that might appropriately be characterized as war crimes, or crimes against humanity, those situations don’t necessarily meet the legal definition of genocide,” Becker explains.
“So it isn’t enough to show that Israel has engaged in acts that could be understood as constituting acts of genocide, so the mass killing of Palestinians… you have to also show that those acts were undertaken with the intent to physically destroy the group.
“That’s a very difficult legal standard to actually meet.”
In this case however, there has been a litany of such statements from high-ranking Israeli officials since 7 October thathave been characterised as genocidal.These have come in spite of the official stated Israeli mission to “destroy Hamas”.
They include statements from the Prime Minister, the President and other senior political figures.
For example, on 9 October, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: “We are imposing a complete siege on Gaza. There will be no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel, everything will be closed. We are fighting against human animals and we are acting accordingly.”
On 29 October, Prime Minister Netanyahu quoted a biblical passage about wiping out an entire nation, saying: “Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.”
“It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, it’s absolutely not true,” said President Isaac Herzog on 14 Oct.
“Invest that energy in one thing, erasing all of Gaza from the face of the earth. Gaza needs to be wiped out,” said Galit Distel Atbaryan, Israeli parliament member and former Minister of Information.
Nissim Veturi, Deputy Speaker of the Israeli parliament, said in a tweet that Israel must “do no less than burn Gaza. Who’s left in Gaza? Are there citizens? There are only tunnels, Hamas, and accursed terrorists who murdered children and are holding children hostage. We have to crush Gaza, Gaza is Hamas.”
More recently, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvirexpressed his support for the “voluntary” transfer of Palestinians out of Gazaand said Israeli settlements should be established in the territory, remarks that have drawn rare public criticism from the United States.
In the months since the Israeli siege, bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza began, there have been mounting calls from numerous experts for the campaign to be labelled a genocide.
As early as late October, high-ranking UN official Craig Mokhiberresigned from his positioncalling Israel’s actions in Gaza a “textbook case of genocide”.
In November, a group of UN expertswarned of the possibility of Israel committing genocidein Gaza. Then in December, another group of experts from the UN said thatIsrael was working to expel the civilian population of Gaza.
“That’s going to be a real focal point of the case,” says Becker of the extreme rhetoric coming from Israeli officials.
“And that’s, in some ways, something that distinguishes this case from some other cases that had been brought at the ICJ under the Genocide Convention. But I would say that I think some of those, some not all, but some of those statements and their legal significance will be the subject of fierce legal debate.”
Becker expects the Israeli defence to involve casting such statements as referring to Hamas, rather than the entire Gazan population. Another angle of defence could include attempts to establish some daylight between the statements of officials and the actions of the state during its campaign.
Becker also thinks Israel will likely argue that some of those statements, listed in the South African application, do not officially represent the view of the state and are therefore not legally attributable to it.
“This is a case where there isn’t only, what we might describe as, a kind of ‘pattern of conduct’ evidence, or evidence of what we can see on the ground; Israel’s legal team is going to have to try to explain how those statements by Israeli officials do not, in fact, illustrate the requisite level of intent.”

Antony Blinken meets head of Palestinian Authority as Israel continues to bombard Gaza,"
ISRAEL CONTINUED TO bomb Gaza today as US top diplomat Antony Blinken met the head of the Palestinian Authority and travelled to Bahrain on his Middle East tour aimed at stopping the Israel-Hamas war from escalating.
The Israeli military said it killed dozens of “terrorists” and hit another 150 targets in Gaza, where the health ministry said 147 people had been killed over the previous 24 hours.
The bloodiest ever Gaza conflict started by the unprecedented 7 October Hamas attack on Israel has raged on for more than three months and killed over 23,000 people in the besieged Palestinian territory, according to its health ministry.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas spoke with Blinken of the need “to stop the Israeli aggression against Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank”, which has also been torn by deadly unrest, said the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
Blinken told Abbas that Washington supports “tangible steps” towards the creation of a Palestinian state – a long-term goal which the hard-right Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has opposed.
The US Secretary of State reiterated the US position that a Palestinian state must stand alongside Israel, “with both living in peace and security”, said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.
As Blinken arrived under tight security at Abbas’s headquarters in Ramallah, a group of protesters held up signs that read “Stop the genocide”, “Free Palestine” and “Blinken out”. Some scuffled with Palestinian security forces in riot gear.
Abbas was later set to discuss a “push for an immediate ceasefire” in Gaza in talks with Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in the Red Sea port city of Aqaba.

Blinken later arrived in the Gulf state of Bahrain, home base of the US Fifth Fleet, for talks with King Hamad on preventing a regional escalation of the war, the State Department said.
Since the ongoing Gaza conflict started, fears have grown of a widening conflict between Israel and Iran-backed armed groups, especially Lebanon’s Hezbollah but also groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
Yemen’s Huthi rebels have carried out numerous attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea, and the United States has set up a multinational naval task force to protect the vital commercial artery.
On Tuesday, the rebels “launched a complex” attack, US Central Command said, adding that US and British forces had shot down 18 drones and three missiles, with no casualties or damage reported.
They were downed by a combination of F/A-18 warplanes, operating from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier, three American destroyers and a British naval vessel, CENTCOM said.
The Huthis later said they had fired a “large number” of missiles and drones at a US ship.

British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps warned that “the UK alongside allies have previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and if continued the Huthis will bear the consequences.

“Enough is enough,” he told Sky News. “This has to stop and that is my simple message to them today: Watch this space.”
The ongoing conflict began when Hamas launched its unprecedented 7 October attack, which resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also took around 250 hostages, of whom Israel says 132 remain in Gaza including at least 25 believed to have been killed.
Israel has responded with a relentless military campaign that has killed at least 23,210 people, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
The Israeli army says 186 of its soldiers have been killed inside Gaza.
The United Nations estimates 1.9 million Gazans have been displaced inside the besieged territory that had already endured years of blockade and poverty before the conflict.
Amnesty International said today that there is “no end in sight” to the suffering of Palestinians.
Global concern has flared over Gaza’s humanitarian crisis, and Blinken – while voicing continued US support for top regional ally Israel – has urged steps to reduce the suffering.
Dire shortages brought by an Israeli siege mean the “daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly children, is far too high”, Blinken said on Tuesday after talks with Netanyahu.

Blinken called for “more food, more water, more medicine” for Gaza, where only limited relief supplies have arrived.
Desperate Gazans on Tuesday climbed onto one truck carrying flour and canned goods and tossed the food to the crowd below, AFP footage showed.
Army spokesman Daniel Hagari said Israel is “ready and willing to facilitate as much humanitarian aid as the world will give”.
The war raged on unabated and the army reported more deadly fighting in Gaza’s central Maghazi and southern Khan Younis areas.
Troops had found 15 tunnel shafts as well as rocket launchers, missiles, drones and explosives in Al-Maghazi and destroyed machinery for making rockets that have been fired at Israel, the army said.

One of the many displaced Palestinians, Hassan Kaskin, 55, told AFP: “We have lost our money, our houses, our jobs. We are losing our youths as well.
“We’ve sacrificed our children for our homeland.”
Blinken is on his fourth tour of the Middle East since the outbreak of the conflict, with earlier stops in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Washington has floated a post-conflict scenario in which a reformed Palestinian Authority governs Gaza as well as towns and cities in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967.
Blinken argued that “Israel must be a partner to Palestinian leaders who are willing to lead their people in living side by side in peace with Israel as neighbours”.
Amid a flare-up of violence in the West Bank, Blinken also said that “extremist settler violence carried out with impunity, settlement expansion, demolitions, evictions all make it harder, not easier, for Israel to achieve lasting peace and security”.
He added that “the Palestinian Authority also has a responsibility to reform itself, to improve its governance – issues I plan to raise with president Abbas”.
Netanyahu, who leads what is widely seen as the most right-wing government in Israeli history, has shown no interest in reviving negotiations towards a Palestinian state.
A post-conflict plan outlined by Defence Minister Yoav Gallant envisions local “civil committees” governing Gaza after Israel has dismantled Hamas.
Blinken declined to say whether Netanyahu’s views had shifted in their discussions.
Hamas, an Islamist movement, seized sole control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, ousting Abbas’s Fatah party, with which it had shared power.
The United States and European Union blacklist Hamas as a “terrorist” organisation.
Hamas’s Qatar-based chief Ismail Haniyeh said last week he was “open to the idea” of a single Palestinian administration in Gaza and the West Bank.

Israel army claims two journalists killed in Gaza strike were 'terror operatives',"
ISRAEL’S ARMY HAS claimed that two Al Jazeera journalists it killed in an air strike in Gaza were “terror operatives”.
Hamza Wael Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuria, who also worked as a video stringer for AFP and other news organisations, were killed on Sunday while they were on an assignment for the Qatar-based channel in the city of Rafah.
The army said in a statement yesterday its “intelligence has confirmed that both the deceased were members of Gaza-based terrorist organisations actively involved in attacks against IDF (army) forces”.
“Prior to the strike, the two operated drones, posing an imminent threat to IDF troops,” the army said.
There was no immediate reaction available from the television channel and families of the two men.
When asked yesterday by AFP about what kind of drones were used by the two men and the nature of the threat the drones posed to Israeli troops, the army said it was “checking”.
It said Thuria was identified in a document found by troops in Gaza to be a member of Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade, while Dahdouh was identified as a “terrorist” belonging to Islamic Jihad.
The army statement included a copy of a document it said was a list of “operatives from an electronic engineering unit of the Islamic Jihad, including Dahdouh and his military number”.
Dahdouh and Thuria were killed when the car they were travelling in was hit by two rockets on a street in Rafah, according to witnesses. A third journalist and the driver of the car were wounded.

Thuria, in his 30s, had contributed for AFP since 2019 and had also worked with other international media outlets.
He and Dahdouh had been tasked with filming the aftermath of a strike on a house in Rafah and their car was hit while they were on their way back, AFP correspondents said at the time.
Soon after the strike, Al Jazeera said it “strongly condemns the Israeli occupation forces’ targeting of the Palestinian journalists’ car”, accusing Israel of “targeting” journalists and “violating the principles of freedom of the press”.
In a brief statement, Hamas’s press office said the army’s claims were false and that Israel “creates false pretexts to justify its massacres and crimes against Palestinian civilians and journalists”.
Hamza’s father Wael al-Dahdouh is Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief, and was recently wounded in a strike himself after his wife and two other children were killed in Israeli bombardment in the initial weeks of the war.
On Monday, Wael’s two nephews Ahmed al-Dahdouh and Muhammad al-Dahdouh were also killed in a strike when travelling in a car in Rafah, according to the health ministry in Gaza.
Soon after Dahdouh and Thuria were killed, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that their deaths were an “unimaginable tragedy”.
“And that’s also been the case for … far too many innocent Palestinian men, women and children,” Blinken said.
Blinken is to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo, a day after talks with Palestinian Authority leader Mahmud Abbas.
Abbas ”committed” to reforming the body to potentially reunite Gaza and the occupied West Bank under its leadership after the war, Blinken said.
The conflict in Gaza erupted when Hamas militants stormed across Gaza’s border into Israel in an unprecedented attack on 7 October which left some 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.

Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas, denounced as a terrorist group by the US and EU, and has kept up a relentless bombing of Gaza, which the health ministry says has killed at least 23,357 people, mostly civilians.
Hamas’s press office said this morning that 62 people had been killed in strikes overnight, including around Gaza’s main southern city of Khan Yunis.
Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said in his evening briefing the night before that forces were continuing “to act decisively above and below ground” in the area.
Earlier in the day, the army said that troops east of the city had found “tunnel shafts, tunnel routes, and numerous weapons and materials”, and killed “dozens of terrorists”.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said an Israeli strike on an ambulance in central Gaza killed four medics and two other passengers yesterday.
The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the incident when contacted by AFP.
In Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, people wounded in a strike at a nearby school were brought to the Al-Aqsa hospital.
“There are injured people at the school since last night, no cars or ambulances are reaching it – nothing,” Ramadan Darwit told AFP at the hospital.
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 79 journalists and media professionals, the vast majority Palestinian, have been killed since the conflict began.

Genocide: South Africa's case against Israel at the International Court of Justice,"AT THE END of December, South Africa submitted an application to the International Court of Justice, the top court of the United Nations, in which it accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza.
South Africa’s 84-page application described Israel’s actions since 7 October as “genocidal in character” and “intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”.
Israel has denied the accusations and said it will defend itself at the Court.
While reaching a final verdict would likely take years,  preliminary hearings of the case are being held this Thursday and Friday at the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands.
South Africa alleges that Israel is in violation of theGenocide Convention of 1948in three ways: by committing acts of genocide, by failing to prevent genocide and by failing to prevent and punish incitement to genocide.
The term ‘genocide’ was coined by Polish lawyer Raphäel Lemkin in 1944 and then codified in the Genocide Convention of 1948, which describes it as a crime “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.
Distinct from the International Criminal Court (ICC), where individuals are prosecuted for war crimes, the ICJ is the venue for settling disputes between states. Any state signatory to the Convention can take a case against any other signatory even if it is not directly affected by the alleged crimes, as is the case for South Africa.
Israel does not recognise the authority of the ICC but it does recognise the ICJ and is a signatory to the Genocide Convention, a document produced in the immediate aftermath of the Nazi Holocaust.
Shortly after the South African application was made, Israeli spokesperson Eylon Levy said:
“The state of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice at The Hague to dispel South Africa’s absurd blood libel. We assure South Africa’s leaders, history will judge you, and it will judge you without mercy.”
South Africa has received support for the case from a number of countries since it submitted the application, including Turkey, Malaysia and Jordan.
Over the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkarruled out joining South Africain its application saying, “that case will be heard” and “I really think this is an area where we need to be very careful.”
Those comments came a day after a group of senators wrote to Varadkar and Tánaiste Micheál Martincalling on the Government to join the case.This week a number ofopposition parties joined the senatorsin making the same call.
The Israeli campaign came in response to the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October, when militants broke through the fence surrounding Gaza and killed civilians as well as military personnel, in an operation that left more than 1,000 people dead, according to the Israeli government.
Israel’s siege, bombardment and subsequent ground invasion of the Gaza Strip has now killed more than 23,000 people and wounded over 59,000, according to the Gazan health ministry.
UN aid chief Martin Griffiths recently described the territory as “uninhabitable”.
What can we expect from this week’s hearing?
As part of its application to the ICJ, South Africa has requested that the court apply what are called “provisional measures”, i.e. court orders directed at Israel (and other signatories) ahead of the actual trial.
“This is kind of like a preliminary injunction, or what we might call temporary or interim relief, that’s meant to be in place while the case is pending,” explains Michael Becker, a professor of International Human Rights Law at Trinity College.
“So the idea here is that you ask the ICJ to direct the other states to take certain actions or to refrain from engaging in certain conduct in order to protect the rights that are being adjudicated upon in the overall case.”
In detailing its proposed provisional measures, South Africa’s application said:
“The Court should order Israel to cease killing and causing serious mental and bodily harm to Palestinian people in Gaza,” and “cease the deliberate infliction of conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction as a group”.
Additionally, it asked the Court to order Israel “to prevent and punish direct and public incitement to genocide, and to rescind related policies and practices, including regarding the restriction on aid and the issuing of evacuation directives.”
While a verdict may be a long way off, a decision on provisional measures could come much sooner than that, Becker says. The Court can also decide to introduce measures of its own, instead of those specifically put forth in the South African application.
In this week’s initial hearing, South Africa will have to convince the ICJ that the Court has jurisdiction over the alleged crimes detailed in the case.

“It’s kind of a preliminary assessment of jurisdiction and that should be no problem here,” says Becker.
More importantly though, “South Africa has to establish that the claims it’s making in the case are plausible. That is, that there is at least a plausible case here of violations of the Genocide Convention, and then that there is a risk of irreparable harm that requires urgent action by the court.”
As to whether the Court will adopt all of South Africa’s proposed measures, Becker believes it is unlikely that it will go as far as to direct Israel to halt all military operations in Gaza.
“I think it’s more likely that the court will direct Israel to ensure that any military operations it is continuing to take in Gaza abide by Israel’s existing obligations under international law. And this would be a way for the court to signal its concern to Israel, that Israel needs to show more restraint in how it’s conducting its operations.”
Whether the Israeli Government would abide by the Court’s orders is another question.
‘Genocidal intent’
After this week’s initial hearings, a long road remains ahead for the South African and Israeli legal teams. Genocide is notoriously difficult to prove, mainly because of a key requirement, the demonstration of genocidal intent.
“Even in situations involving mass atrocities and even situations that might appropriately be characterized as war crimes, or crimes against humanity, those situations don’t necessarily meet the legal definition of genocide,” Becker explains.
“So it isn’t enough to show that Israel has engaged in acts that could be understood as constituting acts of genocide, so the mass killing of Palestinians… you have to also show that those acts were undertaken with the intent to physically destroy the group.
“That’s a very difficult legal standard to actually meet.”
In this case however, there has been a litany of such statements from high-ranking Israeli officials since 7 October thathave been characterised as genocidal.These have come in spite of the official stated Israeli mission to “destroy Hamas”.
They include statements from the Prime Minister, the President and other senior political figures.
For example, on 9 October, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: “We are imposing a complete siege on Gaza. There will be no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel, everything will be closed. We are fighting against human animals and we are acting accordingly.”
On 29 October, Prime Minister Netanyahu quoted a biblical passage about wiping out an entire nation, saying: “Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.”
“It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, it’s absolutely not true,” said President Isaac Herzog on 14 Oct.
“Invest that energy in one thing, erasing all of Gaza from the face of the earth. Gaza needs to be wiped out,” said Galit Distel Atbaryan, Israeli parliament member and former Minister of Information.
Nissim Veturi, Deputy Speaker of the Israeli parliament, said in a tweet that Israel must “do no less than burn Gaza. Who’s left in Gaza? Are there citizens?

"Israel agrees for UN mission to assess north Gaza situation, says Blinken","LAST UPDATE|9 Jan

US TOP DIPLOMAT Antony Blinken has said that Israel has agreed on a plan for a UN mission to assess the situation in war-torn northern Gaza to enable the safe return of displaced Palestinians.
Blinken is on his fourth round of Middle East crisis diplomacy since the conflict broke out.
“As Israel’s campaign moves to a lower intensity phase in northern Gaza and as the IDF (Israel army) scales down its forces there, we agreed today on a plan for the UN to carry out an assessment mission,” Blinken said during a visit to Israel.
“It will determine what needs to be done to allow displaced Palestinians to return safely to the north.”
During his visit, he also urged Israel to “avoid further civilian harm” in the besieged Palestinian territory.
In a Tel Aviv meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the secretary of state reaffirmed US “support for Israel’s right to prevent the terrorist attacks of 7 October from being repeated”, said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.
But Blinken also “stressed the importance of avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian infrastructure in Gaza”, said Miller about territory where more than 23,000 people have died in the conflict, local health officials say.
For the longer term, Miller said, Blinken “reiterated the need to ensure lasting, sustainable peace for Israel and the region, including by the realisation of a Palestinian state”.
An AFP correspondent reported intense strikes overnight in Khan Yunis and Rafah, the biggest cities in the south of Gaza which are crowded with internally displaced people.
The army said its forces had killed 40 militants over the past 24 hours in “expanded ground operations including air strikes” in Khan Yunis, and that troops had seized AK-47 assault rifles, rocket launchers and other weapons.
The Gaza conflict broke out after Hamas gunmen launched their 7 October attack that resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.

Militants of Hamas, considered a “terrorist” group by the United States and European Union, also took around 250 hostages. Israel says 132 of them remain captive, including at least 25 believed to have been killed.
Israel has responded with relentless bombardment and a ground invasion of Gaza that have killed at least 23,210 people, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
The Israeli army says its death toll inside Gaza had risen to 185 after nine soldiers were killed yesterday.
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, speaking in Qatar today, argued that the 7 October attack “came after an attempt to marginalise the Palestinian cause”.
He charged that, “despite the heavy price, the massacres and the war of genocide, it (Israel) failed to achieve any of its goals”.
In further comments, released later by Hamas in Gaza, he called on Muslim states “to support the resistance with weapons, because this is … not the battle of the Palestinian people alone”.
The conflict has displaced most of Gaza’s 2.4 million people, and the United Nations says many are at risk of famine and disease.
With only minimal aid entering Gaza, Israeli human rights group B’Tselem charged that “everyone in Gaza is going hungry” as the “direct results of Israel’s declared policy”.
Since the conflict started, fears have also grown of an escalating conflict between Israel and its other regional enemies, a loose alliance of Iran-backed armed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
Israel has traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah for three months and more recently killed senior operatives of the Shiite Muslim militant group as well as of Hamas on Lebanese soil.
Hezbollah said today it had launched a drone attack on Israel’s “northern command centre” in Safed as part of its response to the killings of Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri and Hezbollah field commander Wissam Tawil.
The Israeli army confirmed that a “hostile aircraft” had come down at one of its bases in the north and said that “no injuries or damage were reported”.
The Israeli army also said yesterday it had killed a “central” Hamas figure in Syria, Hassan Akasha, who had led “terrorist cells which fired rockets … toward Israeli territory”.

Blinken also voiced hope that, after the conflict, Israel could push on with its efforts towards regional integration, following its US-brokered normalisation deals with the United Arab Emirates and other states.
“I think there actually are real opportunities there, but we have to get through this very challenging moment,” Blinken said after meeting Foreign Minister Israel Katz on the latest leg of a tour that has already taken him to Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

As the ground offensive continues, the Israeli army has claimed to have largely achieved military control over northern Gaza, and said that the war is now entering a new phase.
Army spokesman Daniel Hagari, speaking to The New York Times, said the next phase would involve fewer soldiers and air strikes and that a troop reduction had already begun this month.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking in Cairo, also stressed the need for “less intensive” combat and greater aid flows, while reiterating Berlin’s solid support for Israel.
Her Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry voiced fears about the displacement of Palestinians and said “two million citizens cannot remain trapped in one spot in the south in this way”.
Baerbock stressed that “we will not accept displacement. We will not accept it in the West Bank, we will not accept it in Gaza”.
Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli police confirmed three people were killed yesterday during a raid on Tulkarem to arrest a “wanted terrorist”.
Israeli army raids and settler attacks in the West Bank have killed at least 333 people since 7 October, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry.
Palestinian officials accused Israel of a “brutal crime” after footage shared on social media appeared to show a military vehicle running over a dead militant in Tulkarem, an incident the officials said summed up a “culture of hatred” fostered by Israeli forces.

"Sinn Féin, Labour, PBP and SocDems call on Govt to join genocide case against Israel in ICJ","OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE called on the government to join South Africa’s genocide filing against Israel at the United Nation’s International Court of Justice (ICJ).
Senior politicians from Sinn Féin, Labour, Social Democrats and People Before Profit joined with Independent Senator Frances Black and the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC) today to make the call.
At a press conference in Dublin, Sinn Féin’s foreign affairs spokesperson Matt Carthy said it is his party’s view that it is unacceptable that Ireland has refused to join the case.
Last week, South Africa submitted a case to the UN’s top courtaccusing Israel of committing genocideagainst Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israel has rejected the accusation and said it will defend itself at the Court.
The first hearing in the case is set to take place this week in the Hague in the Netherlands.
On Sunday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkarruled outjoining the case after he andTánaiste Micheál Martin receiveda letter from four senators that called on the Government to support it.
Varadkar said he believes it is an area where “we need to be very careful”.
Speaking at today’s press conference, IPSC vice chair Fatin Al Tamimi said she was disappointed by the Taoiseach’s remarks.
“10,000 children were murdered by Israel and our government still and the international community hasn’t done anything to stop it,” Al Tamini said.
She called on people to join the national demonstration organised on Saturday to demand a ceasefire and demand that the Irish government take action.
Matt Carthy said the government’s position “smacks of double standards”.
Carthy said these double standards have been all too evident since the war in Gaza began and pointed to the fact Ireland and other governments made a referral against Russia for its actions in Ukraine, but now refuse to make a referral against Israel.

“Russian aggression against Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of over 10,000 civilians, including 560 children, from a pre-war Ukrainian population of 43 million people within 20 months, and Russia must be held to account for its brutality.
“But Israeli aggression in Gaza has resulted in the killing of almost 23,000 civilians, including almost 10,000 children from a population of just 2.27 million in only three months. And therefore Israel must be held to account on the Israeli aggression,” Carthy said.
Meanwhile Independent Senator Frances Black and People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett both accused the government of inaction because of deference to Washington and Brussels.
Black said: “There is no credible or legal or moral argument of not joining with South Africa at the ICJ. The government is making a shameful political calculation out of deference to Washington and Brussels, and Ireland needs to act decisively and comprehensively to ensure that we live up to our obligations under the Genocide Convention.”
Boyd Barrett said he believes Ireland’s “consistent failure to act under the Genocide Convention as they are obliged to or to take any measures to sanction Israel is because they don’t want to embarrass their counterparts in the European Union or the United States for their complicity in continuing to support Israel’s genocide.”
Social Democrats foreign affairs spokesperson Gary Gannon asked “At what point do we say ‘okay, now it is a genocide?’”.
“How many people have to die? How many more children have to be buried under the rubble before the Irish state, or those who consider themselves to be statesmen either in Ireland, throughout Europe or in the US to then turn around and say, well, that constitutes genocide,” Gannon said.
He referred to comments made at the weekend by the Taoiseach about the genocide in Armenia and said: “to have the audacity to bring up the Armenian Genocide in the same interview, does history not demonstrate what happens when you call a genocide after the fact?”.
Gannon also referred to the Taoiseach’s stated desire to act multilaterally on action against Israel and said: “I haven’t heard anything more cowardice in my own political life of the fear to act unilaterally – why not?
Labour leader Ivana Bacik added that the action taken by South Africa is not a symbolic one.
“South Africans has filed a very, very clear, over 80 page dossier documenting how they say Israel is committing genocide.
“So the case is made very clear and international lawyers are very strongly of the belief that there’s a very strong case there, but it’s not just about that definition of genocide,” she said.
Bacik made the point that in order to address the real suffering of the people of Gaza, South Africa has called for provisional measures to be ordered by the ICJ which could be done “very swiftly” and would effectively see a ceasefire put in place.
Bacik noted that the provisional ruling could be issued by the ICJ in a matter of weeks.

Blinken arrives in Israel as UN calls for investigation into number of journalists killed in Gaza,"LAST UPDATE|8 Jan

US SECRETARY OF State Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv as part of a regional tour seeking to avert regional escalation as Israel pounded Gaza and Lebanon’s Hezbollah said an Israeli strike killed a top commander.
Palestinian militants reported fierce ground combat in southern Gaza, where Israel says its focus has shifted along with the territory’s centre three months into its war with Hamas.
Sirens sounded today in central and southern Israel to warn of incoming rocket fire, and while battles raged in the besieged Gaza Strip, the situation to Israel’s north has also caused increasing regional and global concern.
Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, have engaged in regular cross-border fire during the ongoing conflict since Hamas’s attack against Israel on 7 October.
Today, Hezbollah announced the killing of a “commander” for the first time since October, naming him as Wissam Hassan Tawil.
A security official in Lebanon, requesting anonymity for security reasons, said Tawil “had a leading role in managing Hezbollah’s operations in the south”, and was killed there by an Israeli strike targeting his car.
The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah “military sites” in Lebanon today, but did not immediately comment on Tawil’s death.
His is the second high-profile killing in Lebanon this month, following a strike in a Beirut stronghold of Hezbollah last week which killed Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri, heightening fears of the conflict spreading.

The Israeli army also said it had killed a “central figure” in Syria responsible for Hamas rocket attacks, naming him as Hassan Akasha.
The 7 October attack by Hamas resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Hamas, considered a “terrorist” group by the United States and the European Union, also took around 250 hostages, 132 of whom remain captive, Israel says. At least 25 are believed to have been killed.
Israel has responded with relentless bombardment and a ground invasion.
Today, the health ministry in Gaza said that at least 23,084 people have been killed in the besieged Palestinian territory since 7 October.
The ministry said in a statement that it had recorded 249 deaths in the past 24 hours, while a total of 58,926 people had been wounded in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing conflict.
Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian health ministry reported three deaths by Israeli fire today.
Israeli police confirmed three were killed during a raid on Tulkarem, in the northern West Bank, to arrest a “wanted terrorist”.

Israeli forces and settler attacks in the West Bank since 7 October have killed at least 333 Palestinians, according to the Ramallah-based health ministry.
US Secretary of State Blinken, on his fourth regional trip since the current conflict began, met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman today after talks in the United Arab Emirates and ahead of his visit to Israel.

Before leaving Al Ula in Saudi Arabia, Blinken said: “We agreed to work together and coordinate our efforts to help Gaza stabilise and recover… and to work toward long term peace and security and stability.”
Washington, Israel’s main ally and arms supplier, has grown increasingly concerned over the conflict’s civilian death toll.
Speaking today, US President Joe Biden said he was working to get Israel to cut its military presence in Gaza, after protesters calling for a ceasefire disrupted him during a campaign speech.
“I’ve been quietly working with the Israeli government to get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza,” Biden said.
The Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of militant group Islamic Jihad, reported “fierce clashes” today, involving machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, with Israeli troops in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
Islamic Jihad, which has fought alongside Hamas in Gaza, later released a video it claimed showed an Israeli hostage alive in its custody.
Israel’s military reported its forces have “been working in recent days to expand” operations around Khan Yunis and said troops and warplanes struck 30 “significant” targets in the major city overnight.
The fighting, now in its fourth month, has reduced swathes of the narrow Palestinian territory to rubble, and prompted international concern over dire humanitarian conditions.
Earlier today, the United Nations said it was “very concerned by the high death toll of media workers” in the territory.
Palestinians check the car in which two journalists were killed in an Israeli strikeAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
It came a day after Qatar-based Al Jazeera network said an Israeli strike had killed two of its journalists.
The broadcaster said the two journalists were killed when their car was struck in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah, near the border with Egypt, in what it claimed was an Israeli “targeted killing”.
They were named as Mustafa Thuria, a video stringer who also worked for AFP and other media organisations, and Hamza Wael Dahdouh, the son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief who had earlier lost his wife and two other children in an Israeli strike.
A third freelance journalist, Hazem Rajab, was seriously injured.
The UN rights office called for the deaths to be “thoroughly and independently investigated”.
International aid groups have said Israeli attacks on one of Gaza’s last functioning hospitals had forced them to evacuate.

The World Health Organization said Sunday it had evacuated more than 600 patients from the Al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza following “troubling reports of increasing hostilities”.
Médecins Sans Frontières said a day earlier it had evacuated its staff from the same hospital after a bullet penetrated a wall in the intensive care unit.
In a statement today, MSF said a shell broke through the wall of one of its shelters this morning, housing over 100 staff and their families in Khan Yunis.

Four people were injured, including the five-year-old daughter of an MSF staff member, who it said is in a “critical condition”. The staff and their families have now moved to another location.
“We are trying to understand what happened. MSF had informed Israeli Forces that this was an MSF shelter. MSF did not receive evacuation orders,” the statement read.
“We condemn this latest attack which shows yet again that no one and nowhere is safe in Gaza.
The Israeli military today showed journalists what a spokesman described as a cluster of weapons factories and tunnels in central Gaza used by Hamas to manufacture rockets.
Soldiers leading a media tour in Bureij said that what looked like cement factories and other industrial facilities were in fact used to make missiles and shells stored in deep shafts.
Elsewhere, Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas was in Cairo today to meet with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt, a mediator in the conflict.
Most of Gaza’s population has been displaced, according to the United Nations, leaving people in overcrowded shelters or tents in the winter chill.
Many have fled to Rafah in Gaza’s far south, where a strike today ripped open a car killing two of Dahdouh’s nephews.
“They say Rafah is safe, but we don’t see it is safe in Rafah. No place is safe,” said Mohammad Hejazy, overlooking the blood-soaked road.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of the risk of famine and disease, with only minimal aid entering the besieged territory.
Israeli rights group B’Tselem today said “everyone in Gaza is going hungry” as “direct results of Israel’s declared policy”.
Washington has said Blinken will press Israel on its compliance with international humanitarian law and ask for “immediate measures” to boost aid to Gaza.

Israeli strike kills Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon,"AN ISRAELI AIR strike has killed an elite Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon, the latest in an escalating exchange along the border that has raised fears over another Middle East conflict evenas the fighting in Gaza exacts a mounting toll on civilians.
The strike on an SUV killed a commander in a secretive Hezbollah force that operates along the border, according to a Lebanese security official.
Hezbollah identified the fighter who was killed as Wissam al-Tawil.
He is the most senior militant in the armed group to have been killed since Hamas’ 7 October attack triggered the ongoing conflict in Gaza and lower-intensity fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which has escalated since an Israeli strike killed a senior Hamas leader in Beirut last week.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is back in the region this week, appears to be trying to head off a wider conflict in the region.

Israel says it has largely wrapped up major operations in northern Gaza and is now focusing on the central region and the southern city of Khan Younis.
In this picture released by Hezbollah Military Media, shows senior Hezbollah commander Wissam Tawil who was killed in Kherbet Selem village, South Lebanon.
Israeli officials have said the fighting will continue for many more months as the army seeks to dismantle Hamas and return scores of hostages taken during the militant group’s 7 October attack.
The offensive has already killed more than 23,000 Palestinians, devastated vast swathes of the Gaza Strip, displaced nearly 85% of its population of 2.3 million and left a quarter of its residents facing starvation.
Medics, patients and displaced people fled from the main Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza as the fighting drew closer, witnesses said on Monday. Losing the facility would be another major blow to a health system shattered by three months of conflict.
Doctors Without Borders and other aid groups withdrew from the hospital in Deir al-Balah in recent days, saying it was too dangerous. That spread panic among people sheltering there, causing many to join the hundreds of thousands who have fled to the south of the besieged territory.
Tens of thousands of people have sought shelter in Gaza’s hospitals, which are also struggling to treat dozens of people wounded each day in Israeli strikes. Only 13 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are even partially functioning, according to the UN humanitarian office.

Omar al-Darawi, an employee at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, said the facility has been struck multiple times in recent days. He said thousands of people left after the aid groups pulled out, and that patients have been concentrated on one floor so the remaining doctors can tend to them more easily.
“We have large numbers of wounded who can’t move,” he said. “They need special care, which is unavailable.”
More dead and wounded arrive each day as Israeli forces advance in central Gaza following heavy air strikes. Gaza’s health ministry said 249 Palestinians have been killed and 510 others were wounded across the territory in the last 24 hours.
World Health Organisation (WHO) staff who visited on Sunday saw “sickening scenes of people of all ages being treated on blood-streaked floors and in chaotic corridors”, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the UN agency, said in a statement.

UN says Gaza is now 'uninhabitable' as Western diplomats make trips to Middle East,"LAST UPDATE|6 Jan

ISRAEL CONTINUED BOMBING southern Gaza today as the UN warned the besieged Palestinian territory has been rendered “uninhabitable” by three months of bombardment, siege and invasion.
The fighting, triggered by the 7 October attacks on southern Israel by Hamas militants, has sent tensions soaring across the region, and shows no signs of abating with the conflict entering its fourth month tomorrow.
Civilians in the Gaza Strip have borne the brunt of the violence amid widespread displacement, destruction and a deepening humanitarian crisis.
The death toll in Gaza now stands at least 22,722 people, most of them women and children, according to the Gazan health ministry.
With swathes of the territory already reduced to rubble, UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said yesterday that “Gaza has simply become uninhabitable”.
AFP correspondents reported Israeli strikes early today on the southern city of Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of people have sought shelter from the fighting having been told it was safe by Israeli forces.
In Khan Younis, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) evacuated its staff and their family members from the area around the Al-Aqsa hospital following “days of artillery fighting in Gaza’ Middle Area”.
“It is with heavy conscience that we have to evacuate while patients, hospital staff and many people seeking safety remain in the hospital premises,” says Carolina Lopez, emergency coordinator at Al-Aqsa hospital.

Yesterday afternoon, “a bullet heavily penetrated a wall in Al-Aqsa hospital’s intensive care unit,” the medical NGO said.
“Over the last couple of days, drone attacks and sniper fire were just a few hundred meters from the hospital,” a spokesperson said.
“The situation became so dangerous that some staff living in the neighbouring areas were not able to leave their houses because of the constant threats of drones and snipers,” said Lopez.
“Patient care was being affected with reduced staff at the hospital.”
“We reiterate that Israel has an obligation under International Humanitarian Law to protect patients and staff who are still working in the only functioning hospital in Gaza’s Middle Area,” Lopez added.
On Israel’s northern border, Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said it has launched its “initial response” to the killing of Hamas’s deputy chief in Beirut, which a US defence official has told AFP was carried out by Israel.
The Iran-backed group said it had targeted the Israeli military’s Meron air control base with 62 missiles, while the Israeli army reported “approximately 40 launches from Lebanon” this morning, with sirens blaring in the Galilee region.
Contacted by AFP, a military spokesperson confirmed the mountaintop base had been targeted but did not say whether it was damaged. No casualties were reported in Israel.
The Hamas-allied Lebanese movement has been trading near-daily fire with Israeli forces since early October and said the barrage was a response to Tuesday’s killing of Saleh al-Aruri in a strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold.
The army said it had struck Hezbollah “military sites” in response.
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said yesterday that Israeli forces were maintaining a “very high state of readiness” along the border with Lebanon following Aruri’s killing, which Israel has not claimed.
In Gaza, Hagari said, the army continues “to fight … in the north, centre and south”.
Palestinian man Abu Mohammed, 60, who fled to Rafah from the central Bureij refugee camp, told AFP that as the fighting nears its fourth month, Gaza’s future appeared “dark and gloomy and very difficult”.

In a statement on Saturday, the health ministry said it had recorded more than 120 deaths over the past 24 hours.
Victims of renewed Israeli bombardment were brought today to the European hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis, where relatives and mourners gathered.
One of them, Mohamed Awad, wept over the body of a 12-year-old boy.

He counted the deaths in his family. “My brother, his wife, his children, his relatives and the brothers of his wife – there are more than 20 martyrs,” Awad, a journalist, told AFP.
Another Palestinian journalist, Akram El-Shafei, has died at the hospital from wounds sustained in Gaza City in November, making him “the 117th journalist… killed by the Israeli occupation during this crazy war”, according to Asser Yassin of the Palestinian Media Forum.
Yassin said Israel “directly targets journalists” but that it “only increases our determination to… convey the suffering and pain” to the world.
Israeli officials have rejected allegations that the army deliberately targets members of the press.
Shafei’s condition had initially improved, said relative Magda El-Shafei, but he “needed treatment” and there was “nothing” available.
“He’s gone,” she told AFP.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says the majority of the Palestinian territory’s 36 hospitals have been put out of action by the fighting, while remaining medical facilities face dire shortages.
A UN team delivered medical supplies to Gaza authorities in Khan Yunis yesterday, and WHO coordinator Sean Casey said it was “the first time we’ve been able to make this delivery in about 10 days.”
The Israeli military has said its ground and air forces had “killed numerous terrorists … and destroyed a number of tunnel shafts” in Khan Yunis over the past 24 hours.
Israel claims Hamas militants hide in a vast underground network as well as among civilians in schools and hospitals.
Hamas – listed as a “terrorist” group by the United States and the European Union – denies charges of using hospitals as shelters for its fighters.
The army said that during “a targeted raid” in Gaza City, now a largely devastated urban combat zone, troops had found military vests “concealed… in a medical clinic”.
A number of Western diplomats are visiting countries in the Middle East today.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken landed in Turkey today at the start of his fourth regional tour since the conflict began.
He will also visit several Arab states before heading to Israel and the occupied West Bank next week, and plans to discuss with Israeli leaders “immediate measures” on aid, according to a State Department spokesman.
Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh called on Blinken to focus his visit on “ending the aggression” and said US support for Israel has enabled “unprecedented massacres and war crimes against our people in Gaza.”
Haniyeh, based in Qatar, added in a video message shared by his office that “the future and stability of our region are closely linked to our Palestinian cause.”
The European Union foreign policy chief has warned against a regional conflict that would involve Lebanon, as border clashes intensified nearly three months into Israel’s war with Hezbollah ally Hamas.
“It is imperative to avoid regional escalation in the Middle East. It is absolutely necessary to avoid Lebanon being dragged into a regional conflict,” Josep Borrell said during a press conference in Beirut with Lebanon’s foreign minister.
“I am sending this message to Israel too: nobody will win from a regional conflict,” he added.
“I think that the war can be prevented, has to be avoided and diplomacy can prevail,” Borrell told reporters.
“Diplomatic channels have to be open to signal that the war is not the only option but it is the worst option,” he said.
France’s foreign minister told her Iranian counterpart today that “Iran and its affiliates” must stop “destabilising acts” that could spark a broader conflict in the Middle East amid the war in Gaza.
During a telephone call with Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Catherine Colonna “delivered a very clear message: the risk of regional conflagration has never been so great; Iran and its affiliates must immediately cease their destabilising acts”, according to a statement on X, formerly Twitter.
“Nobody would win from escalation,” it added.

“That case will be heard,” he said, adding that it will be up to the Court to make its determination.
The Taoiseach said: “I really think this is an area where we need to be very careful.”
Varadkar said that what has been happening in Gaza since Hamas’ 7 October attacks has been “appalling” and that war crimes have “very possibly” been committed by both sides in the conflict.
But he was reluctant to go as far as labelling Israel’s assault on Gaza a genocide.
“Genocide is something very particular,” he said. “It is defined as the deliberate attempt to destroy an entire nation or entire race or to do so in large part.
“And one group of people that has experienced that in the world are Jewish people, the Holocaust, 6 million Jews killed here in Europe and Hitler had a plan to kill many millions more. That is genocide.
“And of course, there have been other examples of genocide such as the Armenian Genocide, and what’s happened to some indigenous people, for example, in the new world. We need to be very careful about genocide in that context.”

Under theUN Genocide Convention, genocide is described as a crime committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or in part.
Finally, Varadkar pointed to the action of Hamas on 7 October, when militants broke through the fences surrounding Gaza and killed over 1,000 people.
“Bear in mind what Hamas did on 7 October. Hamas went into Israel, killed 1400 people… essentially because they were Israelis because they were Jews, because they lived in Israel. Was that not also genocide?” he asked.
The group of Irish senators who sent the letter to the Taoiseach and Tánaiste are not alone in calling for Israel to answer accusations of committing genocide in Gaza, where the death toll has now passed 22,800 people and the UN describes conditions as “uninhabitable”.
In the months since the Israeli siege, bombardment and subsequent ground invasion of Gaza began, there have been mounting calls from numerous experts for the campaign to be labelled a genocide.
A group of UN experts warned of the possibilityback in mid-November.
Israeli Holocaust and genocide historian Raz Segalhas also made that assessment, pointing to the “annihilatory language” of top Israeli officials.
Craig Mokhiber, a director at the United Nations,resigned in late Octobersaying: “Once again we are seeing a genocide unfolding before our eyes and the organization we serve appears powerless to stop it.”
Since South Africa submitted its application to the ICJ, a number of other countries have supported it, including Turkey, Malaysia and Jordan.
The Taoiseach was also asked about the possibility of recognising Palestinian statehood, to which he replied he would rather do so as part of a multilateral effort, rather than as a single state.
“I understand why people would like to see us do it unilaterally. I actually don’t think that would be a successful decision.
“It would be something that would make us feel better about ourselves no doubt and would be denounced in Israel and welcomed in Palestine but forgotten about within a few days,” he said.
Varadkar also reiterated his desire to see a ceasefire in Gaza.

Irish senators call on Government to join South Africa's genocide case against Israel,"MEMBERS OF THE Seanad’s Civil Engagement Group have written a letter to the Taoiseach and Tánaiste asking the Government to join South Africa in charging Israel with genocide through the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
The group includes senators Lynn Ruane, Frances Black, Alice-Mary Higgins and Eileen Flynn.
Senator Black posted the letter on X (formerly Twitter) today saying, “it is not enough to passively call for a ceasefire” and that “Ireland must take action to prevent the slaughter in Gaza”.
Last week, South Africa submitted a case to the UN’s top courtaccusing Israel of committing genocideagainst Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israel has rejected the accusation and said it will defend itself at the Court.
The first hearing in the case is set to take place next week in the Hague in the Netherlands.
“South Africa’s application to the Court presents a rigorous legal argument that Israel has consistently and flagrantly breached international law and specifically the Genocide Convention by its actions in the last number of months,” the senators’ letter said.
The letter quotes directly from the South African application throughout and calls on Ireland to initiate or join in proceedings at the ICJ.
“As a State party to the Convention, Ireland has an obligation to ensure it is being upheld and in this context has a clear and urgent responsibility to initiate proceedings or join in the proceedings initiated by South Africa at the Courts,” the letter said.
“The basis of the Genocide Convention is that genocide represents the most egregious crime against humanity and should not be allowed to happen again and it is clear that the Israeli Government must be held accountable under the Convention.”

The South African case represents the first official, state-level accusation of genocide levelled against Israel since it began its siege, bombardment and subsequent ground invasion of Gaza in the aftermath of Hamas’ deadly 7 October attacks.
Turkey and Malaysia have since announced their support of the South African application.
As early as mid-November,a group of UN expertswas already warning of the possibility of Israel committing genocide, citing statements of intent from high-ranking Israeli officials calling for the total destruction of Gaza and its population.
The death toll in Gaza has now reached at least 22,700 people, according to the Gazan health ministry and the UN has described the territory as “uninhabitable”.
Ahead of the four-month anniversary of the conflict, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza was “more urgent than ever” andwarned of the consequences of violence spreadingthroughout the region.
He also stressed the urgency of the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held in Gaza and “full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access” to the enclave.
“Events across the region in recent days are also a stark reminder of the potential for further escalation,” he said, referring to theIsraeli assassination of a Hamas leaderin Beirut, Lebanon.
“A widening of this conflict would have devastating consequences for the region and for the world.
“The international community simply cannot allow further civilian suffering and deaths. I urge all parties in the region to exercise restraint and avoid escalation.”

RTÉ receives over 600 emails asking it to boycott Eurovision due to Israel’s involvement,"MORE THAN 600 emails have been sent to RTÉ calling on it to boycott the Eurovision due to Israel’s involvement in the song contest.
RTÉ is Ireland’s representative broadcaster at the Eurovision and it has been urged in these emails to “immediately withdraw support and participation in the contest next year, if Israel is permitted to compete”.
Israel was expected, as usual, to take part in the 68th annual contest – but the campaign to launch an Irish boycott gathered pace after official confirmationlast monthof the 37 countries to take part in event in the Swedish city of Malmö in May.
RTÉ still intends on taking part in the competition, a spokesperson confirmed toThe Journalyesterday.
“RTÉ has always approached the event in the spirit in which it was founded – which is a non-political contest designed to unite audiences and bring people together through a shared love of music and entertainment,” the spokesperson said.
They added that RTÉ is not “not aware” of any participating public service broadcaster who is planning to boycott the Eurovision over Israel’s involvement.
The acts hoping to represent Ireland at the Eurovision will be announced next week on The Ray D’Arcy Show on RTÉ Radio 1. The chosen act will be selected in the coming weeks.
The template email being sent to RTÉ claims that Israel’s participation “brings the entire competition into disrepute”.
The petition adds that by “competing alongside Israel, we are supporting the atrocities currently being carried out by Israel in Palestine”.
The email notes that while a “boycott of the competition will not end the brutal violence, it will serve as a symbol of solidarity with the Palestinian people”.
Russian exclusion
The petition also notes that Russia was excluded from the competition due to the invasion of Ukraine after the organisers said not doing sowould “bring the competition into disrepute”.
The Eurovision Song Contest is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
In the immediate aftermath of the 2022 Ukraine invasion, the EBU said it was “monitoring the situation” and that Russia remained in that year’s competition.

However, that decision was reversed within 24 hours.
As EBU boss and former RTÉ Director General Noel Curranexplained in an interviewwithThe Journalat that year’s song contest, “it was pretty clear to us that we wouldn’t be able to have Russia take part”.
The template email being sent to RTÉ as part of the current boycott campaign said this decision “sent a powerful message of solidarity to the citizens of Ukraine and showed the world that Eurovision stands for unity and peace”.
“The people of Palestine deserve to hear that message”, the email added.
No plans to ban Israel
The EBU – which is, essentially, an alliance of public service media organisations whose countries are within the European Broadcasting Area – toldThe Journalthat the Eurovision is “a competition for broadcasters – not governments – and the Israeli public broadcaster has participated in the contest for 50 years”.
“We are a member-led organisation. The governing bodies of the European Broadcasting Union represent the membership.
“These bodies have reviewed the participants list and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN meets all the competition rules and can participate in the Contest next year in Malmö, Sweden, alongside 36 other broadcasters.”
The spokesperson added that the EBU is “aligned with other international organisations that have similarly maintained their inclusive stance towards Israeli participants in major competitions at this time”.
In relation to Russia’s exclusion from the contest, the spokesperson said: “In 2022, following the invasion of Ukraine, the governing bodies of the EBU decided to exclude the Russian broadcaster from the Eurovision Song Contest where they would be competing alongside our Member Suspilne Ukraine.
The conflict in Gaza has been raging for three months.
Israel launched its campaign against Hamas after the militant group’s 7 October attack, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
The militants also took around 250 hostages, 132 of whom remain in captivity, according to Israel, including at least 24 believed to have been killed.
Israel’s relentless bombardment and ground invasion have killed at least 22,600 people, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
Conditions for Gaza’s civilians are precarious, with the United Nations estimating 1.9 million people are displaced.

"Israel's bombing of Gaza continues, as Israel says over 100 targets struck in 24 hours","
THE UNITED NATIONS has warned that Israel’s war against Hamas, which is now approaching its fourth month, has made Gaza near impossible to live in as bombing continued across the territory today.
With much of the Gaza Strip already reduced to rubble, air strikes hit the southern cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah as well as parts of central Gaza, AFP correspondents reported.
The Israeli army said its forces had “struck over 100 targets” across Gaza over the previous 24 hours, including military positions, rocket launch sites and weapons depots.
The health ministry in the Palestinian territory said it had recorded 162 deaths over the same period.
A fighter jet bombed the central area of Bureij overnight, killing “an armed terrorist cell”, the army said, after what it described as an attempted attack on an Israeli tank.
And “a number” of Palestinian militants were killed in clashes in Khan Yunis, a city that has become a major battleground, the army said.
Troops also uncovered tunnels under the Blue Beach Hotel in northern Gaza which had been used “by terrorists as shelter from where they planned and executed attacks”.
Civilian deaths have soared during the conflict and the UN has warned of a humanitarian crisis that has left hundreds of thousands displaced, facing famine and disease.

“Gaza has simply become uninhabitable,” UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said today.
“Its people are witnessing daily threats to their very existence – while the world watches on,” he said in a statement.
The current conflict has been ongoing since the unprecedented attack on Israel launched by Hamas on 7 October, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
The militants also took around 250 hostages, 132 of whom remain in captivity, according to Israel, including at least 24 believed to have been killed.

At a commemorative gathering in southern Israel today, Michael Levi, 41, whose brother Or Levi was kidnapped from a music festival, said “there’s a feeling none of us… can be safe in our own homes” since the attack.
In response, Israel has launched a relentless bombardment and ground invasion that have killed at least 22,600 people, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
AFPTV footage today showed entire families, seeking safety from the violence, arriving in Rafah in overloaded cars and on foot, pushing handcarts stacked with possessions.
“We fled Jabalia camp to Maan (in Khan Yunis) and now we are fleeing from Maan to Rafah,” said one woman who declined to give her name. “(We have) no water, no electricity and no food.”

A spokesman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, told AFP that Rafah is overwhelmed by the influx.
“The city is usually home to only 250,000 persons. And now, it’s more than 1.3 million,” said Adnan Abu Hasna.
Abu Mohammed, 60, who fled to Rafah from Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, said he believed the future of the territory was “dark and gloomy and very difficult”.
The Palestinian Red Crescent reported renewed shelling and drone fire in the area around Al-Amal hospital in Khan Yunis after seven displaced people, including a five-day-old baby, were killed while sheltering in the compound.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant presented Israel’s first plan for the “day after”, which was shared with the media last night but not yet adopted by Israel’s war cabinet.
The minister’s outline proposals say that neither Israel nor Hamas will govern Gaza and rejects future Jewish settlements there.
According to the proposals, the conflict will continue until Israel has dismantled Hamas’s “military and governing capabilities” and secured the return of hostages.
After Israel achieves its objectives – for which the proposal sets no timeline – Palestinian “civil committees” will begin assuming control of the territory’s governance.
The proposals were unveiled on the eve of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s fourth trip to the region since the conflict started.

Blinken arrived in Turkey today on the first leg of a trip that will also take him to Greece and several Arab states before he heads to Israel and the occupied West Bank next week.
During his visit, Blinken plans to discuss with Israeli leaders “immediate measures to increase substantially humanitarian assistance to Gaza”, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.
“We don’t expect every conversation on this trip to be easy. There are obviously tough issues facing the region and difficult choices ahead,” he added.
Germany’s top diplomat Annalena Baerbock will also travel to the region, a foreign ministry spokesman said.
She plans to discuss “the dramatic humanitarian situation in Gaza” and tensions on the Israel-Lebanon border, spokesman Sebastian Fischer said.
The conflict in Gaza and almost daily exchanges of cross-border fire between Israel and Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah group since 7 October have raised fears of a wider conflagration.
A strike on Tuesday in Lebanon, widely assumed to have been carried out by Israel, killed Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri in Hezbollah’s stronghold in the southern suburbs of Beirut.
Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, warned Israel today that the group will swiftly respond “on the battlefield” to the killing.
Israel’s Gallant responded by saying Israel “prefers a diplomatic path over a military one”, though he warned “we are close to the point of the hour glass turning over”.
The military said today its fighter jets had conducted fresh strikes against Hezbollah targets just across the border.
Elsewhere in the region, thousands rallied in support of Gaza in the Yemeni capital Sanaa and the Jordanian capital Amman.

AN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE has flattened a home in an area of southern Gaza that the military had declared a safe zone, as Israeli troops continued their assault in the nearby city of Khan Younis.
Palestinian hospital officials said the blast killed at least 12 people, almost all of them children.
Israel’s offensive has focused on Khan Younis, where the military said today it has uncovered tunnels used by Hamas and was fighting members of the militant group that attacked southern Israel on October 7.
Israel has vowed to continue its campaign in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed. An apparent Israeli strike that killed a top Hamas leader in Beirut has stirred fresh fears that the conflict could expand into other parts of the region.

The call was condemned by the United Nations, as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not officially suggested plans to evict Gazans or to send Jewish settlers back to the territory since the conflict broke out in October.

Funeral of Hamas leader in Beirut as Blinken heads for Middle East amid wider conflict fears,"LAST UPDATE|4 Jan

US SECRETARY OF State Antony Blinken will head to the Middle East today as fears mount that Israel’s assault on Gaza will cause conflict to spread across the region, following deadly blasts in Iran, Iraq and the killing of a Hamas leader in Lebanon.
A US official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the trip – Blinken’s fourth to the region since the start of Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Tensions have surged with Israel’s northern neighbour Lebanon, where a strike in Beirut on Tuesday, widely assumed to have been carried out by Israel, killed Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Aruri, who was buried today.
Aruri was killed in the south Beirut stronghold of the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, which has traded tit-for-tat fire across the border with Israel for months, while both sides have avoided full-scale war.
Hezbollah has vowed that the killing of Aruri and six other Hamas operatives on its home turf will not go unpunished, labelling it “a serious assault on Lebanon… and a dangerous development”.
Thousands of people took to the streets of Beirut today for Aruri’s funeral.
Draped in Palestinian and Hamas flags, Aruri’s coffin and those of two of his comrades were first taken to a Beirut mosque for prayers before being carried to the Palestine Martyrs Cemetery where top Palestinian officials killed by Israel over the last five decades are buried.
The funeral was attended by Palestinian officials, including top Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk, as well as representatives of some Lebanese political groups.

“The enemy is running away from its failures and defeats (in Gaza) to Lebanon,” Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a speech aired during the funeral.
He added that the killing of Arouri in Beirut “is a proof of (Israel’s) bloody mentality”.
In addition, Iraq has accused the US-led coalition of an air strike in Baghdad today that killed a senior commander and another member of a pro-Iranian faction.

Meanwhile, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned Israel against all-out conflict, after Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi, in a visit to the Lebanese border, said troops were “in very high readiness”.
Nasrallah said that “for now, we are fighting on the frontline following meticulous calculations” but warned that, “if the enemy thinks of waging a war on Lebanon, we will fight without restraint, without rules, without limits and without restrictions”.
The Lebanese Shiite Muslim group said today that another four of its fighters were killed overnight, raising its death toll to 129 since the outbreak of border hostilities.
Mossad chief David Barnea warned yesterday that the Israeli spy agency “is committed to settling the score with the murderers” who carried out the Hamas attack.
Anyone who “participated directly or indirectly in the slaughter of October 7, his blood shall be upon his own head,” Barnea said.
The 7 October attack resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Gaza militants also took around 250 hostages, 129 of whom remain in the Palestinian territory according to Israel.
In response, Israel launched a relentless bombardment and ground invasion that has reduced swathes of Gaza to rubble and claimed at least 22,313 lives, according to the health ministry.
The United Nations estimates 1.9 million Gazans are displaced, and the World Health Organization has warned of the risk of famine and disease, with only a minimal amount of aid entering the territory.

As the Israel-Hamas conflict has raged, another regional flashpoint has seen Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels fire at merchant vessels in the Red Sea, disrupting a key global shipping lane, in attacks the rebels say are in solidarity with Hamas.
The United States and 11 of its allies jointly warned the Huthis of unspecified consequences unless they immediately halt the attacks.
US President Joe Biden’s administration described the statement – joined notably by Britain, Germany and Japan – as a final warning as he weighs possible military strikes if attacks persist.
“I would not anticipate another warning,” a senior US official said, calling the message “very clear”.
On Sunday, the US military said it had sunk three Huthi boats following attacks on a container ship of Danish shipping giant Maersk. The rebels said 10 of their fighters were killed.
Regional tensions rose further after twin bomb blasts in Iran yesterday killed 84 people, according to a revised death toll, near the grave of Revolutionary Guards general Qasem Soleimani, who died in a 2020 US strike in Baghdad.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed “evil and criminal enemies of the Iranian nation” and said: “This disaster will have a harsh response, God willing.”
While some Iranian officials pointed blame at Tehran’s long-time arch foes the United States and Israel, Washington rejected suggestions of either nation’s involvement and an Israeli military spokesman declined to comment.
US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller called the idea of US involvement “ridiculous” and said Washington had “no reason to believe that Israel was involved” either.
Miller echoed the fears of many across the Middle East about an expansion of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
“It is in no one’s interest – not in the interest of any country in the region, not in the interest of any country in the world – to see this conflict escalated any further than it already is,” Miller said.

The Israeli military, in its campaign to destroy the Islamist militant group, has reported more strikes in and around Gaza City, now a largely devastated urban combat zone, and Khan Yunis, the biggest urban centre in the besieged territory’s south.
The Gaza health ministry reported “dozens of martyrs and more than 100 wounded in the continued barbaric aerial and artillery bombardment of citizens’ homes in the Gaza Strip”.

Fires sparked by bombing raged in Gaza’s central Deir al-Balah area and the Al-Maghazi refugee camp.
“People were safe in their homes, the house was full of children,” resident Ibrahim al-Ghimri told AFP. ”There were around 30 people. All of a sudden their houses fell on them… What have these children done?”

As the Israel-Hamas conflict has raged, another regional flashpoint has seen Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels fire at merchant vessels in the Red Sea, disrupting a key global shipping lane, in attacks the rebels say are in solidarity with Hamas.
The United States and 11 of its allies jointly warned the Huthis of unspecified consequences unless they immediately halt the attacks.
US President Joe Biden’s administration described the statement – joined notably by Britain, Germany and Japan – as a final warning as he weighs possible military strikes if attacks persist.
“I would not anticipate another warning,” a senior US official said, calling the message “very clear”.
On Sunday, the US military said it had sunk three Huthi boats following attacks on a container ship of Danish shipping giant Maersk. The rebels said 10 of their fighters were killed.
Regional tensions rose further after twin bomb blasts in Iran yesterday killed 84 people, according to a revised death toll, near the grave of Revolutionary Guards general Qasem Soleimani, who died in a 2020 US strike in Baghdad.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed “evil and criminal enemies of the Iranian nation” and said: “This disaster will have a harsh response, God willing.”
While some Iranian officials pointed blame at Tehran’s long-time arch foes the United States and Israel, Washington rejected suggestions of either nation’s involvement and an Israeli military spokesman declined to comment.
US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller called the idea of US involvement “ridiculous” and said Washington had “no reason to believe that Israel was involved” either.
Miller echoed the fears of many across the Middle East about an expansion of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
“It is in no one’s interest – not in the interest of any country in the region, not in the interest of any country in the world – to see this conflict escalated any further than it already is,” Miller said.

At least 103 people killed and 211 wounded in bombings in Iran at ceremony near general's grave,"LAST UPDATE|3 Jan

TWIN BOMB BLASTS killed at least 103 people in Iran today, ripping through a crowd commemorating Revolutionary Guards general Qasem Soleimani four years after his death in a US strike, state media reported.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed “evil and criminal enemies” of the country for the attack and vowed a “harsh response.”
The two explosions – labelled a “terrorist attack” by state media and regional authorities – came amid high Middle East tensions over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the killing of a Hamas senior leader in Lebanon on Tuesday.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “strongly condemns” the unclaimed attacks.
Mohammad Jamshidi, a senior advisor to Iran’s president, blamed Israel and the United States, while the US said it looks like past attacks by ISIS.
“It does look like a terrorist attack, the kind of thing ISIS has done in the past, and that’s our ongoing assumption at the moment,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters.
The blasts, about 15 minutes apart, struck near the Martyrs Cemetery at the Saheb al-Zaman Mosque in Kerman, Soleimani’s southern hometown, as supporters gathered to mark his killing in a 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad.
Cars destroyed in the explosion in Kerman, IranAlamyAlamy
Official IRNA news agency said the number of dead rose to 103 while state television reported 211 wounded, some in critical condition.
Three paramedics who rushed to the scene after the first explosion were among those killed, said Iran’s Red Crescent.
IRNA said the first explosion took place around 700 metres from Soleimani’s grave while the other was around one kilometre away.
President Ebrahim Raisi condemned the “heinous” crime as the Islamic Republic of Iran declared Thursday a national day of mourning.
Tasnim news agency, quoting what it called informed sources, said “two bags carrying bombs went off” and “the perpetrators… apparently detonated the bombs by remote control”.
Online footage showed panicked crowds scrambling to flee as security personnel cordoned off the area.
State television showed bloodied victims lying on the ground and ambulances and rescue personnel racing to help them.
“We were walking towards the cemetery when a car suddenly stopped behind us and a waste bin containing a bomb exploded,” an eyewitness was quoted saying by the ISNA news agency.
“We only heard the explosion and saw people falling.”

By nightfall, crowds returned back the Martyrs Cemetery in Kerman chanting: “Death to Israel” and “Death to America”.
In Tehran, thousands gathered at the Grand Mosalla Mosque to pay tribute to Soleimani.
“We condemn today’s bitter terrorist incident… I hope the perpetrators of the crime will be identified and punished for their actions,” Soleimani’s daughter, Zeinab, said.

Soleimani headed the Quds Force, the foreign operations arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, overseeing military operations across the Middle East.
The twin blasts were denounced by the European Union, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Irad and Jordan.
“The EU condemns in the strongest terms today’s bombing… This act of terror has exacted a shocking toll of civilian deaths and injuries,” an EU statement said.
“The killing of peaceful people visiting the cemetery is shocking in its cruelty and cynicism,” Putin wrote to Raisi and Khamenei.
Iraq – where some 3,000 people gathered in Baghdad Tuesday to commemorate Soleimani – said it was ready to help “to alleviate the impact of this cowardly criminal act”.
The blasts came a day after Hamas number two Saleh al-Aruri — an Iran ally — was killed in a strike, which Lebanese officials blamed on Israel, on a southern Beirut suburb that is a stronghold of Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah.
Wednesday’s bomb blasts were Iran’s deadliest since a 1978 arson Cinema Rex attack in the southwestern city of Abadan, which killed at least 377 people, according to AFP archives.
Iran has long fought a shadow war of killings and sabotage with arch enemy Israel and also battled various jihadist and other militant groups.
In September, the Fars news agency reported that a key “operative” affiliated with the Islamic State group, in charge of carrying out “terrorist operations” in Iran, had been arrested in Kerman.
In July, Iran’s intelligence ministry said it had disbanded a network “linked to Israel’s spy organisation” which had been plotting “terrorist operations” across Iran, IRNA reported.
The alleged plots included “planning an explosion at the grave” of Soleimani, it said.
Soleimani, whom Khamenei years ago declared a “living martyr”, was widely regarded as a hero in Iran for his role in defeating IS in both Iraq and Syria.
Long seen as a deadly adversary by the United States and its allies, Soleimani was one of the most important powerbrokers across the region, setting Iran’s political and military agenda in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Hezbollah leader warns Israel against waging war on Lebanon as fears rise of wider conflict,"LAST UPDATE|3 Jan

HEZBOLLAH CHIEF HASSAN Nasrallah has warned Israel against waging war on Lebanon, a day after a strike blamed on Israel killed Hamas’s number two in the group’s Beirut stronghold.
“If the enemy thinks of waging a war on Lebanon, we will fight without restraint, without rules, without limits and without restrictions,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech.
“We are not afraid of war.”
The Israeli army said earlier that it is “prepared for any scenario” after the Beirut strike.
The attack has stoked fears the conflict in the Gaza Strip could boil over into wider regional conflict.
In the occupied West Bank, where the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported multiple Israeli operations overnight, AFPTV images showed scores of people in the streets of Ramallah to protest at Saleh al-Aruri’s killing.
Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh also condemned the killing, and warned about the “risks and consequences that could follow”, his office said.
Israeli strikes in neighbouring countries on groups acting in support of Hamas have fanned fears of a wider conflict.

In a call with Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz after Aruri’s killing, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Israel to “avoid any escalatory attitude, particularly in Lebanon”.
A strike inside Syria last month that was blamed on Israel killed a senior commander of the foreign operations arm of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
A high-level security official in Lebanon told AFP that Saleh al-Aruri was killed along with his bodyguards in a strike by Israel, which has vowed to destroy Hamas after the movement’s shock 7 October attacks.
A second security official confirmed the information, while Hamas TV also reported Israel had killed Aruri in Lebanon.
Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari did not directly comment on the killing, but said afterwards that the military was in “very high state of readiness in all arenas, in defence and offence”.
“We are highly prepared for any scenario,” he added.

Israel has previously announced the deaths in Gaza of Hamas commanders and officials during the conflict, but Aruri is the most high-profile figure to be killed, and his death came in the first strike on the Lebanese capital since hostilities began.
Hamas said Aruri’s death would not lead to its defeat, while its Lebanon-based ally Hezbollah vowed the killing would not go unpunished, calling it “a serious assault on Lebanon… and a dangerous development”.
Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the killing and said it “aims to draw Lebanon” further into the conflict.

Aruri, who lived in exile, is accused by Israel of masterminding numerous attacks.
Following his death, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said that a movement “whose leaders fall as martyrs for the dignity of our people and our nation will never be defeated”.
After the 7 October, Israel began a relentless bombardment and ground offensive that has killed at least 22,185 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
Hamas’s attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Militants also took around 250 hostages back to Hamas-ruled Gaza, of whom 129 remain in captivity, according to Israeli figures.

Gaza fighting rages as Israel prepares to defend genocide claim,"LAST UPDATE|2 Jan

ISRAELI FORCES CONTINUED to battle Hamas militants amid the ruins of the heavily-bombed Gaza Strip today as the war raging for almost three months piled new miseries on Palestinians in the besieged territory.
The Israeli army said soldiers had killed “dozens of terrorists”, including some carrying explosives, raided a weapons storage compound in the southern city of Khan Yunis and discovered long-range rocket launchers and tunnels.
Hamas-run Gaza’s health ministry said 70 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the past 24 hours during Israeli raids.
In Khan Yunis, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israel twice struck its headquarters, resulting in “five casualties and three injuries” among displaced people who had sought refuge there and at a nearby hospital.
“They told us to go to the south that is safe, but they are liars,” shouted Fathi al-Af, pointing to his daughter on a stretcher on the floor of Nasser Hospital after the Red Crescent strike.
“The entire Gaza Strip is not safe.”
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) denounced the alleged strikes, saying they “severely damaged” a Red Crescent training centre within the Al-Amal hospital.
“Today’s bombardments are unconscionable. Gaza’s health system is already on its knees, with health and aid workers continuously stymied in their efforts to save lives due to the hostilities,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X.
UN agencies have voiced alarm over Gaza’s spiralling humanitarian crisis as around two million people live under siege and bombardment, most of them displaced and many huddling in shelters and tents amid dire food shortages.
“Living conditions… are just hopeless,” said Mostafa Shennar, 43, who fled Gaza City, now a largely devastated urban combat zone, and has been living in the crowded southern border town of Rafah.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and warned the war may continue “throughout 2024″ as efforts toward a ceasefire have so far yielded no results.
The war broke out when Gaza’s rulers Hamas launched an attack on Israel on 7 October which resulted in around 1,140 deaths in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
The Islamist militant group also took around 250 hostages, more than half of whom remain in captivity, according to Israeli figures.
Israel, after suffering the worst attack in its history, has launched a withering offensive that has killed at least 22,185 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.
Genocide claim
Meanwhile, Israeli officials today confirmed that the country will defend itself before the United Nation’s top court against charges that it has engaged in genocide of Palestinians in Gaza – a rare engagement with the world body, which Israel often denounces as biased against it.
South Africa launched the case on Friday at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands, saying the magnitude of death, destruction and humanitarian crisis in Gaza from the Israeli military campaign against Hamas meets the threshold of genocide under international law.

South Africa asked the court to order Israel to halt its attacks in Gaza. Israel dismisses international cases against it as unfair and biased and rarely cooperates.
Its decision to respond to the charge signals that the government is concerned about the potential damage to its reputation.

Eylon Levy, an official in the Israeli prime minister’s office, on Tuesday accused South Africa of “giving political and legal cover” to the 7 October attack by Hamas that triggered Israel’s campaign.
“The state of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice at the Hague to dispel South Africa’s absurd blood libel,” he said.
Army probes prisoner death
The Israeli army said 173 of its soldiers have been killed inside Gaza in the battle against Hamas, which is blacklisted as a terrorist organisation by the European Union and the United States.
The military said today it was investigating a soldier suspected of shooting dead a Palestinian captured in the Gaza Strip.
“The terrorist was handed over to the supervision of a soldier, who, under suspicion, allegedly shot him, resulting in his death,” the army said of Sunday’s incident.
Throughout its bloodiest ever Gaza war, Israel has had the backing of its key ally the United States, which has however also urged greater restraint to spare civilian lives.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, which includes far-right and hardline nationalist groups, has said repeatedly it will keep fighting until Hamas is destroyed.
As 2024 started, a long-running political dispute flared again after setting off mass street protests last year against what is considered the most right-wing government in Israeli history.
The Supreme Court overruled a key plank of a judicial reform package that Netanyahu has defended as rebalancing the powers of politicians and judges, but which protesters have labelled a threat to Israel’s liberal democracy.
The setback on the so-called reasonableness clause dealt a political blow to the wartime government already under fire over the intelligence failure leading up to 7 October.
Some reservists to go home
The army said on Monday it would soon rotate out some of the more than 300,000 reservists called up after 7 October, in part to prepare them for many more months of war ahead.
It said reservists from two brigades, which have some 4,000 troops each, will start returning home this week.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant also said some residents “will soon be able to return home” to towns and villages near Gaza that were attacked by Hamas and then evacuated.
The government has so far refused to specify its plans for post-war Gaza and how it will be rebuilt and governed.

US news outlet Axios, citing unnamed Israeli sources, said Hamas had presented Israel with a proposal on Sunday for a new hostage exchange deal via Qatari and Egyptian mediators.
The official told Axios the proposal had been deemed unacceptable by the Israeli war cabinet, but suggested progress could be made towards a more amenable plan in future.
Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh today said that hostages abducted from Israel will only be freed from Gaza under conditions set by the militant group.
“The enemy’s prisoners will only be released on terms set by the resistance,” Haniyeh said in a televised address.
Turkey arrests ‘Mossad suspects’
Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank, where at least 321 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops and settlers since the Gaza war began, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry.
In the latest clash today, Israeli forces killed four Palestinians, the ministry said. The army said it had shot dead four militants in a “counter-terrorism” operation.
Separately, troops “neutralised” a Palestinian militant who fired at them in the town of Qalqilya, the army said without elaborating.
Recent months have also seen almost daily exchanges of fire on the border with Lebanon between the army and Iran-backed groups, particularly Hezbollah.
Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have also launched attacks at Israel and at cargo ships in the Red Sea, where the US military has assembled a multinational taskforce to protect the vital shipping lane.
The Pentagon said on Monday it would withdraw the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford which has been deployed near Lebanon since shortly after the outbreak of the war.
But it vowed to “retain extensive capability” in the wider region, including the carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower, “to deter any state or non-state actor from escalating this crisis beyond Gaza”.
Turkey, whose President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has harshly criticised Netanyahu over the war, announced the detention of 33 people suspected of working for Israel’s Mossad intelligence service.
Erdogan weeks ago warned of “serious consequences” should Israel attempt to target Hamas figures living or working in Turkey.
“There is an insidious operation and sabotage attempts being made against Turkey and its interests,” Erdogan said, warning that “we will definitely destroy this game”.

Second Israeli minister calls for return of settlers to Gaza,"
AN ISRAELI MINISTER has today called for the return of Jewish settlers to Gaza and said Palestinians should be encouraged to emigrate, a day after similar remarks by another far-right politician.
“We must promote a solution to encourage the emigration of Gaza’s residents,” Israel’s firebrand National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said as war with the Gaza Strip’s Hamas rulers rages on.
Israel unilaterally withdrew the last of its troops and settlers in 2005, ending a presence inside Gaza that began in 1967 but maintaining near complete control over the territory’s borders.
The government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not officially suggested it has any plans to evict Gazans or to send Jewish settlers back to the territory since the current war broke out on October 7.
But Ben Gvir argued that the departure of Palestinians and re-establishment of Israeli settlements “is a correct, just, moral and humane solution”.
“This is an opportunity to develop a project to encourage Gaza’s residents to emigrate to countries around the world,” he told a meeting of his ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit, or “Jewish Power”, party.
Hamas dismissed Ben Gvir’s proposal as a “daydream”.

“You will not find a way to implement it in the face of our resilient, steadfast Palestinian people and their heroic resistance,” the Islamist group said in a statement.
Ben Gvir’s comment came the day after far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also called for the return of settlers to Gaza, equally saying Israel should “encourage” the territory’s approximately 2.4 million Palestinians to leave.
Smotrich said that for Israel to “control the territory militarily for a long time, we need a civilian presence”.
Both Ben Gvir and Smotrich live in settlements in the occupied West Bank, considered illegal under international law.
Hamas on Sunday had also condemned Smotrich’s comments as a “vile mockery and a war crime”.
The October 7 Hamas attack left about 1,140 people dead in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Israel’s ongoing offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas, has killed at least 21,978 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
With heavy combat raging on, 85 percent of people in the besieged Gaza Strip have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations.

UK willing to take 'direct action' over Red Sea attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen,"
BRITISH DEFENCE SECRETARY Grant Shapps today said Britain is “willing to take direct action” against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen who have repeatedly attacked vessels in the Red Sea.
London’s warning comes amid escalating tensions in the vital shipping lane, with US Navy helicopters yesterday firing on Houthi rebels who attempted to board a cargo ship.
The rebels, who seized Yemen’s capital Sanaa in 2014 and control much of country including its Red Sea coastline, have reported 10 fighters dead or missing.
The Houthis –who say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza– have repeatedly fired drones and missiles at passing ships in the seaway through which 12 percent of global trade passes.
Hours after the latest incident, Shapps said Britain could step up its own military interventions. A British destroyer shot down a suspected Houthi attack drone in the Red Sea in mid-December.
“We are willing to take direct action, and we won’t hesitate to take further action to deter threats to freedom of navigation in the Red Sea,” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.

The Houthis “should be under no misunderstanding: we are committed to holding malign actors accountable for unlawful seizures and attacks”.
Shapps described the situation in the region as “a test for the international community” which had implications for other potentially contested waterways around the world.
“If we do not protect the Red Sea, it risks emboldening those looking to threaten elsewhere including in the South China Sea and Crimea,” he added.
“We need to stand firm with our allies, stand firm for our beliefs and stand firm for innocent people caught up in these events.”
The Telegraph said London is drawing up plans with Washington for potential military strikes against the Houthis, and reported that a joint statement giving the rebels a final warning to stop their attacks was imminent.
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said yesterday he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian about the Red Sea tensions.
“I made clear that Iran shares responsibility for preventing these attacks,” he said on social media, noting Tehran’s “long-standing support” for the Houthis.

"Israel warns Gaza war will continue throughout 2024, as overnight strikes kill more than 20","LAST UPDATE|1 Jan

ISRAEL WARNED ITS war against Hamas will continue throughout 2024 as unrelenting strikes killed two dozen people in Gaza and the Palestinian militant group fired a rocket barrage at the stroke of midnight.
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a New Year’s message that some of the 300,000 army reservists would get a break from the war, in order to prepare for the “prolonged fighting” ahead.
The army “must plan ahead, understanding that we will be required for additional tasks and warfare throughout this year,” Hagari said as the conflict sparked by the 7 October Hamas attacks raged on.
Heavy artillery fire again pounded targets in Hamas-run Gaza, killing at least 24 people, health ministry officials there said, with attacks reported across the length of the territory.
In the besieged Gaza Strip, where the UN says 85 percent of the population has been displaced, 20-year-old Hamdan Abu Arab said he hoped “2024 will be better”.
“We used to go out and enjoy our time on the last day of the year,” he recalled. “But this New Year’s Eve, there are only missiles and the remains of people.”
Hamas marked the start of the year by firing a rocket barrage at Israel in what it called a “response to the massacres of civilians”.
AFP journalists in Tel Aviv witnessed missile defence systems intercept rockets overhead as some revellers ran for cover and others kept up the party with a shrug.
“My heart was pounding,” said one, Gabriel Zemelman, 26, shortly after the rocket fire. ”It’s terrifying. You just saw the life we live, it’s crazy.”
The bloodiest ever Gaza war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October attacks on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
The militants also took around 250 people hostage that day, more than half of whom remain in Gaza, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and launched a punishing offensive that has reduced vast areas of Gaza to a ruined wasteland and killed at least 21,822 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.
The Israeli army says 172 of its soldiers have been killed inside Gaza in the battle against the Islamist militant group which Israel, the United States and European Union have designated a “terrorist” organisation.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Saturday that the fighting would last “many months until Hamas is eliminated and the hostages are returned”.
Hagari said “we are also currently adapting the planning of the force deployment in Gaza and the reserve system. Some of the reservists will return to their families and employment this week.
“This will significantly ease the burden on the economy and allow them to gather strength for the upcoming activities in the next year, as the fighting will continue and they will still be required.”

Since Israel imposed a siege at the outset of the war, Gazans have been facing dire shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine.
UN chief Antonio Guterres has condemned the “epic human suffering” and “collective punishment” of Palestinian civilians, while the WHO has warned of the risk of hunger and infectious disease.
“We are exhausted… We were displaced five times during this war,” said 29-year-old Bassam Hana.
“We hope things improve in 2024 and that we live just like any other human being. Currently, we live like animals.”
At least 48 Palestinians were killed in strikes on Gaza City over the weekend, the territory’s health ministry said, with many still buried under the rubble.
“After the explosion we arrived at the scene of the strike and saw martyrs everywhere,” said one resident after a building was hit. ”Children are still missing, we can’t find them.”
Hagari, in a briefing yesterday, said several militants “were killed and subdued during the battles in Khan Yunis”, the main southern city, earlier in the day.
“We are continuing to handle the underground tunnels and to strike the rocket launching array, in order to reduce rocket fire into the State of Israel,” he said, adding that “dozens of aircrafts are in the skies of Gaza at any given moment”.
International mediators have continued efforts toward a new pause in fighting.
A Hamas delegation from Qatar visited Cairo on Friday to discuss an Egyptian three-phase plan proposing renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately an end to the war, sources close to Hamas said.
Their allies Islamic Jihad said on Saturday that Palestinian factions were evaluating the proposal and would give a response “within days”.
The war in Gaza has raised fears of a broader regional conflict, with hostilities flaring with mostly Iran-backed militant groups in nearby countries who say they are acting in support of Hamas.
The Israeli army announced last night having intercepted two “hostile aircraft” launched from Syria towards northern Israel.
Earlier it had reported launches toward Israeli territory from Lebanon, where it has fought the Hezbollah militant group.
“Throughout the day, IDF (military) tanks and helicopters targeted three terrorist squads operating in Lebanon,” the army said in a statement.
And in the Red Sea, the US military said yesterday that Navy helicopters had fired at Iran-backed Huthi rebel boats off Yemen that were attacking a cargo ship, with Yemeni sources reporting 10 rebels killed.

Deputy head of Hamas killed in Israeli strike in Beirut,"LAST UPDATE|2 Jan
HAMAS’ TELEVISION STATION has reported that the deputy head of the militant group, Saleh al-Aruri, has been killed in a strike by Israel in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
Al-Aruri was killed in a “treacherous Zionist strike”, Hamas said on its official channel. The station said the strike was a targeted assassination.
A high-level security official in Beirut told AFP that Al-Aruri was killed in the Israeli strike along with his bodyguards in the Lebanese capital’s southern suburbs, which is a stronghold of Hamas ally Hezbollah.
A second security official confirmed the information, adding two floors of the targeted building and one car were damaged.
Lebanese state media reported the strike hit a Hamas office in Beirut’s southern suburbs, a stronghold of Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.
Hamas TV also said Israel had killed al-Aruri in Beirut. And Lebanese media said a total of six people were killed in the strike.
Hamas has since vowed that the killing of the group’s deputy in Lebanon will not “undermine the continued brave resistance” in Gaza where the Palestinian militant group is battling Israeli forces.
“It proves once more the utter failure of the enemy to achieve any of its aggressive goals in the Gaza Strip,” senior Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq said in a statement.
Al-Aruri was one of the founders of Hamas’s military wing and had headed the group’s presence in the West Bank. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had threatened to kill him even before the Hamas-Israel war began on 7 October.
Israeli parliamentarian and former UN representativeDanny Danon posted on X, formerly Twitter, congratulating the Israeli Defence Forces and other security and intelligence agencies “for killing senior Hamas official Saleh al-Aruri in Beirut”.
Posting in Hebrew, Dannon said that the country will continue to find those in Hamas behind the planning and execution of the 7 October attacks, which killed more than 1,200 Israeli citizens.

However, Lebanon’s prime minister has immediately condemned the killing of al-Aruri, saying the attack “aims to draw Lebanon” further into the Israel-Hamas war.
“Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the explosion in the southern suburbs of Beirut that killed and injured many,” his office said in a statement.
The attack “aims to draw Lebanon into a new phase of confrontations” with Israel, at a time when Hamas ally Hezbollah has been exchanging daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces in southern Lebanon.
Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah group warned that Israel’s killing Tuesday of the deputy Hamas leader in a Beirut suburb they control “will not go unanswered or unpunished”.
Hezbollah called it “a serious assault on Lebanon”.
“We, Hezbollah, affirm that this crime will not go unanswered or unpunished,” the movement said in a statement that called it “a serious assault on Lebanon… and a dangerous development in the course of the war,” the statement added.
Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari did not directly comment on Aruri’s killing but said the military is “highly prepared for any scenario” in its aftermath.
Earlier, Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA) reported that Israel had launched a drone strike which struck an office, believed to be owned by Hamas, in Beirut’s southern suburbs, killing four people.
The explosion shook Musharafieh, one of the Lebanese capital’s southern suburbs, which are a stronghold of the militant Hezbollah group, an ally of Hamas. It caused a fire in Hadi Nasrallah Street south of Beirut.
Videos circulating on social media showed serious damage and fire.
Earlier today, Hezbollah said its fighters carried out several attacks along the Lebanon-Israel border targeting Israeli military posts.

Second Israeli minister calls for return of settlers to Gaza,"
AN ISRAELI MINISTER has today called for the return of Jewish settlers to Gaza and said Palestinians should be encouraged to emigrate, a day after similar remarks by another far-right politician.
“We must promote a solution to encourage the emigration of Gaza’s residents,” Israel’s firebrand National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said as war with the Gaza Strip’s Hamas rulers rages on.
Israel unilaterally withdrew the last of its troops and settlers in 2005, ending a presence inside Gaza that began in 1967 but maintaining near complete control over the territory’s borders.
The government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not officially suggested it has any plans to evict Gazans or to send Jewish settlers back to the territory since the current war broke out on October 7.
But Ben Gvir argued that the departure of Palestinians and re-establishment of Israeli settlements “is a correct, just, moral and humane solution”.
“This is an opportunity to develop a project to encourage Gaza’s residents to emigrate to countries around the world,” he told a meeting of his ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit, or “Jewish Power”, party.
Hamas dismissed Ben Gvir’s proposal as a “daydream”.

“You will not find a way to implement it in the face of our resilient, steadfast Palestinian people and their heroic resistance,” the Islamist group said in a statement.
Ben Gvir’s comment came the day after far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also called for the return of settlers to Gaza, equally saying Israel should “encourage” the territory’s approximately 2.4 million Palestinians to leave.
Smotrich said that for Israel to “control the territory militarily for a long time, we need a civilian presence”.
Both Ben Gvir and Smotrich live in settlements in the occupied West Bank, considered illegal under international law.
Hamas on Sunday had also condemned Smotrich’s comments as a “vile mockery and a war crime”.
The October 7 Hamas attack left about 1,140 people dead in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Israel’s ongoing offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas, has killed at least 21,978 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
With heavy combat raging on, 85 percent of people in the besieged Gaza Strip have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations.

Israel's top court strikes down key government legal reform challenging power of judiciary,"
ISRAEL’S TOP COURT ruled today against a key component of the government’s controversial legal overhaul, which challenged the powers of the judiciary and sparked mass protests.
A Supreme Court statement said eight of 15 justices had ruled against an amendment passed by parliament in July which scraps the “reasonableness” clause, used by the court to overturn government decisions which are deemed unconstitutional.
“This is due to the severe and unprecedented damage to the basic characteristics of the State of Israel as a democratic state,” the statement said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had argued the sweeping judicial reform package presented a year ago was necessary to rebalance powers between judges and politicians.
But his detractors warn the multi-pronged package paved the way for authoritarian rule and could be used by Netanyahu to quash possible convictions against him, an accusation the premier denies.
Justice Minister Yariv Levin slammed the judges for “taking into their hands all the powers, which in a democratic regime are divided in a balanced way between the three branches” of government.

Levin, the architect of the judicial overhaul, said on Telegram that the ruling “takes away from millions of citizens their voice”.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators had rallied weekly against the government reforms, with protests only ending due to the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October.
The “reasonableness” amendment, the only major part of the legal reform package to become law, was also one its most contentious steps as it sought to curb judicial oversight of the government.
When Netanyahu’s allies voted to scrap the reasonableness clause in July, opposition lawmakers stormed out of the chamber, shouting “shame”.
The law has been cited in only a handful of court decisions, including a high-profile ruling last year which barred a Netanyahu ally from serving in the cabinet because of a previous tax evasion conviction.

"Israel warns Gaza war will continue throughout 2024, as overnight strikes kill more than 20","LAST UPDATE|1 Jan

ISRAEL WARNED ITS war against Hamas will continue throughout 2024 as unrelenting strikes killed two dozen people in Gaza and the Palestinian militant group fired a rocket barrage at the stroke of midnight.
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a New Year’s message that some of the 300,000 army reservists would get a break from the war, in order to prepare for the “prolonged fighting” ahead.
The army “must plan ahead, understanding that we will be required for additional tasks and warfare throughout this year,” Hagari said as the conflict sparked by the 7 October Hamas attacks raged on.
Heavy artillery fire again pounded targets in Hamas-run Gaza, killing at least 24 people, health ministry officials there said, with attacks reported across the length of the territory.
In the besieged Gaza Strip, where the UN says 85 percent of the population has been displaced, 20-year-old Hamdan Abu Arab said he hoped “2024 will be better”.
“We used to go out and enjoy our time on the last day of the year,” he recalled. “But this New Year’s Eve, there are only missiles and the remains of people.”
Hamas marked the start of the year by firing a rocket barrage at Israel in what it called a “response to the massacres of civilians”.
AFP journalists in Tel Aviv witnessed missile defence systems intercept rockets overhead as some revellers ran for cover and others kept up the party with a shrug.
“My heart was pounding,” said one, Gabriel Zemelman, 26, shortly after the rocket fire. ”It’s terrifying. You just saw the life we live, it’s crazy.”
The bloodiest ever Gaza war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October attacks on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
The militants also took around 250 people hostage that day, more than half of whom remain in Gaza, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and launched a punishing offensive that has reduced vast areas of Gaza to a ruined wasteland and killed at least 21,822 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s health ministry.
The Israeli army says 172 of its soldiers have been killed inside Gaza in the battle against the Islamist militant group which Israel, the United States and European Union have designated a “terrorist” organisation.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Saturday that the fighting would last “many months until Hamas is eliminated and the hostages are returned”.
Hagari said “we are also currently adapting the planning of the force deployment in Gaza and the reserve system. Some of the reservists will return to their families and employment this week.
“This will significantly ease the burden on the economy and allow them to gather strength for the upcoming activities in the next year, as the fighting will continue and they will still be required.”

Since Israel imposed a siege at the outset of the war, Gazans have been facing dire shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine.
UN chief Antonio Guterres has condemned the “epic human suffering” and “collective punishment” of Palestinian civilians, while the WHO has warned of the risk of hunger and infectious disease.
“We are exhausted… We were displaced five times during this war,” said 29-year-old Bassam Hana.
“We hope things improve in 2024 and that we live just like any other human being. Currently, we live like animals.”
At least 48 Palestinians were killed in strikes on Gaza City over the weekend, the territory’s health ministry said, with many still buried under the rubble.
“After the explosion we arrived at the scene of the strike and saw martyrs everywhere,” said one resident after a building was hit. ”Children are still missing, we can’t find them.”
Hagari, in a briefing yesterday, said several militants “were killed and subdued during the battles in Khan Yunis”, the main southern city, earlier in the day.
“We are continuing to handle the underground tunnels and to strike the rocket launching array, in order to reduce rocket fire into the State of Israel,” he said, adding that “dozens of aircrafts are in the skies of Gaza at any given moment”.
International mediators have continued efforts toward a new pause in fighting.
A Hamas delegation from Qatar visited Cairo on Friday to discuss an Egyptian three-phase plan proposing renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately an end to the war, sources close to Hamas said.
Their allies Islamic Jihad said on Saturday that Palestinian factions were evaluating the proposal and would give a response “within days”.
The war in Gaza has raised fears of a broader regional conflict, with hostilities flaring with mostly Iran-backed militant groups in nearby countries who say they are acting in support of Hamas.
The Israeli army announced last night having intercepted two “hostile aircraft” launched from Syria towards northern Israel.
Earlier it had reported launches toward Israeli territory from Lebanon, where it has fought the Hezbollah militant group.
“Throughout the day, IDF (military) tanks and helicopters targeted three terrorist squads operating in Lebanon,” the army said in a statement.
And in the Red Sea, the US military said yesterday that Navy helicopters had fired at Iran-backed Huthi rebel boats off Yemen that were attacking a cargo ship, with Yemeni sources reporting 10 rebels killed.

"At least 48 Palestinians killed in overnight Israeli strikes on Gaza, health ministry says","LAST UPDATE|31 Dec 2023
ISRAELI STRIKES HAVE pounded Gaza today as both sides near the end of a dark year and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the offensive sparked by Hamas’s 7 October attack will last for “many months”.
At least 48 Palestinians were killed in overnight bombing in Gaza City, the health ministry in the Gaza Strip said, with many still buried under the rubble.
Another strike killed 20 people sheltering at Al-Aqsa University in the west of Gaza city, witnesses said.
The Israeli army reported killing around a dozen enemy fighters in multiple ground battles, air and tank strikes and said it had located Hamas tunnels, and explosives planted in a kindergarten.
As heavy combat raged on, 85% of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been displaced, according to the UN, which warns of a growing risk of hunger and disease as desperate families shelter in makeshift tents against the winter cold.
The world has watched on in horror for months as the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict exploded into the bloodiest ever Gaza conflict after Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on 7 October.
The Palestinian gunmen overwhelmed Gaza’s high-tech border fence and burst into southern Israel in an attack that killed about 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
The surprise attack – in which Hamas militants committed atrocities and dragged off some 250 hostages – blindsided and infuriated Israel and sparked a devastating military response.
Heavy bombardment, and a ground invasion launched three weeks into the offensive, have reduced vast areas of Gaza to a ruined wasteland and killed at least 21,822 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.

More than 55,000 people have been injured, it said, at a time when most Gaza hospitals are either out of service or damaged and overwhelmed.
The Israeli army says 172 of its soldiers have been killed inside Gaza, and Netanyahu said Israeli forces had killed about 8,000 “terrorists” so far.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
In a statement this evening, President Michael D Higgins called on “all nations to redouble their efforts for an immediate ceasefire” in Gaza.
President Higgins said that as the year comes to an end, it is important “that we reflect on what steps the international community can take in order to help bring a lasting and meaningful peace to the region”.
“When wars and conflicts become seemingly unending, humanity is the loser,” he said.

“The awful loss of life which we have witnessed in recent months has led to a broad re-statement of the need for a two-state solution.
“However, for this to have meaning, there is a need to move beyond a theoretical commitment and for detailed consideration to resume of the specific details of how this can be achieved.
“It is my hope that it will not be long until the international community comes together to commence the serious, crucial negotiations that will be needed in the time ahead.”
President Higgins said that “essential elements” of the negotiations will include the requirement for a Palestinian state to be contiguous, the capacity for the State to produce its own products and release them to the market without hindrance and air, sea and land sovereignty.
He continued: “The horrific violence and loss of life which we have seen since the attacks carried out by Hamas in Israel on 7 October, followed by the devastation caused by the Israeli response in Gaza, as well as continuing violence by settlers in the West Bank, highlight the urgency of this task,
“The Irish Government has given a lead in raising these issues through the European and international institutions.
“Far too many lives, and particularly children’s lives, have already been lost.”
UN chief Antonio Guterres has condemned the “epic human suffering” and “collective punishment” of Palestinian civilians.
He and other world leaders have repeatedly called for a ceasefire while Israel has vowed to push on until Hamas is defeated, a position backed by its powerful ally the United States.
“The war will continue for many months until Hamas is eliminated and the hostages are returned,” Netanyahu reiterated at a news conference on Saturday.
Today, he vowed: “We will continue our defensive war, the justice and morality of which is without peer.”

Inside Gaza, Palestinian families – many pushed into the territory’s far south as the battlefront draws ever closer – are praying for a respite from the war.
“We were hoping that 2024 would arrive under better auspices and that we would be able to celebrate the new year at home with our families,” said Mahmoud Abou Shahma, 33, in a camp in Rafah on the border with Egypt.
At least 129 hostages are still believed held in Gaza after more than 100 were released in a prisoner swap during a week-long truce in late November.
Families and friends of the remaining captives have rallied to keep up pressure on the government to bring them home.
“I hope there’s going to be another deal, even a partial deal, or that some will be released,” said one demonstrator, Nir Shafran, 45.
“I’m trying to hold on to every shred of hope.”

International mediators have continued efforts toward a new pause in fighting.
A Hamas delegation from Qatar visited Cairo on Friday to discuss an Egyptian three-phase plan proposing renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately an end to the conflict, sources close to Hamas said.
Their allies Islamic Jihad said yesterday that Palestinian factions were “in the process” of evaluating the proposal and would give a response “within days”.

US news outlet Axios and Israeli website Ynet, both citing unnamed Israeli officials, reported that Qatari mediators had told Israel that Hamas was prepared to resume talks on new hostage releases in exchange for a ceasefire.
Netanyahu, asked about the process yesterday, said Hamas had been “giving all kinds of ultimatums that we didn’t accept”.
“We are seeing a certain shift (but) I don’t want to create an expectation,” he said without elaborating.
Amid the Gaza conflict, violence has also flared in the occupied West Bank, and between Israel and some of its regional enemies, an alliance of Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
Israeli forces have traded heavy fire with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah across the UN-patrolled border.
Netanyahu warned that “if Hezbollah wants to extend the war, it will be dealt blows like never before, and so will Iran”.
Hezbollah’s number two Naim Qassem said today that Israel “first must stop the Gaza war in order for the war in Lebanon to stop”.
Another Iran ally, Yemen’s Huthi rebels, has launched drone and missile attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea, saying the strikes are in support of Palestinians in Gaza.
Washington has assembled a multinational naval task force to deter such attacks.
The military said today that US Navy helicopters sank three Huthi vessels and killed their crews after they had attacked a Danish-owned container ship.
At least 10 rebels were killed when US forces struck their boats, two sources at the rebel-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida said.

'The bombs keep falling on us': Gazans desperate for war to end as Israel presses offensive,"LAST UPDATE|30 Dec 2023

FIGHTING IS STILL raging today across Gaza, where displaced Palestinians said they were “exhausted” with no end in sight to the war between the besieged territory’s Hamas rulers and Israel, now in its 13th week.
Smoke billowed over the Gaza Strip’s southern city of Khan Yunis, the focus of recent fighting in the grinding war, which was triggered by Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October.
Further south, the border city of Rafah near Egypt was teeming with Gazans seeking safety from Israel’s relentless bombardment in its fight against Palestinian militants.
“Enough with this war! We are totally exhausted,” Umm Louay Abu Khater, a 49-year-old woman who had fled her home in Khan Yunis, taking refuge in Rafah, said.
“We are constantly displaced from one place to another in cold weather,” she said. “The bombs keep falling on us day and night.”
The Israeli army kept up its campaign in the face of mounting international pushback, reporting “fierce battles” and air strikes across the Palestinian territory.
The fighting began with Hamas’s bloody 7 October attacks, which left about 1,140 people dead in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also took about 250 people hostage, and Israel says 129 of them remain in captivity.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says the Israeli military campaign has killed at least 21,672 people, mostly women and children.
A ministry statement on Saturday said 165 Gazans were killed over the previous 24 hours.
The Israeli army says 168 soldiers have been killed in combat inside the territory.
An AFP correspondent reported continuous shelling of Rafah and Khan Yunis overnight, and the health ministry said “multiple” people had died in a strike on a house in Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza.
‘Year of destruction’
Medics in Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis said they were facing severe shortages.

“The hospital is receiving a lot more (patients) than its capacity, in fact we are functioning at 300% of our… capacity,” doctor Ahmad Abu Mustafa said in footage shared by the World Health Organization (WHO).
“The beds are full… and we are basically short on all sorts of medicine supplies.”
The health ministry appealed to the international community for more support, including greater assistance in evacuating more patients.
The fighting has put 23 hospitals and 53 health centres out of service, while 104 ambulances have been destroyed, the ministry said.
In central Gaza’s Zawayda, Palestinians pulled the body of a child from under the rubble after an Israeli strike.
“We pulled (out) nine martyrs, who were members of a very peaceful family. Two adjacent houses were targeted,” the area’s civil defence director, Rami al-Aidi, said.
In Deir al-Balah, farther south, slain reporter Jabr Abu Hadrous was laid to rest.
“Palestinian journalists are killed, arrested and prosecuted,” said fellow journalist Basel Khalaf, calling on the international community to “stand by Palestinian journalists, not only in words but also in actions”.

In north Gaza, the Israeli army said dozens of “terrorists” were killed in Gaza City and “two Hamas military compounds were dismantled” in Beit Lahia.
Ahmed al-Baz, a 33-year-old Palestinian displaced from Gaza City, said this year had been “the worst in my life”.
“It was a year of destruction and devastation,” he said in Rafah, surrounded by tents in a makeshift camp.
“We just want the war to end, and start the new year at home, with a ceasefire declared.”
Mediation efforts
International mediators — who last month brokered a one-week truce that saw more than 100 hostages released and some aid enter Gaza — continue in their efforts to secure a new pause in fighting.
US news outlet Axios and Israeli website Ynet, both citing unnamed Israeli officials, reported that Qatari mediators had told Israel that Hamas was prepared to resume talks on new hostage releases in exchange for a ceasefire.

And a Hamas delegation was in Cairo on Friday to discuss an Egyptian plan proposing renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately an end to the war, sources close to Hamas say.
Islamic Jihad, another armed group fighting alongside Hamas, said on Saturday that Palestinian factions were “in the process” of evaluating the Egyptian proposal.
A response will come “within days, and the brothers in Egypt will be informed”, according to Muhammad al-Hindi, Islamic Jihad’s deputy secretary-general.
Israel has yet to formally comment on the Cairo plan, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told families of hostages on Thursday that “we are in contact” with the Egyptian mediators.
The United States announced on Friday it had approved a $147.5 million (about €133.6 million) sale of 155mm high-explosive artillery munitions and related equipment to Israel under an emergency provision.
Hamas today said the sale was “clear evidence of the American administration’s full sponsorship of this criminal war”.
An Israeli siege imposed after 7 October, following years of crippling blockade, has led to dire shortages of food, safe water, fuel and medicine in Gaza, with aid convoys offering only sporadic relief.
On Friday, a total of 72 aid trucks, most of them carrying food, entered Gaza, according to the territory’s border crossings authority.
Gaza also received four fuel trucks and 29 commercial food trucks, it said.
The UN says more than 85% of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have fled their homes.
South Africa on Friday filed an application at the International Court of Justice to start proceedings for what it said were “genocidal acts” in Gaza, which Israel dismissed as “blood libel”.
The Gaza war has intensified tensions across the region.
Israel has traded regular cross-border fire with Lebanon’s powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, and early on Saturday the army said it had carried out strikes in Syria following rocket launches.
The bombardment killed two fighters from a Hezbollah-linked group, Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

"Opinion 
 We are living in difficult times – but we must not give up hope","LAST UPDATE|28 Dec 2023
THESE DAYS ARE bleak. As we celebrate Christmas and New Year there’s no escaping the devastating and brutal war in Gaza. There’s no escaping the fact that if the bombs don’t kill in Gaza, hunger and disease will.
As a humanitarian who has been working in the human rights and development sector for almost two decades, I can’t remember a year ending with so much turmoil and disregard for human life.
I can’t remember having such despair in our institutions. Despite some welcome efforts, including from Ireland, the world powers have been utterly incapable of stopping the killing of children, women and men at an unprecedented scale in Gaza.
There’s no escaping the wider challenges and crises that are ever present in many places were ActionAid works, and across the world as a whole – climate, hunger, poverty, inequality, gender-based violence.
During 2023 we saw horrific violence. We saw millions forcibly displaced, mass destruction of homes, hospitals, schools, health facilities and other critical civilian infrastructure and increasing climate emergencies. But there are few clear political resolutions in sight to put an end to the numerous crises causing misery to millions.
Over 21,000 lives have been blown apart, more than two-thirds of those innocent women and children. This conflict has been very real and very visible, mainly due to the bravery of Palestinian journalists. Through their lens, we have seen broken bodies of sometimes entire families pulled out from under the rubble of their destroyed homes; children screaming in pain in overcrowded hospitals being operated on without anaesthetic; human limbs being picked out of piles of stone, and burials in mass graves of people shrouded in blood-stained white sheets, many not identified. They were not even afforded the dignity of a proper farewell.

Gaza, 2023AIN MediaAIN Media
But with the spotlight on Gaza, we must not forget other ongoing crises. The war in Ukraine continues unabated and will be two years old in February. More than 10,000 civilians have lost their lives and the impact of displacement, trauma and death are both immediate and long-lasting.
Also of deep concern is Sudan. It is seven months since fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces erupted and Sudan is now facing a severe humanitarian crisis with 5.8 million people displaced, making it the country with the highest number of displaced individuals globally. It is also among the top four hot spots for food insecurity.
The situation is particularly dire there for children. Three million have fled violence, marking Sudan as the largest child displacement crisis, and at least 700,000 children are now at risk of acute malnutrition and mortality. Concerns have been raised about the abduction and abuse of women and girls.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, nearly a million people have been displaced alone in 2023 due to the conflict. Overall, since 1996, the conflict is estimated to have cost six million lives. Sexual and gender-based violence is widespread. The presence of armed groups and the flow of arms are contributing to a highly precarious and volatile situation. Children are being kidnapped or recruited by armed groups, and many have not had a stable home or education for two years.
Gaza, 2023AIN MediaAIN Media
And among the greatest threats we face is the very one we’re struggling to face up to — the climate crisis. People in the Global South continue to suffer the worst effects of climate chaos — more extreme and more frequent weather events. This compounds poverty and inequality and undermines attempts to alleviate poverty.
The response of world leaders is still not one of urgency, despite the fact we are hurtling towards climate collapse evidenced by the fact that this has been the hottest year on record, leaving a trail of devastation and despair.
While there was some progress at the recent COP28 climate summit in Dubai, with indications of an increased appetite for climate action, it is not as strongly focused on a fast, fair and full phase out of fossil fuels as it needs to be. And rich countries are still not putting their money where their mouths are, with willingness to fund a fossil-free future sorely lacking.
Lower income countries are already being pushed into debt by the cost of climate disasters and the danger is they will be forced to make impossible choices between economic security and climate action.

During crises, gender-based violence increases, rooted in deeply unequal power structures and discriminatory norms and practices. For example, violence is multiplied when women and girls are displaced and/or in emergency shelters where there no reporting or protection mechanisms. Trafficking in women and girls for domestic labour or sexual exploitation has been found to increase up to 30 per cent in displacement sites and during a disaster.
However, it is vital that we do not give up hope. Because there is always hope. As we greet a new year and bear witness to growing humanitarian needs and the tremendous suffering of millions of people, we find hope in the incredible resilience and courage of communities who rebuild their lives, against the odds.
There is hope in the courage and commitment of doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers, and humanitarian workers – in Gaza and around the world — who are putting their lives at risk on the front lines to save lives.
There is hope in people power demanding more from governments. As our institutions let us down, everyday people, particularly young people, continually push for a better world, particularly in the area of climate change and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
I look at my four-year-old daughter and wonder what sort of world will be there for her. She will grow up facing these challenges and the impact of the world’s failure to tackle the climate crisis, conflict and injustice. But she will also grow up among the young people who are demanding better.
Her generation will be our future political, business and social leaders, and with them comes the hope of a world where peace will prevail, and the climate crisis train will be slowed down. We must not let hope fade and do everything we can, right now, to make it better for them.

FIGHTING IS STILL raging today across Gaza, where displaced Palestinians said they were “exhausted” with no end in sight to the war between the besieged territory’s Hamas rulers and Israel, now in its 13th week.
Smoke billowed over the Gaza Strip’s southern city of Khan Yunis, the focus of recent fighting in the grinding war, which was triggered by Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October.
Further south, the border city of Rafah near Egypt was teeming with Gazans seeking safety from Israel’s relentless bombardment in its fight against Palestinian militants.
“Enough with this war! We are totally exhausted,” Umm Louay Abu Khater, a 49-year-old woman who had fled her home in Khan Yunis, taking refuge in Rafah, said.
“We are constantly displaced from one place to another in cold weather,” she said. “The bombs keep falling on us day and night.”
The Israeli army kept up its campaign in the face of mounting international pushback, reporting “fierce battles” and air strikes across the Palestinian territory.
The fighting began with Hamas’s bloody 7 October attacks, which left about 1,140 people dead in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also took about 250 people hostage, and Israel says 129 of them remain in captivity.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says the Israeli military campaign has killed at least 21,672 people, mostly women and children.
A ministry statement on Saturday said 165 Gazans were killed over the previous 24 hours.
The Israeli army says 168 soldiers have been killed in combat inside the territory.
An AFP correspondent reported continuous shelling of Rafah and Khan Yunis overnight, and the health ministry said “multiple” people had died in a strike on a house in Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza.
‘Year of destruction’
Medics in Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis said they were facing severe shortages.

“The hospital is receiving a lot more (patients) than its capacity, in fact we are functioning at 300% of our… capacity,” doctor Ahmad Abu Mustafa said in footage shared by the World Health Organization (WHO).
“The beds are full… and we are basically short on all sorts of medicine supplies.”
The health ministry appealed to the international community for more support, including greater assistance in evacuating more patients.
The fighting has put 23 hospitals and 53 health centres out of service, while 104 ambulances have been destroyed, the ministry said.
In central Gaza’s Zawayda, Palestinians pulled the body of a child from under the rubble after an Israeli strike.
“We pulled (out) nine martyrs, who were members of a very peaceful family. Two adjacent houses were targeted,” the area’s civil defence director, Rami al-Aidi, said.
In Deir al-Balah, farther south, slain reporter Jabr Abu Hadrous was laid to rest.
“Palestinian journalists are killed, arrested and prosecuted,” said fellow journalist Basel Khalaf, calling on the international community to “stand by Palestinian journalists, not only in words but also in actions”.

In north Gaza, the Israeli army said dozens of “terrorists” were killed in Gaza City and “two Hamas military compounds were dismantled” in Beit Lahia.
Ahmed al-Baz, a 33-year-old Palestinian displaced from Gaza City, said this year had been “the worst in my life”.
“It was a year of destruction and devastation,” he said in Rafah, surrounded by tents in a makeshift camp.
“We just want the war to end, and start the new year at home, with a ceasefire declared.”
Mediation efforts
International mediators — who last month brokered a one-week truce that saw more than 100 hostages released and some aid enter Gaza — continue in their efforts to secure a new pause in fighting.
US news outlet Axios and Israeli website Ynet, both citing unnamed Israeli officials, reported that Qatari mediators had told Israel that Hamas was prepared to resume talks on new hostage releases in exchange for a ceasefire.

And a Hamas delegation was in Cairo on Friday to discuss an Egyptian plan proposing renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and ultimately an end to the war, sources close to Hamas say.
Islamic Jihad, another armed group fighting alongside Hamas, said on Saturday that Palestinian factions were “in the process” of evaluating the Egyptian proposal.
A response will come “within days, and the brothers in Egypt will be informed”, according to Muhammad al-Hindi, Islamic Jihad’s deputy secretary-general.
Israel has yet to formally comment on the Cairo plan, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told families of hostages on Thursday that “we are in contact” with the Egyptian mediators.
The United States announced on Friday it had approved a $147.5 million (about €133.6 million) sale of 155mm high-explosive artillery munitions and related equipment to Israel under an emergency provision.
Hamas today said the sale was “clear evidence of the American administration’s full sponsorship of this criminal war”.
An Israeli siege imposed after 7 October, following years of crippling blockade, has led to dire shortages of food, safe water, fuel and medicine in Gaza, with aid convoys offering only sporadic relief.
On Friday, a total of 72 aid trucks, most of them carrying food, entered Gaza, according to the territory’s border crossings authority.
Gaza also received four fuel trucks and 29 commercial food trucks, it said.
The UN says more than 85% of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have fled their homes.
South Africa on Friday filed an application at the International Court of Justice to start proceedings for what it said were “genocidal acts” in Gaza, which Israel dismissed as “blood libel”.
The Gaza war has intensified tensions across the region.
Israel has traded regular cross-border fire with Lebanon’s powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, and early on Saturday the army said it had carried out strikes in Syria following rocket launches.
The bombardment killed two fighters from a Hezbollah-linked group, Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Israel continues to pound Gaza as Egypt to host high-level Hamas delegation for ceasefire talks,"
ISRAEL HAS POUNDED south and central Gaza today as Egypt is to host a high-level Hamas delegation for talks to try and end the nearly 12-week conflict that has devastated the besieged Palestinian territory.
The Israeli military said its forces “are extending operation in Khan Yunis” in the coastal territory’s south, and had “eliminated dozens of terrorists” across Gaza over the past 24 hours.
AFPTV footage showed smoke billowing over Rafah, near Egypt, following fresh strikes early today.
Israeli shelling near Al-Amal in Khan Yunis killed 41 people over the past two days, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said yesterday.
The casualties in repeated Israeli strikes near the facility include “displaced persons seeking shelter”, it said.
The UN humanitarian office said an estimated 100,000 more displaced people had arrived in the already-teeming southern border city of Rafah in recent days following the intensification of fighting around Deir al-Balah and Khan Yunis.
At Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, Palestinians gathered to identify loved ones killed in strikes.
The fighting left much of Gaza’s north in ruins, while the battlefront has shifted ever further to the south and raised tensions across the Middle East.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the 7 October attack which left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Around 250 hostages were also taken during the attack, more than half of whom remain captive.

Israel’s relentless aerial bombardment and ground invasion in Gaza have killed at least 21,507 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza.
The figure includes 187 fatalities over the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said.

The Israeli army says 168 of its soldiers have been killed inside Gaza.
Sources close to Hamas say Egypt’s three-stage plan provides for renewable ceasefires, a staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and ultimately an end to the war.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
Hamas’s military wing, Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said today it launched a fresh barrage of rockets at southern Israel.
Israel has repeatedly said that one of the chief goals of the conflict is the return of the 129 hostages it says remain in Gaza.
Yesterday, an Israeli kibbutz community said one of its residents, US-Israeli Judith Weinstein Haggai, 70, who was thought to be the oldest woman held captive had in fact died in the 7 October attack and her body held by militants.
US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” by the news.
The UN says more than 80% of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been driven from their homes. Many now live in cramped shelters in the tiny territory or in makeshift tents around Rafah.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said 308 people seeking shelter in their facilities have been killed during the war.
Residents in Rafah combed through rubble for survivors yesterday after an air strike that one witness said left “several casualties”.
Tayseer Abu al-Eish said he was at home when “all of a sudden we heard a loud explosion and debris started falling on us. The apartment was completely destroyed and my daughters were screaming”.

An Israeli siege imposed after 7 October, following years of crippling blockade, has deprived Gazans of food, water, fuel and medicine.
A UN aid convoy yesterday came under fire by the Israeli military without causing casualties, UNRWA said.
The severe shortages have been only sporadically eased by humanitarian aid convoys entering primarily via Egypt.

Rafah residents and displaced people thronged a Rafah market this morning to buy food, including fresh fruit, eggs and meat, trucked in the previous night from Egypt.
“This is the first time eggs and some types of fruit have entered Gaza from Egypt,” said vendor Muntasser al-Shaer.
“All types of fruit are missing in the markets, there are some types of vegetables but they’re really expensive,” he added.
UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths described on social media what he called “an impossible situation for the people of Gaza, and for those trying to help them”.
“You think getting aid into Gaza is easy? Think again,” he wrote Friday on X.
A Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP the delegation in Cairo would “give the response of the Palestinian factions, including several observations” regarding the Egyptian proposal, recently put to officials from Hamas and another Gaza armed group, Islamic Jihad.
Hamas would also seek “guarantees for a complete Israeli military withdrawal” from Gaza, the official said.
The proposal provides for a Palestinian government of technocrats after talks involving “all Palestinian factions”, which would be responsible for governing and rebuilding in post-war Gaza.
Egypt’s State Information Services chief Dia Rashwan said the plan was “intended to bring together the views of all parties concerned, with the aim of ending the shedding of Palestinian blood”.
In Tel Aviv, hundreds rallied yesterday calling for a ceasefire.
The bloodiest ever Gaza conflict has also sharply heightened tensions between Israel and its long-time arch foe Iran, which supports armed groups across the Middle East.
Israel has traded heavy cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah since the Gaza conflict erupted, and today said its military had struck “Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon” after reporting rocket fire from there.
Later, the army said sirens warning of incoming fire blared in Israel’s north.

President Higgins criticises Israel for blaming UN agencies for 'slow trickle' of aid into Gaza,"IRELAND’S PRESIDENT MICHAEL D. Higgins has criticised Israel’s forces for releasing a statement which claimed aid reaching Gaza at a slow place is down to the The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).
Higgins said that the statement issued on behalf of Israeli forces is “deeply concerning and potentially undermines and detracts from the integrity of UNRWA and its critical and vital work at this time”.
The President said that those who support the UN and its agencies should “seek independent verification of what is blocking aid in Gaza”.
Higgins said that everyone who believes in the United Nations and its work, and who respect the resolution it passed two weeks ago, “must back UNRWA and the vital work that it is doing in the most difficult of circumstances”.

Last Friday the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the expedition of aid deliveries to citizens in Gaza who are starving and without adequate medical care.

The vote was 13-0, with the US and Russia abstaining. The US, however, did not veto the resolution. Russia wanted the resolution to feature stronger language and called the version of it that passed “toothless”, the US took an opposing stance.
Its passing came after intense diplomatic negotiations, and the resolution that passed featured considerably weakened language. It did not call for an immediate ceasefire.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Twitter, now known as X, that he hopes the resolution “may help improve the delivery of much-needed aid, but a humanitarian ceasefire is the only way to begin meeting the desperate needs of people in Gaza and end their ongoing nightmare”.
The UN Palestinian envoy said it took the Security Council 75 days “to finally utter the words ‘cessation of hostilities,’”. Riyad Mansour did say, however, that the resolution was a “step in the right direction”.

South Africa launches genocide case against Israel at International Court of Justice,"SOUTH AFRICA HAS launched a case at the United Nations’ top court accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and asking the court to order Israel to halt its attacks.
The country’s submission to the International Court of Justice alleges that “acts and omissions by Israel … are genocidal in character” as they are committed with the intent “to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”.
It also asks the Hague-based court to issue an interim order for Israel to immediately suspend its military operations in Gaza.
A hearing into that request is likely in the coming days or weeks. The case, if it goes ahead, will take years.
It is the first such challenge made at the court over the current war and Israel swiftly rejected the filing “with disgust”.

South Africa can bring the case under the Genocide Convention because both it and Israel are signatories to the convention.
The Israeli government “rejected with disgust” the South African genocide accusations, calling it a “blood libel”.
A Foreign Ministry statement said the case lacks a legal foundation and constitutes a “vile exploitation and cheapening” of the court.
Israel also accused South Africa of co-operating with Hamas, the militant group whose October 7 cross-border attack in southern Israel triggered the ongoing war in Gaza.

The statement also said Israel is committed to, and operates according to, international law and focuses its military actions solely against Hamas, adding that the residents of Gaza are not an enemy.
It asserted that it takes steps to minimise harm to civilians and to allow humanitarian aid to enter the territory.
Whether the case will succeed in halting the war remains to be seen. While the court’s orders are legally binding, they are not always followed.
In March 2022, the court ordered Russia to halt hostilities in Ukraine, a binding legal ruling that Moscow flouted as it pressed ahead with its devastating attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities.
South Africa has been a fierce critic of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.
Many, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, have compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the West Bank with South Africa’s past apartheid regime of racial segregation.
Mr Ramaphosa has accused Israel of war crimes and acts “tantamount to genocide”.
South Africa’s foreign ministry said in a statement that the country is “gravely concerned with the plight of civilians caught in the present Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip due to the indiscriminate use of force and forcible removal of inhabitants”.

The ministry added that there are “ongoing reports of international crimes, such as crimes against humanity and war crimes, being committed as well as reports that acts meeting the threshold of genocide or related crimes as defined in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, have been and may still be committed in the context of the ongoing massacres in Gaza”.

US-Israeli woman believed to be held hostage in Gaza declared dead,"A HARD-HIT ISRAELI kibbutz has announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza.
The news came six days after Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead.
Weinstein, 70, and Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of 7 October when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others.
In the early hours of the morning, Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family.
Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza.
But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Haggai was killed on 7 October and his body was taken to Gaza.
Today, the kibbutz said it had learned that Weinstein was also killed on 7 October and her body is also being held in Gaza.
It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths.
The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said.
US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter.
The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement.

Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs.
The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza.
Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician.
“Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement.
Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go.
Almost all were women and children.
He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her.
According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity.
Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on 7 October, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped.
The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones.
Netanyahu met in Tel Aviv with some of the families today, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office.
“I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.","10.13pm, 28 Dec 2023",,

Gaza health ministry says at least 210 people killed in last 24 hours as Israel intensifies bombing,"
THE HEALTH MINISTRY in Gaza has said that at least 210 people have been killed in the besieged territory in the last 24 hours, “including entire families”.
Israeli forces heavily bombed the Gaza Strip today as the centre of fierce combat against Hamas moves steadily south, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.
The conflict since Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel has devastated much of northern Gaza as air and artillery strikes and house-to-house fighting have become heaviest in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
The health ministry in Gaza said today at least 21,320 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since 7 October.
Another 55,603 people have been wounded, health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said in a televised press conference.
Qudra said at least 210 people have been killed in Gaza over the past 24 hours “including entire families”.
In a statement, the health ministry also raised the alarm over the spread of disease among children and the overall lack of water, food and medicine in the besieged Strip.
“The humanitarian and health conditions of the displaced have reached catastrophic levels,” it said.
The Israeli army has deployed an additional brigade to Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, said military spokesman Daniel Hagari.
More than 80% of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been driven from their homes, the UN says, and many now live in cramped shelters or makeshift tents in the far south, in and around the city of Rafah near Egypt.
UN World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for “urgent steps to alleviate the grave peril” facing Gaza’s people, including “terrible injuries, acute hunger and… severe risk of disease”.
French President Emmanuel Macron, in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, voiced his “deepest concern at the very heavy civilian toll” and stressed “the need to work towards a lasting ceasefire”, Macron’s office said.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its 7 October attack, which left about 1,140 people dead, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.

The Palestinian militants also took around 250 hostages, 129 of whom remain in captivity – a source of intense grief and anxiety for their families who have held protests demanding urgent action to “bring them home”.
As the fighting between Hamas militants and Israeli forces raged in the southern city of Khan Yunis today, health officials called for medical facilities to be protected.
“The Israeli occupation is repeatedly targeting the vicinity of Nasser hospital and Al-Amal hospital, affiliated with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society,” the Gaza health ministry said.
Earlier today, the Red Crescent said it feared that the intensification of deadly strikes near Al-Amal hospital could be “a prelude to targeting it directly”, adding that at least 10 people had been killed in fresh shelling.
The Israeli army says 167 of its soldiers have been killed in combat inside Gaza against Hamas, considered a “terrorist” organisation by the US and EU.
An Israeli siege imposed in the wake of the 7 October attack – following years of crippling blockade – has deprived Gazans of food, water, fuel and medicine.
The severe shortages have only been sporadically eased by humanitarian aid convoys entering primarily via Egypt.
“We are tired of everything,” said Ekhlas Shnenou who fled her Gaza City home. “Enough with the war, enough with the pain, enough with the hunger.”
One of the many people displaced, 28-year-old Iman al-Masry, recently gave birth to quadruplets in a hospital in southern Gaza after fleeing her family’s home in the devastated north.
The arduous journey “affected my pregnancy”, she said, recounting that she gave birth by C-section on 18 December to two girls and two boys, one of whom was too fragile to leave hospital.

“They are very slim,” she said of the three other infants, speaking in a cramped schoolroom turned shelter in Deir al-Balah. “It’s cold and windy and there’s no bathtub… I just use wipes.”
It decried in a statement the “intensification” of Israeli strikes in the area of the facility, already hit earlier this week, where about 14,000 Palestinians are sheltering.
Violence has also flared across the Israel-occupied West Bank, with at least 314 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or settlers since 7 October, according to the territory’s health ministry.
Israeli forces overnight raided money exchange shops across the West Bank which the military said had provided funds for armed groups.
In Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority, one man was killed by the troops, according to the health ministry. An AFP journalist saw Palestinians hurl Molotov cocktails at the Israeli forces.

Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and regularly carries out raids there, though they are far less common in the territory’s institutional heart Ramallah.
AUnited Nations reportissued today has said the human rights situation in the occupied West Bank was rapidly deteriorating and urged Israel to “end unlawful killings” against the Palestinian population.

“The use of military tactics and weapons in law enforcement contexts, the use of unnecessary or disproportionate force, and the enforcement of broad, arbitrary and discriminatory movement restrictions that affect Palestinians are extremely troubling,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.
The report calls for an immediate end to the use of military weapons and means during law enforcement operations, an end to arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of Palestinians, and the lifting of discriminatory movement restrictions.
The bloodiest ever Gaza war has also sharply heightened tensions between Israel and its long-time arch foe Iran, which supports armed groups across the Middle East in what it dubs the “Axis of Resistance”.
Iran blamed Israel for a missile strike in Syria on Monday that killed the senior Iranian military commander Razi Moussavi, who was laid to rest at a tearful mass funeral in Tehran today.
The crowd chanted “Death to Israel” and “Death to America” after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led a prayer over the body of Moussavi, a top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ foreign operations arms the Quds Force.
Tehran has vowed to avenge the death of Moussavi, the most senior Guards general killed since the US assassination of Quds Force chief Qasem Soleimani in 2020.
Israel has traded heavy cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon since the Gaza war broke out, and warned it will step up military action unless the group’s militants withdraw further away from the border.
The army today said it intercepted a drone that crossed in from Lebanon over northern Israel after sirens blared in the Haifa area.
A drone also crashed near a village in the Israel-annexed Golan Heights late yesterday, Israel’s army said, after an Iraqi armed group with links to Hamas claimed responsibility for an attack in the area.
Another Iran ally, Yemen’s Huthi rebels, has launched repeated drone and missile attacks at Israel, which have been intercepted in the air, and fired at passing cargo ships in the Red Sea, disrupting international trade.

US-Israeli woman believed to be held hostage in Gaza declared dead,"A HARD-HIT ISRAELI kibbutz has announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza.
The news came six days after Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead.
Weinstein, 70, and Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of 7 October when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others.
In the early hours of the morning, Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family.
Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza.
But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Haggai was killed on 7 October and his body was taken to Gaza.
Today, the kibbutz said it had learned that Weinstein was also killed on 7 October and her body is also being held in Gaza.
It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths.
The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said.
US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter.
The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement.

Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs.
The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza.
Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician.
“Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement.
Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go.
Almost all were women and children.
He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her.
According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity.
Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on 7 October, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped.
The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones.
Netanyahu met in Tel Aviv with some of the families today, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office.
“I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.","10.13pm, 28 Dec 2023",,
Gaza health ministry says at least 210 people killed in last 24 hours as Israel intensifies bombing,"
THE HEALTH MINISTRY in Gaza has said that at least 210 people have been killed in the besieged territory in the last 24 hours, “including entire families”.
Israeli forces heavily bombed the Gaza Strip today as the centre of fierce combat against Hamas moves steadily south, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.
The conflict since Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel has devastated much of northern Gaza as air and artillery strikes and house-to-house fighting have become heaviest in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
The health ministry in Gaza said today at least 21,320 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since 7 October.
Another 55,603 people have been wounded, health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said in a televised press conference.
Qudra said at least 210 people have been killed in Gaza over the past 24 hours “including entire families”.
In a statement, the health ministry also raised the alarm over the spread of disease among children and the overall lack of water, food and medicine in the besieged Strip.
“The humanitarian and health conditions of the displaced have reached catastrophic levels,” it said.
The Israeli army has deployed an additional brigade to Khan Yunis, the hometown of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, said military spokesman Daniel Hagari.
More than 80% of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been driven from their homes, the UN says, and many now live in cramped shelters or makeshift tents in the far south, in and around the city of Rafah near Egypt.
UN World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for “urgent steps to alleviate the grave peril” facing Gaza’s people, including “terrible injuries, acute hunger and… severe risk of disease”.
French President Emmanuel Macron, in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, voiced his “deepest concern at the very heavy civilian toll” and stressed “the need to work towards a lasting ceasefire”, Macron’s office said.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its 7 October attack, which left about 1,140 people dead, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.

The Palestinian militants also took around 250 hostages, 129 of whom remain in captivity – a source of intense grief and anxiety for their families who have held protests demanding urgent action to “bring them home”.
As the fighting between Hamas militants and Israeli forces raged in the southern city of Khan Yunis today, health officials called for medical facilities to be protected.
“The Israeli occupation is repeatedly targeting the vicinity of Nasser hospital and Al-Amal hospital, affiliated with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society,” the Gaza health ministry said.
Earlier today, the Red Crescent said it feared that the intensification of deadly strikes near Al-Amal hospital could be “a prelude to targeting it directly”, adding that at least 10 people had been killed in fresh shelling.
The Israeli army says 167 of its soldiers have been killed in combat inside Gaza against Hamas, considered a “terrorist” organisation by the US and EU.
An Israeli siege imposed in the wake of the 7 October attack – following years of crippling blockade – has deprived Gazans of food, water, fuel and medicine.
The severe shortages have only been sporadically eased by humanitarian aid convoys entering primarily via Egypt.
“We are tired of everything,” said Ekhlas Shnenou who fled her Gaza City home. “Enough with the war, enough with the pain, enough with the hunger.”
One of the many people displaced, 28-year-old Iman al-Masry, recently gave birth to quadruplets in a hospital in southern Gaza after fleeing her family’s home in the devastated north.
The arduous journey “affected my pregnancy”, she said, recounting that she gave birth by C-section on 18 December to two girls and two boys, one of whom was too fragile to leave hospital.

“They are very slim,” she said of the three other infants, speaking in a cramped schoolroom turned shelter in Deir al-Balah. “It’s cold and windy and there’s no bathtub… I just use wipes.”
It decried in a statement the “intensification” of Israeli strikes in the area of the facility, already hit earlier this week, where about 14,000 Palestinians are sheltering.

"Gaza population in 'grave peril' due to acute hunger, says World Health Organisation","
THE POPULATION OF Gaza is in “grave peril”, the head of the World Health Organisation today warned, citing acute hunger and desperation throughout the war-torn Palestinian territory.
The WHO said it delivered supplies to two hospitals yesterday, with only 15 out of 36 hospitals in the Gaza Strip functioning with any capacity at all.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on the international community to take “urgent steps to alleviate the grave peril facing the population of Gaza and jeopardising the ability of humanitarian workers to help people with terrible injuries, acute hunger, and at severe risk of disease”.
In a statement, the WHO said its staff reported that “hungry people again stopped our convoys today in the hope of finding food”.
“WHO’s ability to supply medicines, medical supplies, and fuel to hospitals is being increasingly constrained by the hunger and desperation of people en route to, and within, hospitals we reach.”
The bloodiest-ever Gaza war erupted when Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October and killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
They took 250 hostages, of whom 129 remain inside Gaza, according to Israeli officials, in the worst attack in the country’s history.
Israel launched extensive aerial bombardment and a siege followed by a ground invasion.
The campaign has killed at least 21,110 people, mostly women and children, according to Hamas-run Gaza’s health ministry.
“The safety of our staff and continuity of operations depends on more food arriving in all of Gaza, immediately,” Tedros said.
Last week’s United Nations Security Council resolution called for the “safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale” – but did not call for an immediate end to fighting.

Tedros said the resolution “appeared to provide hope of an improvement in humanitarian aid distribution within Gaza.
“However, based on WHO eyewitness accounts on the ground, the resolution is tragically yet to have an impact.
“What we urgently need, right now, is a ceasefire to spare civilians from further violence and begin the long road towards reconstruction and peace.”
WHO teams visited two hospitals yesterday – Al-Shifa in the north and Al-Amal Palestine Red Crescent Society in the south – to deliver supplies and assess the needs on the ground.
It said a reported 50,000 people were seeking refuge at Al-Shifa, with 14,000 sheltering at Al-Amal.
“At Al-Amal, colleagues saw the aftermath of recent strikes that disabled the hospital’s radio tower and impacted the central ambulance dispatch system for the entire Khan Yunis area affecting more than 1.5 million people,” the WHO said.
Only five of its nine ambulances are still operational, while WHO staff said it was “impossible” to walk through the hospital “without stepping over patients and those seeking refuge”.
While transiting across Gaza, WHO staff saw “tens of thousands of people” on the move, on foot, on donkeys or in cars.
“WHO is extremely concerned this fresh displacement of people will further strain health facilities in the south, which are already struggling,” said Rik Peeperkorn, the UN health agency’s representative in the Palestinian territories.
“This forced mass movement of people will also lead to more overcrowding, increased risk of infectious diseases, and make it even harder to deliver humanitarian aid.”
According to the latest WHO assessments, Gaza has 13 partially functioning hospitals, two minimally functioning ones, and 21 that are not functioning at all.

"Death toll from Israeli assault on Gaza passes 21,000 as IDF says war will go on for months","LAST UPDATE|27 Dec 2023

THE ISRAELI BOMBARDMENT, siege and ground invasion of Gaza has killed more than 21,000 Palestinians, the Gaza health ministry has said, marking yet another grim milestone in the conflict that began in October.
The Gaza war “goes beyond a catastrophe and a genocide,” Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas charged in an interview on Egyptian television.
The Palestinian Authority chief argued the war “is much uglier than what happened” during the 1948 Nakba, or ‘catastrophe’, that led to Israel’s creation when 760,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes.
“Netanyahu’s plan is to get rid of the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority,” Abbas said.
Concerns overa spiralling humanitarian crisisinside the besieged territory have amplified calls for an end to the hostilities, while incidents linked to Iran-backed groups acting in solidarity with Palestine have fanned fears of a wider regional conflict.
Yesterday, the United States reported shooting down a barrage of drones and missiles over the Red Sea fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
Meanwhile the Israeli army’s chief said earlier today that the war in Gaza would go on for “many more months”.
Israel’s leaders have repeatedly vowed to keep up their offensive until Hamas is destroyed, and army chief Herzi Halevi signalled there would be no quick end to the war.
“This war’s objectives are essential and not simple to achieve,” Halevi said last night.
“Therefore, the war will continue for many more months.”
The conflict erupted when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October and killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
During the attack – the deadliest in Israel’s history – Hamas also took around 250 hostages, of whom 129 remain inside Gaza, Israel says.
Israel retaliated with a relentless bombardment and a siege followed by a ground invasion.
The campaign has killed at least 21,110 people, according to the latest toll issued by Gaza’s health ministry, which added that more than 55,000 people had been wounded.
Since the siege went into effect, Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been suffering severe shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine, with only limited aid entering the territory. An estimated 1.9 million Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN.
In the southern city of Rafah, where many displaced people have sought refuge, hundreds turned up at the Abdul Salam Yassin water company yesterday carrying baskets, pulling handcarts and even pushing a wheelchair stacked with bottles to queue for clean water.
“This was my father’s cart,” said Rafah resident Amir al-Zahhar. “He was martyred during the war. He used it to transport and sell fish, and now we are using it to transport fresh water.”
Elsewhere in the city, people split logs and stacked kindling as the lack of fuel forced them to burn wood for cooking and to keep warm.
One woman took advantage of the sunshine yesterday to wash her family’s clothes by hand, telling AFP: “I’ve pleaded with people for water. I have absolutely nothing. I’ve borrowed everything, even the blankets, from others.”
The UN Security Council, in a resolution last week, called for the “safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale”.
It requested the appointment of a UN humanitarian coordinator to oversee and verify third-country aid to Gaza, and yesterday Sigrid Kaag, the outgoing Dutch finance minister, was named to the post.
The resolution, which did not call for an immediate end to the fighting, effectively leaves Israel with operational oversight of aid deliveries.

Israel returned the bodies of 80 Palestinians killed in Gaza after taking them from morgues and graves to check there were no hostages among them, sources in the territory’s health ministry said.
The bodies, which had been transported to Israel, were returned through the Red Cross to Hamas authorities who buried them in a mass grave in Gaza, the sources said.

An AFP photographer saw a digger lowering the blue body bags into a trench in Rafah, in the far south of the territory.
Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said yesterday that troops were “fighting in the southern Gaza Strip in the area of Khan Yunis, and we have expanded the combat to the area known as the central camps”.
Three more Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza yesterday, bringing the total to 161 since its ground invasion began on 27 October, the military said.
The UN Human Rights Office said it was “gravely concerned about the continued bombardment of Middle Gaza by Israeli forces”, particularly after the military ordered residents to move to the central and southern regions.
France, a staunch Israeli ally, also said it was concerned by Israel’s vow to intensify and prolong the fighting.
Violence has also flared across the occupied West Bank since the war began.
An Israeli operation in a refugee camp in the north of the West Bank left six people dead early this morning, according to the Palestinian ministry of health.
More than 300 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers since the war erupted, according to the ministry.
The impacts of the war have also reverberated throughout the region, with armed groups backed by Israel’s arch-foe Iran escalating activity.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said today that there was “no difference” between Benjamin Netanyahu and Adolf Hitler as he stepped up his attacks on the Israeli leader.
“There is no difference between the actions of Netanyahu and Hitler,” he said during a ceremony in the capital Ankara.
“He (Netanyahu) is richer than Hitler. All kind of support comes from the West and the United States,” Erdogan added.
The Turkish leader has lashed out repeatedly at Israel for the scale of death and destruction caused by its retaliation for the 7 October attacks.
He has branded Israel a “terrorist state”, Netanyahu “the butcher of Gaza” while calling Hamas “a liberation group”.
US military forces shot down more than a dozen attack drones and several missiles fired by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels at shipping in the Red Sea, the Pentagon said, reporting no damage or injuries.
The Houthis had claimed a missile strike on a vessel in the Red Sea and a drone attack towards Israel, their latest such actions in solidarity with Gaza.
Israel’s military said one of its fighter jets had intercepted “in the Red Sea area a hostile aerial target that was on its way to Israeli territory”.
Egyptian broadcaster Al-Qahera News reported that a flying object was struck about two kilometres from the seaside town of Dahab. The town lies around 125 kilometres south of Eilat on the southern tip of Israel, the closest target for Yemen’s rebels.
In Iraq, the US military launched strikes on pro-Iran groups it has blamed for numerous attacks on US and allied forces during the Israel-Hamas war.
The strike claimed at least one life, Iraqi authorities said.
An anti-tank missile fired by Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement wounded nine soldiers, Israel’s military said, while Hezbollah announced the death of two of its fighters.
The incidents come after an Israeli strike in Syria killed Razi Moussavi, a senior commander in the Quds Force – the foreign arm of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
The IRGC warned Israel today that it or its allied groups would take “direct” action to avenge the killing of senior commander Razi Moussavi.
The general was killed on Monday near the Syrian capital Damascus, according to state media.
The Israeli army, which has launched hundreds of strikes on Iran-linked targets in war-torn Syria in recent years, said that it does not comment on foreign media reports.

"Tom Clonan 
 Israel is fast losing international credibility and support over its crimes in Gaza","THE ISRAELI DEFENCE Forces (IDF) have been engaged in their ground invasion of the Gaza Strip for almost two months now. Israel’s stated war aim is to ‘destroy’ Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu has stated ‘If you want peace, destroy Hamas. If you want security, destroy Hamas. If you want a future for Israel, the Palestinians, the Middle East, destroy Hamas’.
After two months of combat, the IDF claim that they have ‘eliminated’ 6,000 Hamas fighters. This leaves an estimated 24,000 Hamas terrorists active within the Gaza Strip. Israel has not managed to apprehend any of the leadership of Hamas. Mohammed Deif and Yahya Sinwar remain at large.
Hamas continues to commit war crimes. As I write, on one day alone, Hamas has carried out 11 separate missile and drone attacks at civilian targets. To be clear. Both sides in this appalling conflictare committing war crimes. Hamas’ targeting of civilians is a war crime. Hamas’ use of civilian objects and Palestinian civilians as ‘human shields’ are war crimes. Hamas’ continued holding of Israeli hostages – with the explicit threat to execute them – is a gross violation of the laws of armed conflict.
Civilians, including children, are pulled from the rubble after Israeli attacks every day in Gaza.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
Israel is also committing war crimes in Gaza. Israel’s breaches of the Geneva Conventions are egregious. As an invading force, the IDF have significant responsibilities under the laws of armed conflict. Under the 4th Geneva Convention, Article 17, the IDF are obliged to ‘remove from besieged or encircled areas of wounded, sick, infirm and aged persons, children and maternity cases’.
Instead, Israel and the IDF have corralled and trapped 2.2 million Palestinian civilians into a free-fire zone within the confines of the Gaza Strip. At first, the IDF ordered a mass evacuation and expulsion of civilians out of Gaza City south to Khan Younis and Rafah. Contrary to Article 15 of the Geneva Convention – the Israelis did not provide ‘neutralised zones’ or safe passage for these civilians.
Having directed these civilians – under direct and indirect fire – to evacuate to Khan Younis and Rafah, the IDF then began attacking these cities with artillery, missile and air strikes. Thus far, Israel has fired at least 30,000 separate items of military ordnance on Gaza. That is one heavy weapon fired into a densely populated urban environment every three minutes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for 60 days.
As a consequence, over 20,000 Palestinian men, women and children have been killed by high explosives – shock wave injuries including limb separation and decapitation, accompanied by horrific shrapnel injuries and burns. Almost 10,000 children have been killed in this way. In the obscene calculus of indiscriminate and disproportionate – criminal – use of force by the IDF, that means that over 160 children are killed each day. As 2023 comes to a close, that is the equivalent of one child killed in Gaza every ten minutes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Gaza has now been determined as the most dangerous place in the world for children, according to theUnited Nations.

Israel’s use of these weapon systems – and the sheer weight of fire from the IDF in their ground operations – are in clear breach of Article 51 of the Geneva Conventions which prohibit the use of weapon systems or a ‘method of attack’ where there is a ‘concentration of civilians or civilian objects’.
By closing their border crossings and refusing civilians the opportunity to flee or evacuate from Gaza – the Israeli government has effectively created a concentration zone or ghetto within the Gaza Strip that is ‘uninhabitable’ according to the UN.
Like President Assad’s use of indiscriminate ‘barrel bombs’ to target civilians in besieged Syrian towns – Netanyahu’s government has sanctioned a level of force, coupled with the concentrated confinement of civilians thatmany believeis consistent with mass murder. The IDF’s behaviour is has beencalled genocidal. These concerns have been raised consistently at theUnited Nations.

What has happened in Gaza is difficult to fully comprehend in terms of its brutality. It is reminiscent of the ‘total war’ concept employed by the axis powers during World War Two. The UN Works Relief Agency in Gaza (UNWRA) has stated that in two months, 66% of Gaza’s physical infrastructure has been completely destroyed.
The IDF has also specifically targeted protected structures such as schools and hospitals. According to the UN, 300 medical personnel have been killed during IDF offensive operations. Almost 100 journalists have been killed. The actions of the IDF are almost unprecedented – not only in brutality but in the sheer scale of the killing. Israel’s actions, in my view, match the definitions contained within the Geneva Conventions of ‘wanton destruction’ and ‘wilful killing’.
The targeting of hospitals has led to the killing of children – amputees recovering from surgery for life altering injuries. Such savagery is reminiscent of the worst excesses of axis forces in Asia, central Europe and eastern Europe during World War Two.
As I write this review of combat operations in the Gaza Strip, the IDF have repeatedly targeted refugee camps such as Jabaila in the north of Gaza and Nasser hospital in the south – resulting in mass casualties. The Medecines Sans Frontieres Team Leader in Gaza, Chris Hook has described the conditions under which doctors are working ‘Doctors are stepping over bodies of dead children to treat other children who will die anyway’.
Their actions are those of a rogue state and represent an act of collective self-harm for Israel. Their military actions have not destroyed Hamas. Nor will they. Not one killing of an innocent Palestinian civilian will bring Israel the security and safety it deserves as a sovereign state.
The mass killing of innocent Gazans – if continued into 2024 – will ultimately serve to sow the seeds of Israel’s own destruction. Netanyahu has already sought to erode the separation of powers in Israel’s democratic structures. His illegal prosecution of the war against Gaza further erodes the legitimacy of the Israeli state.

An enduring and full ceasefire is essential to prevent a wider escalation of the War in Gaza. If there is no permanent ceasefire – on both sides – tens of thousands more Palestinians will be killed in the first few months of 2024. With inadequate aid – food, medical and water supplies – allowed into Gaza, human life will not be viable within the Gaza Strip. According to UNICEF spokesperson, James Elder:
History clearly demonstrates that nation states who rely upon indiscriminate violence and a permanent war footing for survival ultimately fail. Netanyahu’s toxic rhetoric on the use of force – echoed and parroted by his security advisor Mark Regev and his IDF male and female spokespersons – belong to a previous century and previous conflicts. As the unlawful killing of each Palestinian child is recorded and uploaded to the digital space – Israel will fall further into disrepute.
In the last two years, the EU, NATO and the US have taken a stand against the criminal aggression of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. Western leaders have repeatedly spoken of the rules-based world order and the value system we must defend in the face of brute force and war crimes.

The same solidarity and ethical resolve must apply in the case of the war crimes of Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Any humanitarian ceasefire must be a permanent suspension of violence from all parties.
Both the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Michéal Martin have demonstrated moral courage in their condemnation of those war crimes committed in Gaza – on all sides. We must continue to do everything in our power in 2024 to prevent a regional escalation of the current conflict to a second front in Lebanon and a proxy war with Iran.
Global conflict – along with the threat accelerator of climate change — will continue to present Ireland with significant challenges in 2024 and the coming years. The key to survival will be independent and neutral — courageous and ethical — leadership.

Department of Foreign Affairs assists 57 Irish citizens and dependents in leaving Gaza to date,"THE DEPARTMENT of foreign affairs has assisted 57 Irish citizens and their dependents in leaving Gaza to date since 7 October.
Since the Hamas attacks of 7 October, a dedicated crisis team within the DFA with officers in Dublin, the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv, Ramallah in the West Bank, and the Egyptian capital Cairo have been responding to the ongoing conflict.
The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened on 1 November to allow foreigners and dual nationals to flee the besieged region.
It was the first time Egypt had opened the Rafah crossing since the Israel-Hamas conflict began on 7 October.
It wasn’t until two weeks later, on 15 November, when the first group of Irish citizens and their dependents were able to leave Gaza.
Speaking at the time, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said there was no indication that Ireland was penalised in the evacuations for its stance on the conflict between Israel and Hamas.
In a statement today upon the release of the 2023 Consular Assistance Overview, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it continues to advise against all travel to Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories and to Lebanon.
As well as assisting 57 citizens and dependents to leave Gaza to date,the Department also worked to secure the release of nine-year-old Emily Hand.
Emily had been on a sleepover in the Kibbutz Be’eri where she lived, when it was raided by Hamas.
Her father, originally from Dun Laoghaire in Dublin, was initially told she had died in the attack.
Upon her release, President Michael D Higgins said he hopes Emily can now “despite all that she has endured, enjoy a happy and fulfilling life”.

Higgins noted that the release of Emily to her family had been a priority of the Government in their diplomatic efforts, adding that he thought it was important to recognise the work of the team.
In all, the Department provided consular assistance to 2,043 new cases so far this year.
This included work in April following the outbreak of conflict in Sudan.
A dedicated crisis team based in Dublin and the Irish Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, was established within the Department.
This team facilitated the evacuation of over 280 Irish citizens and dependents from Sudan between 15 April and 25 May.
Excluding crises related cases in Sudan and the Middle East, this year has seen a 13% increase in newly-recorded consular cases.
Meanwhile, the Department noted that a number of citizens continue to enter Ukraine.
A spokesperson said: “The situation across Ukraine remains extremely dangerous, the Department strongly advises against all travel to Ukraine, for any purpose.
“The capacity of the Department to provide consular assistance in Ukraine is extremely limited.”
There was also a 12% year-on-year increase in deaths of Irish citizens abroad notified to the Department, with 381 to date – more than one-in-five of all new consular cases in 2023 related to the death of an Irish citizen overseas.
The Department was also notified of the deaths of a number of Irish citizens as a result of medical and/or cosmetic procedures abroad.
Commenting on the Consular Assistance Overview, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said the “statistics show a consistently high level of demand for our services”.
He added that in response to the increasing demand for consular assistance, the Department haslaunched an updated Consular Assistance Charter, which he said “sets out clearly the support the Department can and cannot provide”.

"Gaza population in 'grave peril' due to acute hunger, says World Health Organisation","
THE POPULATION OF Gaza is in “grave peril”, the head of the World Health Organisation today warned, citing acute hunger and desperation throughout the war-torn Palestinian territory.
The WHO said it delivered supplies to two hospitals yesterday, with only 15 out of 36 hospitals in the Gaza Strip functioning with any capacity at all.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on the international community to take “urgent steps to alleviate the grave peril facing the population of Gaza and jeopardising the ability of humanitarian workers to help people with terrible injuries, acute hunger, and at severe risk of disease”.
In a statement, the WHO said its staff reported that “hungry people again stopped our convoys today in the hope of finding food”.
“WHO’s ability to supply medicines, medical supplies, and fuel to hospitals is being increasingly constrained by the hunger and desperation of people en route to, and within, hospitals we reach.”
The bloodiest-ever Gaza war erupted when Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October and killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
They took 250 hostages, of whom 129 remain inside Gaza, according to Israeli officials, in the worst attack in the country’s history.
Israel launched extensive aerial bombardment and a siege followed by a ground invasion.
The campaign has killed at least 21,110 people, mostly women and children, according to Hamas-run Gaza’s health ministry.
“The safety of our staff and continuity of operations depends on more food arriving in all of Gaza, immediately,” Tedros said.
Last week’s United Nations Security Council resolution called for the “safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale” – but did not call for an immediate end to fighting.

Tedros said the resolution “appeared to provide hope of an improvement in humanitarian aid distribution within Gaza.
“However, based on WHO eyewitness accounts on the ground, the resolution is tragically yet to have an impact.
“What we urgently need, right now, is a ceasefire to spare civilians from further violence and begin the long road towards reconstruction and peace.”
WHO teams visited two hospitals yesterday – Al-Shifa in the north and Al-Amal Palestine Red Crescent Society in the south – to deliver supplies and assess the needs on the ground.
It said a reported 50,000 people were seeking refuge at Al-Shifa, with 14,000 sheltering at Al-Amal.
“At Al-Amal, colleagues saw the aftermath of recent strikes that disabled the hospital’s radio tower and impacted the central ambulance dispatch system for the entire Khan Yunis area affecting more than 1.5 million people,” the WHO said.
Only five of its nine ambulances are still operational, while WHO staff said it was “impossible” to walk through the hospital “without stepping over patients and those seeking refuge”.
While transiting across Gaza, WHO staff saw “tens of thousands of people” on the move, on foot, on donkeys or in cars.
“WHO is extremely concerned this fresh displacement of people will further strain health facilities in the south, which are already struggling,” said Rik Peeperkorn, the UN health agency’s representative in the Palestinian territories.
“This forced mass movement of people will also lead to more overcrowding, increased risk of infectious diseases, and make it even harder to deliver humanitarian aid.”
According to the latest WHO assessments, Gaza has 13 partially functioning hospitals, two minimally functioning ones, and 21 that are not functioning at all.

Taoiseach: Robbie Keane's decision to coach Israeli football club is ‘a matter for him’,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that Robbie Keane’s job with Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv is “a matter for him”, amid some criticism of Ireland’s record goalscorer from supporters of Palestine.
The former international has been the club’s head coach since June this year.
In October, Israel launched a military operation and bombardment against Gaza in response to an attack by Hamas militants that saw 1,200 people killed and more than 200 others taken hostage.

The war has devastated large parts of the densely populated enclave, killing more than 20,400 Palestinians and displacing almost all of the territory’s 2.3 million people.
The Irish government has been vocal in calling for a ceasefire and Foreign Affairs Minister Micheal Martin said ahead of the Christmas break that Ireland believed Israel had “exceeded” the proportionality limit in its response to the Hamas attack on 7 October.
Asked during an end-of-year interview about Keane’s position in coaching the Israeli side during the war, Varadkar did not weigh in on the issue.
“I think primarily that’s a matter for him,” he said.
“He was offered a job and he’s taken it up in Tel Aviv. I suppose… There are a lot of very good people in Israel who want there to be peace, who want justice for Palestinians, who want there to be a two-state solution.

“That used to be the majority, they are now the minority.
“I think they can be the majority again and I’m not convinced that demonising and ostracising an entire country, and entire nation of people, is actually the best way to achieve what we are trying to achieve.”
Asked if he should consider his coaching position, Varadkar said: “I think it’s up to him, I’m not calling on him to consider his position at all.”

UN 'gravely concerned' by Israeli strikes on central Gaza as Netanyahu doubles down,"LAST UPDATE|26 Dec 2023

ISRAEL HAS KEPT up its strikes against Gaza targets despite grave concern expressed by the United Nations, and international calls for a halt to the Israel-Hamas war.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again vowed there would be no peace until the destruction of Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules Gaza, and the military said the war would last months
Israel’s army said it struck military sites and tunnel shafts in Jabalia, northern Gaza, as well as in Khan Yunis in the south, as heavy ground combat continued.
Black smoke clouded the sky over central Gaza this afternoon and, in the south, horse-drawn carts carried some victims to hospital in Khan Yunis, AFP images showed.
The withering military campaign in Gaza, launched after unprecedented Hamas attacks against southern Israeli communities on October 7, has caused mass civilian casualties, widespread hunger and reduced much of the coastal territory to rubble.

Internet and telephone services were again cut across the Palestinian territory, “due to the ongoing offensive,” announced Gaza’s main telecoms firm, Paltel.
“We are gravely concerned about the continued bombardment of Middle Gaza by Israeli forces,” Seif Magango, spokesman for the United Nations Human Rights Office, said in a statement.
Netanyahu, however, reiterated Israel would stay the course.
“Hamas must be destroyed, Gaza must be demilitarised and Palestinian society must be deradicalised,” he argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published yesterday.
“These are the three prerequisites for peace”, he wrote.
Israel’s army chief Herzi Halevi today told a news conference that the war “will continue for many more months”, a point made earlier this month by Defence Minister Yoav Gallant who said “it will last more than several months”.
The bloodiest ever Gaza war erupted when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel and killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
They took 250 hostages of whom 129 remain inside Gaza, Israel says.
Israel retaliated with a relentless bombardment and a siege followed by a ground invasion. The campaign has killed at least 20,915 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll issued Tuesday by Gaza’s health ministry.
The army says 158 Israeli soldiers have been killed inside Gaza.
AFPTV images from Gaza City’s devastated and largely deserted Tal al-Hawa area showed dirt roads winding through mountains of rubble amid multi-storey buildings pancaked by strikes or standing askew.
“The destruction is very great, and all the owners of the place have been displaced to the south,” said one Palestinian man. “May God help people through the misfortunes they are in.”

Some residents of Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza returned to the ruins of their homes after strikes that Gaza’s health ministry said killed at least 70 people. AFP was unable to independently verify that toll.
Sean Casey, a World Health Organization Emergency Medical Teams coordinator, was part of a WHO mission to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah city after the refugee camp strikes.
In a video shot inside the hospital, Casey appeared to be fighting back tears as he described a nine-year-old boy, Ahmed, “being treated basically with sedation to ease his suffering as he dies”, after receiving a head wound when a building was struck.
Only a minority of Gaza’s hospitals are even partly functioning, says the WHO, whose Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus repeated his “call for an immediate ceasefire”.
The Israeli army said it was “reviewing the incident” at Al-Maghazi and added it is “committed to international law including taking feasible steps to minimise harm to civilians”.
Israel has been under increasing pressure from its allies to protect non-combatants.
Gaza’s 2.4 million people are enduring dire shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine, with only limited aid entering.
An estimated 1.9 million Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN, many having fled south.
Netanyahu told members of his conservative Likud party on Monday that he was ready to support the voluntary migration of civilians out of the Gaza Strip, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.
He reportedly told party members “our problem is not whether to allow an exit, but that there will be countries that are willing to absorb an exit”.
In a statement, Hamas rejected as “absurd” any such discussion. “There can’t be exile and there is no other choice than to remain on our land.”
United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the idea of pushing Palestinians into Egypt “is a nonstarter”.
Blinken was meeting on Tuesday with Israel’s Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan “for face-to-face consultations on a number of matters related to the conflict in Gaza and the return of hostages held by Hamas”, National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.
The war has stoked regional tensions.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said an Israeli air strike in Syria killed the senior Quds Force commander Razi Moussavi. President Ebrahim Raisi vowed Israel “will certainly pay for this crime”.
Explosions were heard and missiles sighted near a vessel transiting the Red Sea off Yemen’s port of Hodeida, which is controlled by Iran-backed rebels, the Royal Navy’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said, reporting the latest incident in the waterway vital for global trade.
In Iraq, the US military launched strikes on pro-Iran groups it has blamed for numerous attacks on US and allied forces since the Israel-Hamas war began. The strike claimed at least one life, according to Iraqi authorities.
An anti-tank missile fired by Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement wounded nine soldiers as they rescued a civilian injured in another cross-border strike, Israel’s military said.
Violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where two Palestinians were killed on Tuesday.

"Tom Clonan 
 Israel is fast losing international credibility and support over its crimes in Gaza","THE ISRAELI DEFENCE Forces (IDF) have been engaged in their ground invasion of the Gaza Strip for almost two months now. Israel’s stated war aim is to ‘destroy’ Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu has stated ‘If you want peace, destroy Hamas. If you want security, destroy Hamas. If you want a future for Israel, the Palestinians, the Middle East, destroy Hamas’.
After two months of combat, the IDF claim that they have ‘eliminated’ 6,000 Hamas fighters. This leaves an estimated 24,000 Hamas terrorists active within the Gaza Strip. Israel has not managed to apprehend any of the leadership of Hamas. Mohammed Deif and Yahya Sinwar remain at large.
Hamas continues to commit war crimes. As I write, on one day alone, Hamas has carried out 11 separate missile and drone attacks at civilian targets. To be clear. Both sides in this appalling conflictare committing war crimes. Hamas’ targeting of civilians is a war crime. Hamas’ use of civilian objects and Palestinian civilians as ‘human shields’ are war crimes. Hamas’ continued holding of Israeli hostages – with the explicit threat to execute them – is a gross violation of the laws of armed conflict.

Israel is also committing war crimes in Gaza. Israel’s breaches of the Geneva Conventions are egregious. As an invading force, the IDF have significant responsibilities under the laws of armed conflict. Under the 4th Geneva Convention, Article 17, the IDF are obliged to ‘remove from besieged or encircled areas of wounded, sick, infirm and aged persons, children and maternity cases’.
Instead, Israel and the IDF have corralled and trapped 2.2 million Palestinian civilians into a free-fire zone within the confines of the Gaza Strip. At first, the IDF ordered a mass evacuation and expulsion of civilians out of Gaza City south to Khan Younis and Rafah. Contrary to Article 15 of the Geneva Convention – the Israelis did not provide ‘neutralised zones’ or safe passage for these civilians.
Having directed these civilians – under direct and indirect fire – to evacuate to Khan Younis and Rafah, the IDF then began attacking these cities with artillery, missile and air strikes. Thus far, Israel has fired at least 30,000 separate items of military ordnance on Gaza. That is one heavy weapon fired into a densely populated urban environment every three minutes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for 60 days.
As a consequence, over 20,000 Palestinian men, women and children have been killed by high explosives – shock wave injuries including limb separation and decapitation, accompanied by horrific shrapnel injuries and burns. Almost 10,000 children have been killed in this way. In the obscene calculus of indiscriminate and disproportionate – criminal – use of force by the IDF, that means that over 160 children are killed each day. As 2023 comes to a close, that is the equivalent of one child killed in Gaza every ten minutes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Gaza has now been determined as the most dangerous place in the world for children, according to theUnited Nations.

Israel’s use of these weapon systems – and the sheer weight of fire from the IDF in their ground operations – are in clear breach of Article 51 of the Geneva Conventions which prohibit the use of weapon systems or a ‘method of attack’ where there is a ‘concentration of civilians or civilian objects’.
By closing their border crossings and refusing civilians the opportunity to flee or evacuate from Gaza – the Israeli government has effectively created a concentration zone or ghetto within the Gaza Strip that is ‘uninhabitable’ according to the UN.
Like President Assad’s use of indiscriminate ‘barrel bombs’ to target civilians in besieged Syrian towns – Netanyahu’s government has sanctioned a level of force, coupled with the concentrated confinement of civilians thatmany believeis consistent with mass murder. The IDF’s behaviour is has beencalled genocidal. These concerns have been raised consistently at theUnited Nations.

What has happened in Gaza is difficult to fully comprehend in terms of its brutality. It is reminiscent of the ‘total war’ concept employed by the axis powers during World War Two. The UN Works Relief Agency in Gaza (UNWRA) has stated that in two months, 66% of Gaza’s physical infrastructure has been completely destroyed.
The IDF has also specifically targeted protected structures such as schools and hospitals. According to the UN, 300 medical personnel have been killed during IDF offensive operations. Almost 100 journalists have been killed. The actions of the IDF are almost unprecedented – not only in brutality but in the sheer scale of the killing. Israel’s actions, in my view, match the definitions contained within the Geneva Conventions of ‘wanton destruction’ and ‘wilful killing’.
The targeting of hospitals has led to the killing of children – amputees recovering from surgery for life altering injuries. Such savagery is reminiscent of the worst excesses of axis forces in Asia, central Europe and eastern Europe during World War Two.
As I write this review of combat operations in the Gaza Strip, the IDF have repeatedly targeted refugee camps such as Jabaila in the north of Gaza and Nasser hospital in the south – resulting in mass casualties. The Medecines Sans Frontieres Team Leader in Gaza, Chris Hook has described the conditions under which doctors are working ‘Doctors are stepping over bodies of dead children to treat other children who will die anyway’.
Their actions are those of a rogue state and represent an act of collective self-harm for Israel. Their military actions have not destroyed Hamas. Nor will they. Not one killing of an innocent Palestinian civilian will bring Israel the security and safety it deserves as a sovereign state.
The mass killing of innocent Gazans – if continued into 2024 – will ultimately serve to sow the seeds of Israel’s own destruction. Netanyahu has already sought to erode the separation of powers in Israel’s democratic structures. His illegal prosecution of the war against Gaza further erodes the legitimacy of the Israeli state.

An enduring and full ceasefire is essential to prevent a wider escalation of the War in Gaza. If there is no permanent ceasefire – on both sides – tens of thousands more Palestinians will be killed in the first few months of 2024. With inadequate aid – food, medical and water supplies – allowed into Gaza, human life will not be viable within the Gaza Strip. According to UNICEF spokesperson, James Elder:
History clearly demonstrates that nation states who rely upon indiscriminate violence and a permanent war footing for survival ultimately fail. Netanyahu’s toxic rhetoric on the use of force – echoed and parroted by his security advisor Mark Regev and his IDF male and female spokespersons – belong to a previous century and previous conflicts. As the unlawful killing of each Palestinian child is recorded and uploaded to the digital space – Israel will fall further into disrepute.
In the last two years, the EU, NATO and the US have taken a stand against the criminal aggression of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. Western leaders have repeatedly spoken of the rules-based world order and the value system we must defend in the face of brute force and war crimes.
Netanyahu and Biden.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
The same solidarity and ethical resolve must apply in the case of the war crimes of Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Any humanitarian ceasefire must be a permanent suspension of violence from all parties.
Both the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Michéal Martin have demonstrated moral courage in their condemnation of those war crimes committed in Gaza – on all sides. We must continue to do everything in our power in 2024 to prevent a regional escalation of the current conflict to a second front in Lebanon and a proxy war with Iran.
Global conflict – along with the threat accelerator of climate change — will continue to present Ireland with significant challenges in 2024 and the coming years. The key to survival will be independent and neutral — courageous and ethical — leadership.

McDonald not in favour of boycotting St Patrick's Day White House over US Middle East policy,"SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has said she would not be in favour of boycotting the St Patrick’s Day visit to the White House over US support for Israel’s offensive in Gaza.
Speaking toThe Journal, McDonald said she has spoken to the US Ambassador Clare Cronin and other US representatives about where Sinn Féin stands on the issue.
When asked if the situation carries on into the new year, and the US continues its support for Israel’s bombardment of Palestine, would she be supportive of calls to boycott the traditional St Patrick’s Day visit to Washington DC, she said:
“I think you need to be very careful about any idea of boycotting, the Irish relationship with the United States is a very long standing one, a very valuable one, on many, many dimensions.
“I don’t think boycotting an event like that would resolve the issue at hand in the Middle East.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is due to make the trip stateside next March for the St Patrick’s Day celebrations. McDonaldalso travels to the US and Washington DCannually to mark the event.
Her comments come after anumber of politicians boycotted a dinnerat the US ambassador’s residence over the country’s backing of Israel’s attacks on Gaza.
“I think we need to be clear that that relationship for us is valuable, not least in terms of the evolution of our own peace process. But I certainly accept, and I have no doubt that the American system, if you listen to President Biden recently, he has acknowledged himself that Israel has lost the world. They have lost world opinion, for the simple reason that that no reasoned person, irrespective of the political spectrum they’re on, could witness that. Just stop, this has to stop.
“So I don’t think anybody should imagine that anybody in the American system is in any way confused about the Sinn Féin stance as regards Palestine, or indeed the Irish stance, the Irish public opinion on Palestine. And it’s interesting, if you look stateside, it’s different now. American public opinion is in a different place than it would have been saying a decade ago on this on this question,” said the Dublin Central TD.
McDonald said she spoke to the US ambassador to Ireland “quite recently” and other US officials where “the issue of Palestine did come up”.

“They know full well our analysis. I’m not shy about sharing it with them… America is very much on the right side of things in terms of the Irish peace process. I would like to see the United States very much on the right side of building peace in the Middle East,” she said.
McDonald said the scale of the onslaught on the people of Gaza has been “absolutely horrifying”.
“I mean, they are pulverising Gaza. It’s televised, it’s happening before our eyes, and it’s very difficult for me to kind of reconcile how anybody with influence or authority or power, could stand in the way of a ceasefire, this is what we should all be pressing for. And by and large, it is what the world is calling for.”
She acknowledged that the Irish government is working with other EU countries, like the Spanish and Belgians to try and push the European position.
“I think Ursula von der Leyen, when she gave the green light to Israel, I think people were horrified by that,” she said.
As president of the European Commission von der Leyen was quick to pledge support to Israel, despite concerns that the country’s response to the 7 October Hamas attacks would have catastrophic impacts for Gaza’s civilian population.
“The European Union stands with Israel,” she wrote on X, formerly Twitter, the day Hamas attacked civilians and captured hostages, alongside a picture of theEuropean Commission headquarters lit up with the Israeli flag.
On 13 October von der Leyen visited Israel to express solidarity.
By the following day von der Leyen appeared to be feeling the pressure, issuing her first statement to acknowledge the threat to Gaza’s civilians. In it she announced that the EU would be tripling its humanitarian aid.
“There is no justification for Hamas’ heinous act of terror,” she wrote in a social media post. “Israel has the right to defend itself. At the same time civilians in Gaza are also victims of Hamas.”
The majority of Irish MEPshave accused the Commission President of overstepping her mandate.
McDonald said the tweet sent by the Commission president “gave people a pause for thought”, particularly when there is an ongoing discussion about Ireland’s neutrality.

"Boycotting the Eurovision over Israel's involvement would alienate people, says Taoiseach","BOTH THE TAOISEACH and Tánaiste have said they oppose a boycott of the Eurovision over Israel’s involvement, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar arguing it would only alienate Israel’s liberal community.
The Tánaiste, on the other hand, said if Ireland chose to boycott the song contest this year it could prove “counterproductive”.
Speaking toThe Journalin a pre-Christmas press conference, the Taoiseach said he does not believe a boycott of any sporting event, musical event or competition is the right way to go.
Hundreds of emails have been sent to RTÉ calling on it to boycott the 2024 Eurovision due to Israel’s involvement.
Israel is expected, as usual, to take part in the contest – but the campaign to launch an Irish boycott gathered paceafter official confirmation recently of the 37 countries to take part in next year’s contest in the Swedish city of Malmo.
“It’s one thing for a country to be excluded from a competition, whether it’s a music competition or a sports competition, and we have seen for example, Russia excluded from some competitions.
“But for us to unilaterally boycott something, to remove ourselves from a competition…just because Israel is there, to me that’s biting off your nose to spite your face,” he said.
The Taoiseach said all a boycott serves to do is exclude our own musicians.
The Eurovision Song Contest is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
In 2022, the EBU excluded Russia from the competition due to its invasion of Ukraine.
The Taoiseach said while Israel’s involvement in this year’s competition is a decision for the EBU, he cautioned against exclusion.
“Israel is a country of about 9 million people now. That includes 2 million Arabs, Christians, Palestinians. It also includes a lot of people in Israel who are liberals, who do not necessarily support their government, who would like to see a two-state solution.
“The difficulty I think with boycotts is that you can end up ostracising and alienating the people who we actually need to engage with,” the Taoiseach said.
“And let’s not forget that one of the previous winners of the Eurovision was a trans woman, Dana International and there’s a whole society of people in Israel, particularly in Tel Aviv and other places that are liberals, that have a Western liberal outlook,” he added.
Dana International, a trans woman, who won the Eurovision for Israel in 1998 was heralded for bringing trans identity into the mainstream.
The Taoiseach said we need to have regard to the possibility that by ostracising, demonising or excluding Israel from international life “we might actually make it harder for them to make the case for peace”.
Tánaiste Micheál Martin agreed with this sentiment.
He said he could understand why some people might call for a boycott, but he did not feel it would have any impact on the situation in Gaza.
“I understand why people would call for that and feel they must look at every opportunity, but in terms of its impact I’m not clear that it would have any impact,” he said, stating “there’s a much greater complexity to this issue than is sometimes given credence”.

“I think my own assessment right now, it could potentially have a counterproductive impact,” said Martin to reporters at a roundtable interview in Dublin.
Martin said he had not give consideration to whether Ireland should participate in a boycott, stating that his focus has been on using the bodies and forums available to persuade Israel to stop the war on Gaza.
“I’m not clear that boycotting will create that result,” he said.
In the weeks before Christmas the vast majority of countries in the EU reached the position Ireland has held for some time now, that there is a need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
“So persistence, in terms of the various fora that we’re members of, can bring results,” Martin said, although he accepted that progress has been made slowly.
He added:
His comments come as Labour TD Aodhán Ó Ríordáin has called on RTÉ to pull out of next year’s Eurovision.
Speaking to Newstalk recently, he said:
“If the Eurovision doesn’t happen because of Israel’s participation then so be it.
“I think in years to come when the history of this conflict is being written, we want a little asterisk beside our name as a country that was different.”
The Tánaiste argues that “sustained pressure” at EU and United Nations level is needed, stating that the manner in which Ireland has approached the issue is more effective in “winning people around to the argument”.
“My only hope is that coming out of all of this, that we do get a political pathway… I am very clear that we need to maintain the focus on the real challenges. Diplomacy is the only way we’re going to get this brought to an end.
“And that’s working with our neighbouring states in the Middle East also. But what’s critical is an immediate ceasefire now, to be followed up by a very serious substantive political action with a view to getting a pathway to a political solution, which ultimately has to be the two state solution,” he concluded.
A template email calling for the boycott, that has been seen byThe Journal, claims that “Israel’s participation in the contest next year brings the entire competition into disrepute”.
It also noted that Russia was excluded from the competition due to the invasion of Ukraine after the Eurovision organisers said thatto do otherwise would “bring the competition into disrepute”.
In the immediate aftermath of the 2022 Ukraine invasion, the EBU said it was “monitoring the situation” and that Russia remained in that year’s competition.
That decision was reversed within 24 hours however.
As EBU boss and former RTÉ director general Noel Curran explained in an interviewwithThe Journalat that year’s song contest, “it was pretty clear to us that we wouldn’t be able to have Russia take part”.
The EBU toldThe Journalthat Israel would be taking part, saying the country’s participation was confirmed by the executive board.
The EBU also said the decision to exclude Russia last year was made by governing bodies of the organisation.
“The Eurovision Song Contest remains a non-political event that unites audiences worldwide through music,” it added.

Israel continues to strike Gaza after UN Security Council demands aid be rushed in 'at scale',"LAST UPDATE|23 Dec 2023

ISRAEL HAS PRESSED its Gaza offensive today, with Hamas reporting heavy shelling in several cities hours after world powers demanded more aid be allowed into the besieged Palestinian territory.
Clouds of grey and black smoke rose over the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis after strikes in the morning.
The Gaza health ministry reported 18 people killed in a strike on a house in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, and said other targets were hit up and down the coastal Gaza Strip.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on today that at least 20,258 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory since the start of war with Israel on October 7.
The latest toll includes 201 fatalities in the past 24 hours, the ministry said. Most of the dead are women and children.
The bombardments came after the UN Security Council approved a resolution demanding “immediate, safe and unhindered” deliveries of life-saving aid be rushed to Gaza “at scale”. Members had wrangled for days over the wording.
At Washington’s insistence, they toned down some provisions and avoided calling for a ceasefire that would stop the war, which began with unprecedented attacks 11 weeks ago by Hamas militants on civilians in southern Israel.
It is still unclear what, if any, impact the vote will have on the ground, where Gazans have been forced into crowded shelters or tents, and are struggling to find food, fuel, water and medical care.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a “humanitarian ceasefire” is the only way for aid “to be effectively delivered”.
The issue was not the number of aid trucks, he said, but “the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles” to aid distribution.
Immediately after the UN vote, Israel again vowed to fight on until Hamas is “eliminated” and hostages are freed.
“Israel will continue the war in Gaza,” said Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, insisting the war was legal and just.
Fighting began on 7 October when Hamas gunmen broke through Gaza’s border and killed about 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.

Palestinian militants also abducted about 250 people, 129 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched a relentless bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, where 20,057 people have been killed, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas government.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
Allies, including the United States which provides Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, have increasingly pressured Israel to avoid civilian casualties.

Israel insists Hamas is to blame for mass civilian deaths, accusing the Islamists of using innocent Palestinians as “human shields” and operating out of hospitals, schools and UN facilities.
A report by Washington’s Director of National Intelligence, quoted this month by US media, said nearly half of munitions dropped by Israeli aircraft on Gaza were “dumb” bombs – less accurate unguided munitions. Israeli air force officers have disputed this.
Photos approved for release by Israel’s army show soldiers operating in a wasteland of rubble where fires burn.
The UN estimates the fighting has displaced 1.9 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million population.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a majority of those uprooted from their homes were now going “entire days and nights without eating”, and “famine is looming”.
A one-week truce that Qatar helped mediate, with support from Egypt and the US, ended on 1 December. It saw 80 Israeli hostages released from Gaza captivity in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
Israel has repeatedly told Palestinians to make their way to areas in the narrow Gaza Strip it says are safe, but even when they do, residents say they have still been bombarded.
Many Gazans have been forced to move multiple times.
Yesterday, thousands fled central Gaza after an army evacuation order. It warned residents of Bureij, a refugee camp established about 70 years ago, to move “for their own security” towards Deir al-Balah city further south.
Donkey carts creaked with their belongings as they passed through the streets. Families pushed babies in prams and led elderly relatives through the crowd, packing winter blankets for the road ahead.

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said the latest evacuation order would effect more than 150,000 people.
“The Israeli army just orders people to move into areas where there are ongoing air strikes,” Thomas White, UNRWA’s Gaza director, wrote on social media.

Yesterday’s UN resolution only passed thanks to US and Russian abstentions. It gives the UN a bigger role in coordinating the delivery of aid to Gaza.
But Israel’s foreign minister insisted his country “will continue to screen all humanitarian aid to Gaza for security reasons”.
Hamas described the resolution as “an insufficient measure that does not respond to the catastrophic situation created by the Zionist (Israeli) war machine”.
On 15 December, Israel approved the delivery of aid via its Kerem Shalom crossing with Gaza. The military yesterday organised a media tour of the facility, where a kilometres-long queue of aid trucks awaited inspection.
Today, a drone strike damaged a merchant ship in waters off Veraval, India, maritime agencies said.
There was no immediate claim of responsiblity but the attack adds to fears of regional escalation from the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Missiles from Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels have disrupted Red Sea shipping.
“We know that Iran was deeply involved in planning the operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea,” US National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said.
There have also been regular exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border, between Israeli forces and Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah movement which, like Hamas, is backed by Iran.
Israel yesterday said rocket fire from Lebanon had killed one of its soldiers near the frontier. Hezbollah said Israeli fire killed two of its fighters.

UN Security Council passes resolution for acceleration of aid into Gaza after days of negotiations,"LAST UPDATE|22 Dec 2023

FIGHTING CONTINUED BETWEEN Israel and Hamas in Gaza today as the UN Security Council approved a much-delayed resolution to boost aid to the besieged Palestinian territory where civilians are struggling to find food.
The Gaza health ministry said more than 410 people had been killed in Israeli bombardment over 48 hours, including 16 in a strike on the Gaza City district of Jabalia today.
Four members of one family, including a girl, died in another strike on a civilian vehicle in Rafah in southern Gaza, the ministry said.
An AFP video showed the impact had splayed the vehicle’s roof, leaving the wreckage blackened and blood-stained.
“The Jeep was hit. Five minutes later people gathered and a second attack took place,” witness Hamada Abu Taha said.
Today, following diplomatic wrangling, the Security Council finally adopted a resolution that “demands” all sides in the conflict allow the “safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale”.
The UN resolution urged the creation of “conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities” but did not call for an immediate end to fighting.
Israel ally the United States, which earlier this month blocked a vote calling for a ceasefire, abstained along with Russia, and the watered-down text passed with 13 votes in favour.

It came after the UN’s World Food Programme warned that Gaza’s population is at a “high risk of famine”.
The current conflict has raged since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen crossed Gaza’s militarised border and killed around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Hamas militants also abducted about 250 people, 129 of whom remain in Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched a relentless bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, where 20,057 people have been killed, according to the latest Palestinian toll.
Most of the dead are women and children, Palestinian officials say.
The Palestinian envoy to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, called the council’s resolution “a step in the right direction”, but said it “must be accompanied by massive pressure for an immediate ceasefire”.

But in a statement, Hamas described it as “an insufficient measure that does not respond to the catastrophic situation created by the Zionist (Israeli) war machine”.
UN chief Antonio Guterres said after the vote that “the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza”.
In a statement, ActionAid Ireland CEO Karol Balfe said that while it was a relief to see the US abstain rather than veto the resolution, it was “disappointing to see a watered-down concession that neither offers an end to hostilities nor an urgent scale-up of aid”.
“People in Gaza need the bombs to stop and for the war to end now but instead the resolution kicks attempts to reach a ceasefire into the long grass,” Balfe said.
She said there is little sense in providing aid to people one day, only to start bombing them again the next.
“We urge the UN Security Council to take seriously its mandate to maintain peace and promote human rights, by demanding a permanent ceasefire – the only way to prevent further senseless loss of life and enable enough life-saving humanitarian aid to reach those who need it.”
The fighting has displaced 1.9 million Gazans according to UN figures, out of a population of 2.4 million, and put out of action most of the 36 hospitals in the territory. Nine remain partly functioning, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.

The UN agency’s head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on social media that “hunger is present, and famine is looming in Gaza.”
“Four out of five households in northern Gaza, and half of the displaced households in the south, are going entire days and nights without eating. This is heartbreaking.”
With swathes of Gaza reduced to rubble, the displaced have been forced into crowded shelters or tents, and are struggling to find food, fuel, water and medical supplies.
According to the UN, the number of aid trucks entering Gaza is well below the daily pre-war average.
Last week Israel approved aid delivery via Kerem Shalom crossing, and the army says on average 80 trucks enter Gaza through it daily.
Journalists in a media tour of the facility today, organised by the Israeli military, could see a miles-long queue of aid trucks held up for hours as they awaited inspection by soldiers.
Egyptian driver Said Abdel Hamid seemed unfazed by the wait, saying he was “proud to bring help to my Palestinian brothers” as he removed the tarpaulin sheet covering his flour cargo for examination.
In north Gaza, parts of Gaza City including Shujaiya have seen street-by-street combat – even building-by-building – between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters.

According to the military, the deaths of two more soldiers in Gaza brought to 139 the number killed since it began its ground assault on 27 October.
Israel said another of its troops was killed today by rocket fire from Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah and other groups have carried out near-daily cross-border assaults in support of Hamas.
Hezbollah said two of its fighters were killed today.
Beyond regular exchanges of fire across the Lebanon border, the war has also sparked fears of wider conflict with missiles from Iran-backed Yemeni rebels – claiming to act in solidarity with Gazans – disrupting Red Sea shipping.
The United States accused Tehran of being involved in the attacks. “We know that Iran was deeply involved in planning the operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea,” National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said.
The area around the city of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza has been a focus of Israeli military operations which “intensified” over the past week, a military spokesperson said.
An evacuation order issued today by the army told residents to evacuate the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza and move further south to Deir al-Balah city.
Many Gazans have fled as far south as they can but say they cannot find safety.
Donkey carts creaked with their belongings as Palestinians leaving the Bureij refugee camp passed through the streets.
“This is not a life: no water, no food, nothing,” said Walaa al-Medini, who had been injured in a strike on her home in Gaza City and uses a wheelchair.
“My daughter died in my lap, and I was rescued from under the rubble after three hours,” she said. “Our house, along with everything around us, was destroyed.”
UN special rapporteur Paula Gaviria Betancur said that “Israel’s military operation in Gaza aims to deport the majority of the civilian population en masse” – claims Israel has denied before.
A one-week truce that ended on 1 December saw 105 hostages released from Gaza captivity, including 80 Israelis in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
A US-Israeli man believed to have been taken captive by Hamas militants on 7 October was killed on the day of the attack, his kibbutz community said today.

"'They're not living, they're surviving': Disease, thirst and hunger threaten displaced Gazans","GUILLEMETTE THOMAS IS the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) medical coordinator for Palestine, with responsibility for the occupied territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Speaking toThe Journalby phone from her base in Jerusalem, Thomas said she has never seen anything like the current conflict.
“It’s the first time I’m exposed to such a horrific situation, with such intense violence, and for such a long period of time,” she says.
MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières) is an NGO that provides humanitarian medical care to people in conflict zones and countries with endemic diseases.
Thomas toldThe Journalabout the dire conditions for displaced people in the Gaza Strip, as well as the Israeli forces’ repeated attacks on hospitals, ambulances and healthcare workers since the beginning of the conflict sparked by Hamas’ attacks on 7 October, which left over 1,000 people dead.
The ensuing bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) has killed at least 20,000 people and displaced around 2 million, the vast majority of the population.
A total siege of Gaza was implemented following the Hamas attacks, with Israel shutting off all food, water, fuel and electricity from the already blockaded and impoverished territory. Precious little humanitarian aid has entered Gaza since then.
The number of dead reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health, however, is likely an underestimate because there are so many people under the rubble of destroyed buildings.
The United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said as much in a recent statement, in which he cited the example of the earthquake that struck Turkey in February, where the death toll doubled after excavating the rubble.
Thomas agrees that the death toll from Israel’s assault on Gaza is likely higher than what has been officially reported.
“We can assume that many, many, many people are still under the rubble, dead, most of them, so definitely the numbers that we have are probably underestimated,” she says.
Another factor that may contribute to an underestimated death toll is the presence of pre-existing health conditions among the Gazan population, which have gone largely untreated since the siege began, Thomas explains.
“We can assume that a lot of them can die from these complications. This is something that we cannot see in the numbers.”

MSF’s  latest report on the situation in Gaza said displaced people are sleeping in rough conditions, with “dangerously little levels of food and water”.
It also said people have been drinking salty water and that “some shelters have one toilet for every 600 people”.
Thomas describes the conditions as “dire” and says that this is leading to a significant rise in diseases, infections and dehydration.
“We are already seeing many, many diseases related to the living conditions and related to the absence of hygiene and access to basic accommodation like showers and toilets,” she says.
“The kind of diseases that we are seeing are, first, diarrhoea because they have no access to clean water. So diarrhoea and dehydration are really, really increasing significantly.”

Another danger is the number of infected wounds among survivors, which she says are also rising.
“A high number of people with wounds have infections… because they have no way to have proper hygiene conditions, no access to healthcare, and so even the most basic ones are getting infected.

“Another thing that we can consider related to the living conditions are the respiratory tract infections, which are really increasing because they are living outside and the places where they are living are overcrowded and that’s also a factor that leads to this kind of infection, also skin infections.”
Such conditions are typical of conflicts that displace so many people, she explains. However, the major difference for the people of Gaza is that they are unable to flee the violence because Gaza is completely fenced off.
“They’re not living, they’re surviving. And they are living in exactly the same conditions that unfortunately many, many displaced people are facing around the world.
“The thing that is really increasing the atrocity of what’s happening is that they have no way to flee the bombing, the shelling, the violence, and that’s very specific to this conflict. People are in a vulnerable, very difficult situation due to the living conditions, but also due to the constant violence and threats to their lives,” Thomas explains.

Since the onset of the Israeli bombardment and subsequent ground invasion of Gaza, MSF staff have witnessed attacks on hospitals, ambulances, patients and healthcare workers.
“What I can tell you is that since the beginning of the conflict, what we can see is that the IDF are targeting directly the health facilities, either hospitals or ambulances or other health facilities, which is totally unacceptable and which is against all humanitarian law,” Thomas says.
“They are doing that on a regular basis. Even now they are doing that in the north of Gaza, surrounding hospitals, targeting the people inside, shooting the people inside.”
Thomas says this is something they have seen almost daily since fighting began.
She says that in the north of Gaza, no healthcare facilities are currently able to receive any patients “because they are surrounded by tanks, because they have no fuel, no supply, no nothing, no staff able to provide any care due to the total siege that the army are doing around the hospitals”.
This cannot be alleviated because of the restriction of any access to the north of Gaza, she explains.
In one incident, Thomas says that Israeli forces “directly targeted” the maternity ward of the Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis, where MSF staff are working.
“One patient, one little girl, died following this incident. So what we can see since the beginning of the conflict is that for the Israeli army, the hospitals are targets and they are not respecting at all humanitarian laws.”
On Tuesday, the IDF told CNN that “upon receiving the reports about damage to Al-Nasser hospital, an initial review was carried out. At this stage, it is not possible to determine with certainty what was the source of the damage to the hospital”.
Israel’s stated reasons for targeting hospitals, as well as refugee camps, schools and residential buildings in Gaza, is that they believe Hamas militants are operating from within them.
Asked if MSF staff have ever seen Hamas fighters operating from hospitals in Gaza, Thomas replies, “No, never”.
The most high-profile incident in which the IDF assaulted and raided a hospital in the last few months was the case of Al Shifa hospital, the largest in Gaza, which the IDF said was hiding Hamas’ command centre in tunnels below the facility.
No evidence of such a command centre has been produced by the IDF since that assault in mid-November.
The IDF did release footage of what it said were tunnels under the hospital grounds, but aWashington Post investigationhas found that evidence provided by the IDF does not support itsclaims of an extensive military complex.
In fact, a tunnel systemwas built by Israelat the hospital while it occupied Gaza during the 1980s.
“We’ve been working in Shifa for many years and we have never seen any fighters inside Shifa hospital. MSF has never witnessed this kind of thing,” Thomas says.
“What we can see in the hospitals are patients, are health workers, that’s what we see in the hospitals.”

Irish banks urged to respond to claims that payments to Gaza have been 'blocked',"SINN FÉIN HAS written to a number of Irish banks asking them to outline whether donations and payments to people in Gaza are being “blocked or frustrated” by the financial institutions.
It comes afterThe Journalheard a number of accounts from different individuals outlining difficulties when trying to transfer money to the Palestinian territory, with Irish and international banks facing criticism for how they process the transactions.
Sinn Féin finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty toldThe Journalthat any attempts to hinder the transfer of funds should be taken extremely seriously.
Banks can refuse to allow a transfer of funds to go through if there’s a concern it could be used for terrorism and, given that the chief political entity in Gaza, Hamas, is designated by the EU and other blocs as a terrorist organisation, some campaigners believe this means a host of other transactions wind up getting caught in the net.
Since Israel’s invasion and bombardment of Gaza began following the surprise attack by Hamas on 7 October, various fundraisers have been held around the country to help support Palestinians.
Some of this money has likely been directed to official aid organisations, but with a blockade at the Rafah crossing on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, aid agencies have regularly expressed frustration at how little of these supports have made its way through.
This has led to some deciding to seek alternative ways to provide support to the region.
But this has seen efforts impeded by banks declining to transfer funds, with one financial institution allegedly claiming that an Irish man seeking to transfer funds to friends in Gaza was at risk of being duped – even though he knew the people he was trying to send the money to.
It’s understood some private firms have also struggled to transfer money, including media outlets.
Eddy Blake and a number of friends were able to raise €1,200 through a music gig held in Waterford city last month.
He was hoping to send the money to friends in Gaza he had made through contacts on a city twinning committee. The committee has successfully campaigned in recent years for Waterford to be linked officially with Ramallah, a city in the West Bank.
He toldThe Journalhe was motivated from news and social media reports showing the “flattening” of Gaza by aerial bombardment.
However, he found efforts to transfer the funds frustrated by several banks.
“I think the money would be best suited going directly to them. It would also probably reach them faster given what you see on the news of these loads of trucks on the border of Gaza, not being allowed entry,” he toldThe Journal.
One of Blake’s friends is a man in southern Gaza who as a result of the Israeli army’s bombing campaign has seen his home become a shelter to families.
Michelle Byrne, who is a member of the Waterford-Ramallah twinning committee, outlined toThe Journalthat their Gaza contacts are friends made from visits to Palestine in the years prior to the current war.
“[They're] looking after 40 displaced people in his house so we were hoping to send funds to sustain them as they fall outside of traditional refugee camp/aid structures. I know the people through my visit to Palestine 6 years ago,” she said.
Byrne added that she found it frustrating to hear of financial institutions “trying to imply the donations are a scam”, when there are long-established relations between Irish communities and Gaza.
Blake tried AIB – which he pointed to being almost half-owned by the State – but found that while the transaction at first was a success, the money was refunded to his own account quickly that same day.

Blake also tried both Revolut and Western Union, which are known for international transfers, but to no avail.
Blake added that at no stage was any reference made to Hamas’ status as a proscribed terrorist organisation. “I’m pretty sure that by the way they were talking to me, it felt like they were really trying not to use that sort of terminology,” he said.
When he spoke to Western Union, he claimed that the bank warned him that he was the “victim of a con and being duped into sending money to somebody that doesn’t exist”, which he said was ridiculous.
“I ended up feeling disheartened after trying three different banks,” he added.
In recent days, he has managed to transfer funds through a friendly contact in a separate country.
“[My friend] has been experiencing a huge amount of blackouts in terms of broadband reception as well as mobile coverage but we’ve been able to make contact with him again in the last few days thankfully,” Blake said.
He said the experience made him question whether there is an “unofficial stance” to prevent money being sent to the region, or if concerns around helping groups recognised as terrorist organisations has spread so widely that it means banks are effectively not letting money through.
“Once I called AIB, they didn’t really elaborate as to why they refunded me the money. I just said to them, look, can you do it again for me so they got in touch with their international department of AIB but just came back and said they said they wouldn’t be able to clear any money onto Palestine,” he said.
WhenThe Journalcontacted AIB regarding its policies for financial transfers from Ireland accounts to accounts based in Gaza, it contended that it is “processing payments to Gaza/Palestine as usual”.
“AIB has not instructed payment blocks against Gaza or Ramallah and we comply with all legal and regulatory obligations.” a spokesperson said.
However, the bank said that once payments sent via AIB are “routed through intermediary banks”, the Irish bank “cannot comment on any reviews or restrictions that other banks may have”.
When asked whether it can confirm if any payments have been made to accounts in Gaza since October, the bank did not respond directly. It said: “AIB can send payments to Gaza.”
The Journalalso contacted Bank of Ireland but did not respond when asked if it’s allowing money to go to Gaza. Western Union also did not respond when contacted.
Doherty, a Donegal TD for Sinn Féin, said that any allegations that payments are being frustrated was of serious concern.
“Any reports that attempts to transfer money or aid to journalists, civilians or aid charities are being blocked or frustrated is a cause for serious concern,” he said.
“Accordingly, I have written to Irish banks to clarify their policy towards such transactions.”
Unofficial
Philomena McKenna, a member of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, alleged that the group believes there to be a “longstanding” unofficial policy that financial transfers to Palestine are thwarted.
“The Americans do have a block in place preventing banks transfers to Gaza, same as for Cuba, and it does look like a lot of other banks follow the Americans’ lead on this. I do think people should always really try and challenge the banks on this though,” she said.
While there may be some uncertainty over whether donations will reach those who need it, McKenna said that aid organisations should still be used and have a credible track record for getting supports into Gaza.
“Some banks were destroyed in the very first week [of the Israeli attack] so it’s almost impossible to get money there. It’s a shocking state of affairs, and things will open up eventually and we will be able to get aid to people, but at the moment it is dire.”

UN Security Council passes resolution for acceleration of aid into Gaza after days of negotiations,"LAST UPDATE|22 Dec 2023

FIGHTING CONTINUED BETWEEN Israel and Hamas in Gaza today as the UN Security Council approved a much-delayed resolution to boost aid to the besieged Palestinian territory where civilians are struggling to find food.
The Gaza health ministry said more than 410 people had been killed in Israeli bombardment over 48 hours, including 16 in a strike on the Gaza City district of Jabalia today.
Four members of one family, including a girl, died in another strike on a civilian vehicle in Rafah in southern Gaza, the ministry said.

It came after the UN’s World Food Programme warned that Gaza’s population is at a “high risk of famine”.
The current conflict has raged since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen crossed Gaza’s militarised border and killed around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Hamas militants also abducted about 250 people, 129 of whom remain in Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched a relentless bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, where 20,057 people have been killed, according to the latest Palestinian toll.
Most of the dead are women and children, Palestinian officials say.
The Palestinian envoy to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, called the council’s resolution “a step in the right direction”, but said it “must be accompanied by massive pressure for an immediate ceasefire”.

But in a statement, Hamas described it as “an insufficient measure that does not respond to the catastrophic situation created by the Zionist (Israeli) war machine”.
UN chief Antonio Guterres said after the vote that “the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza”.
In a statement, ActionAid Ireland CEO Karol Balfe said that while it was a relief to see the US abstain rather than veto the resolution, it was “disappointing to see a watered-down concession that neither offers an end to hostilities nor an urgent scale-up of aid”.
“People in Gaza need the bombs to stop and for the war to end now but instead the resolution kicks attempts to reach a ceasefire into the long grass,” Balfe said.
She said there is little sense in providing aid to people one day, only to start bombing them again the next.
“We urge the UN Security Council to take seriously its mandate to maintain peace and promote human rights, by demanding a permanent ceasefire – the only way to prevent further senseless loss of life and enable enough life-saving humanitarian aid to reach those who need it.”
The fighting has displaced 1.9 million Gazans according to UN figures, out of a population of 2.4 million, and put out of action most of the 36 hospitals in the territory. Nine remain partly functioning, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.

The UN agency’s head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on social media that “hunger is present, and famine is looming in Gaza.”
“Four out of five households in northern Gaza, and half of the displaced households in the south, are going entire days and nights without eating. This is heartbreaking.”
With swathes of Gaza reduced to rubble, the displaced have been forced into crowded shelters or tents, and are struggling to find food, fuel, water and medical supplies.
According to the UN, the number of aid trucks entering Gaza is well below the daily pre-war average.
Last week Israel approved aid delivery via Kerem Shalom crossing, and the army says on average 80 trucks enter Gaza through it daily.
Journalists in a media tour of the facility today, organised by the Israeli military, could see a miles-long queue of aid trucks held up for hours as they awaited inspection by soldiers.
Egyptian driver Said Abdel Hamid seemed unfazed by the wait, saying he was “proud to bring help to my Palestinian brothers” as he removed the tarpaulin sheet covering his flour cargo for examination.
In north Gaza, parts of Gaza City including Shujaiya have seen street-by-street combat – even building-by-building – between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters.

According to the military, the deaths of two more soldiers in Gaza brought to 139 the number killed since it began its ground assault on 27 October.
Israel said another of its troops was killed today by rocket fire from Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah and other groups have carried out near-daily cross-border assaults in support of Hamas.
Hezbollah said two of its fighters were killed today.
Beyond regular exchanges of fire across the Lebanon border, the war has also sparked fears of wider conflict with missiles from Iran-backed Yemeni rebels – claiming to act in solidarity with Gazans – disrupting Red Sea shipping.
The United States accused Tehran of being involved in the attacks. “We know that Iran was deeply involved in planning the operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea,” National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said.
The area around the city of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza has been a focus of Israeli military operations which “intensified” over the past week, a military spokesperson said.
An evacuation order issued today by the army told residents to evacuate the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza and move further south to Deir al-Balah city.
Many Gazans have fled as far south as they can but say they cannot find safety.
Donkey carts creaked with their belongings as Palestinians leaving the Bureij refugee camp passed through the streets.
“This is not a life: no water, no food, nothing,” said Walaa al-Medini, who had been injured in a strike on her home in Gaza City and uses a wheelchair.
“My daughter died in my lap, and I was rescued from under the rubble after three hours,” she said. “Our house, along with everything around us, was destroyed.”
UN special rapporteur Paula Gaviria Betancur said that “Israel’s military operation in Gaza aims to deport the majority of the civilian population en masse” – claims Israel has denied before.
A one-week truce that ended on 1 December saw 105 hostages released from Gaza captivity, including 80 Israelis in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
A US-Israeli man believed to have been taken captive by Hamas militants on 7 October was killed on the day of the attack, his kibbutz community said today.

"'They're not living, they're surviving': Disease, thirst and hunger threaten displaced Gazans","GUILLEMETTE THOMAS IS the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) medical coordinator for Palestine, with responsibility for the occupied territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Speaking toThe Journalby phone from her base in Jerusalem, Thomas said she has never seen anything like the current conflict.
“It’s the first time I’m exposed to such a horrific situation, with such intense violence, and for such a long period of time,” she says.
MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières) is an NGO that provides humanitarian medical care to people in conflict zones and countries with endemic diseases.
Thomas toldThe Journalabout the dire conditions for displaced people in the Gaza Strip, as well as the Israeli forces’ repeated attacks on hospitals, ambulances and healthcare workers since the beginning of the conflict sparked by Hamas’ attacks on 7 October, which left over 1,000 people dead.
The ensuing bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) has killed at least 20,000 people and displaced around 2 million, the vast majority of the population.
A total siege of Gaza was implemented following the Hamas attacks, with Israel shutting off all food, water, fuel and electricity from the already blockaded and impoverished territory. Precious little humanitarian aid has entered Gaza since then.
The number of dead reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health, however, is likely an underestimate because there are so many people under the rubble of destroyed buildings.
The United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said as much in a recent statement, in which he cited the example of the earthquake that struck Turkey in February, where the death toll doubled after excavating the rubble.
Thomas agrees that the death toll from Israel’s assault on Gaza is likely higher than what has been officially reported.
“We can assume that many, many, many people are still under the rubble, dead, most of them, so definitely the numbers that we have are probably underestimated,” she says.
Another factor that may contribute to an underestimated death toll is the presence of pre-existing health conditions among the Gazan population, which have gone largely untreated since the siege began, Thomas explains.
“We can assume that a lot of them can die from these complications. This is something that we cannot see in the numbers.”

MSF’s  latest report on the situation in Gaza said displaced people are sleeping in rough conditions, with “dangerously little levels of food and water”.
It also said people have been drinking salty water and that “some shelters have one toilet for every 600 people”.
Thomas describes the conditions as “dire” and says that this is leading to a significant rise in diseases, infections and dehydration.
“We are already seeing many, many diseases related to the living conditions and related to the absence of hygiene and access to basic accommodation like showers and toilets,” she says.
“The kind of diseases that we are seeing are, first, diarrhoea because they have no access to clean water. So diarrhoea and dehydration are really, really increasing significantly.”

Another danger is the number of infected wounds among survivors, which she says are also rising.
“A high number of people with wounds have infections… because they have no way to have proper hygiene conditions, no access to healthcare, and so even the most basic ones are getting infected.

“Another thing that we can consider related to the living conditions are the respiratory tract infections, which are really increasing because they are living outside and the places where they are living are overcrowded and that’s also a factor that leads to this kind of infection, also skin infections.”
Such conditions are typical of conflicts that displace so many people, she explains. However, the major difference for the people of Gaza is that they are unable to flee the violence because Gaza is completely fenced off.
“They’re not living, they’re surviving. And they are living in exactly the same conditions that unfortunately many, many displaced people are facing around the world.
“The thing that is really increasing the atrocity of what’s happening is that they have no way to flee the bombing, the shelling, the violence, and that’s very specific to this conflict. People are in a vulnerable, very difficult situation due to the living conditions, but also due to the constant violence and threats to their lives,” Thomas explains.

Since the onset of the Israeli bombardment and subsequent ground invasion of Gaza, MSF staff have witnessed attacks on hospitals, ambulances, patients and healthcare workers.
“What I can tell you is that since the beginning of the conflict, what we can see is that the IDF are targeting directly the health facilities, either hospitals or ambulances or other health facilities, which is totally unacceptable and which is against all humanitarian law,” Thomas says.
“They are doing that on a regular basis. Even now they are doing that in the north of Gaza, surrounding hospitals, targeting the people inside, shooting the people inside.”
Thomas says this is something they have seen almost daily since fighting began.
She says that in the north of Gaza, no healthcare facilities are currently able to receive any patients “because they are surrounded by tanks, because they have no fuel, no supply, no nothing, no staff able to provide any care due to the total siege that the army are doing around the hospitals”.
This cannot be alleviated because of the restriction of any access to the north of Gaza, she explains.
In one incident, Thomas says that Israeli forces “directly targeted” the maternity ward of the Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis, where MSF staff are working.
“One patient, one little girl, died following this incident. So what we can see since the beginning of the conflict is that for the Israeli army, the hospitals are targets and they are not respecting at all humanitarian laws.”
On Tuesday, the IDF told CNN that “upon receiving the reports about damage to Al-Nasser hospital, an initial review was carried out. At this stage, it is not possible to determine with certainty what was the source of the damage to the hospital”.
Israel’s stated reasons for targeting hospitals, as well as refugee camps, schools and residential buildings in Gaza, is that they believe Hamas militants are operating from within them.
Asked if MSF staff have ever seen Hamas fighters operating from hospitals in Gaza, Thomas replies, “No, never”.
The most high-profile incident in which the IDF assaulted and raided a hospital in the last few months was the case of Al Shifa hospital, the largest in Gaza, which the IDF said was hiding Hamas’ command centre in tunnels below the facility.
No evidence of such a command centre has been produced by the IDF since that assault in mid-November.
The IDF did release footage of what it said were tunnels under the hospital grounds, but aWashington Post investigationhas found that evidence provided by the IDF does not support itsclaims of an extensive military complex.
In fact, a tunnel systemwas built by Israelat the hospital while it occupied Gaza during the 1980s.
“We’ve been working in Shifa for many years and we have never seen any fighters inside Shifa hospital. MSF has never witnessed this kind of thing,” Thomas says.
“What we can see in the hospitals are patients, are health workers, that’s what we see in the hospitals.”

Irish banks urged to respond to claims that payments to Gaza have been 'blocked',"SINN FÉIN HAS written to a number of Irish banks asking them to outline whether donations and payments to people in Gaza are being “blocked or frustrated” by the financial institutions.
It comes afterThe Journalheard a number of accounts from different individuals outlining difficulties when trying to transfer money to the Palestinian territory, with Irish and international banks facing criticism for how they process the transactions.
Sinn Féin finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty toldThe Journalthat any attempts to hinder the transfer of funds should be taken extremely seriously.
Banks can refuse to allow a transfer of funds to go through if there’s a concern it could be used for terrorism and, given that the chief political entity in Gaza, Hamas, is designated by the EU and other blocs as a terrorist organisation, some campaigners believe this means a host of other transactions wind up getting caught in the net.
Since Israel’s invasion and bombardment of Gaza began following the surprise attack by Hamas on 7 October, various fundraisers have been held around the country to help support Palestinians.
Some of this money has likely been directed to official aid organisations, but with a blockade at the Rafah crossing on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, aid agencies have regularly expressed frustration at how little of these supports have made its way through.
This has led to some deciding to seek alternative ways to provide support to the region.
But this has seen efforts impeded by banks declining to transfer funds, with one financial institution allegedly claiming that an Irish man seeking to transfer funds to friends in Gaza was at risk of being duped – even though he knew the people he was trying to send the money to.
It’s understood some private firms have also struggled to transfer money, including media outlets.
Eddy Blake and a number of friends were able to raise €1,200 through a music gig held in Waterford city last month.
He was hoping to send the money to friends in Gaza he had made through contacts on a city twinning committee. The committee has successfully campaigned in recent years for Waterford to be linked officially with Ramallah, a city in the West Bank.
He toldThe Journalhe was motivated from news and social media reports showing the “flattening” of Gaza by aerial bombardment.
However, he found efforts to transfer the funds frustrated by several banks.
“I think the money would be best suited going directly to them. It would also probably reach them faster given what you see on the news of these loads of trucks on the border of Gaza, not being allowed entry,” he toldThe Journal.
One of Blake’s friends is a man in southern Gaza who as a result of the Israeli army’s bombing campaign has seen his home become a shelter to families.
Michelle Byrne, who is a member of the Waterford-Ramallah twinning committee, outlined toThe Journalthat their Gaza contacts are friends made from visits to Palestine in the years prior to the current war.
“[They're] looking after 40 displaced people in his house so we were hoping to send funds to sustain them as they fall outside of traditional refugee camp/aid structures. I know the people through my visit to Palestine 6 years ago,” she said.
Byrne added that she found it frustrating to hear of financial institutions “trying to imply the donations are a scam”, when there are long-established relations between Irish communities and Gaza.
Blake tried AIB – which he pointed to being almost half-owned by the State – but found that while the transaction at first was a success, the money was refunded to his own account quickly that same day.

Blake also tried both Revolut and Western Union, which are known for international transfers, but to no avail.
Blake added that at no stage was any reference made to Hamas’ status as a proscribed terrorist organisation. “I’m pretty sure that by the way they were talking to me, it felt like they were really trying not to use that sort of terminology,” he said.
When he spoke to Western Union, he claimed that the bank warned him that he was the “victim of a con and being duped into sending money to somebody that doesn’t exist”, which he said was ridiculous.
“I ended up feeling disheartened after trying three different banks,” he added.
In recent days, he has managed to transfer funds through a friendly contact in a separate country.
“[My friend] has been experiencing a huge amount of blackouts in terms of broadband reception as well as mobile coverage but we’ve been able to make contact with him again in the last few days thankfully,” Blake said.
He said the experience made him question whether there is an “unofficial stance” to prevent money being sent to the region, or if concerns around helping groups recognised as terrorist organisations has spread so widely that it means banks are effectively not letting money through.
“Once I called AIB, they didn’t really elaborate as to why they refunded me the money. I just said to them, look, can you do it again for me so they got in touch with their international department of AIB but just came back and said they said they wouldn’t be able to clear any money onto Palestine,” he said.
WhenThe Journalcontacted AIB regarding its policies for financial transfers from Ireland accounts to accounts based in Gaza, it contended that it is “processing payments to Gaza/Palestine as usual”.
“AIB has not instructed payment blocks against Gaza or Ramallah and we comply with all legal and regulatory obligations.” a spokesperson said.
However, the bank said that once payments sent via AIB are “routed through intermediary banks”, the Irish bank “cannot comment on any reviews or restrictions that other banks may have”.
When asked whether it can confirm if any payments have been made to accounts in Gaza since October, the bank did not respond directly. It said: “AIB can send payments to Gaza.”
The Journalalso contacted Bank of Ireland but did not respond when asked if it’s allowing money to go to Gaza. Western Union also did not respond when contacted.
Doherty, a Donegal TD for Sinn Féin, said that any allegations that payments are being frustrated was of serious concern.
“Any reports that attempts to transfer money or aid to journalists, civilians or aid charities are being blocked or frustrated is a cause for serious concern,” he said.
“Accordingly, I have written to Irish banks to clarify their policy towards such transactions.”
Unofficial
Philomena McKenna, a member of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, alleged that the group believes there to be a “longstanding” unofficial policy that financial transfers to Palestine are thwarted.
“The Americans do have a block in place preventing banks transfers to Gaza, same as for Cuba, and it does look like a lot of other banks follow the Americans’ lead on this. I do think people should always really try and challenge the banks on this though,” she said.
While there may be some uncertainty over whether donations will reach those who need it, McKenna said that aid organisations should still be used and have a credible track record for getting supports into Gaza.
“Some banks were destroyed in the very first week [of the Israeli attack] so it’s almost impossible to get money there. It’s a shocking state of affairs, and things will open up eventually and we will be able to get aid to people, but at the moment it is dire.”

Dublin family plead for Government's help in getting daughter out of Gaza as bombings continue,"A DUBLIN-BASED Palestinian family has re-issued a plea for the Irish Government to help them get their 26-year-old daughter out of Gaza, as airstrikes by the Israeli military fal near the house she is sheltering in.
Business graduate Saja Samour is currently based in Dair al-Balah in the central area of the Gaza strip.
In the last month, more buildings in her immediate area have been reduced to rubble by Israeli military strikes. Her family in Dublin are afraid for her well-being.
She is sheltering in a house with 23 people in it. They are reported to be rationing their remaining food and eating canned produce for breakfast. Her family says that they often do not have anything to eat at all.
Her father Akram and her mother Hanan try to contact Saja everyday but it is sometimes difficult, as she is using a small generator to charge her phone. In recent weeks, she has sent them photos of nearby buildings destroyed in bombings, that are visible from the balcony of the house she is staying in.
The Samour family have sent a visa application for Saja to be able to come to Ireland to the Irish embassy in Tel Aviv. Their solicitor has emphasised that Saja is in an increasingly dangerous situation, and her family are growing desperate to get her out of Gaza.
They are planning to go to the High Court to make an urgent appeal for Saja’s case.
A group of Palestinian familiespermanently based in Ireland are similarly appealing to the Government to help their loved ones leave Gaza.
So far, the Irish Government has secured the safe passage of over 50 Irish citizens and dependents out of Gaza and into Egypt.
It has said that Israeli authorities have emphasised that those with Irish citizenship are to be prioritised, although not every Irish citizen in Gaza has been allowed to leave via the Rafah crossing.
Tánaiste Micheál Martin yesterday said that Ireland is working to get Irish citizens and their dependents out of Gaza, but he stressed that the Israeli authorities have made it clear that those with citizenship will be prioritised.
While the Department of Justice has said it would expedite applications for long-stay visas from Palestinians who want to join their families here, Akram has claimed there has been a lack of engagement from the Government so far.
“We don’t get to write the list,” he said.
The situation has left Palestinian families, like the Samours who have children and relatives stuck in Gaza, fearful that they are not being considered for safe passage to Egypt, and then Ireland.
Saja had to flee her home in northern Gaza in the aftermath of Israel declared war in response to attacks by Hamas on 7 October. She has since relocated multiple times.
As the death toll climbs higher every day, she has informed her family that the conditions she is living in have worsened in the last month.

Saja sent the following account of the situation over the last month.
“On a Sunday [at the start of December] at 1 am we woke up at the sound of the bombs and the dust coming through the windows. I was terrified at that time. It was very close.  The next day I took those photos from the window of the one of the rooms in the house I am currently staying in.
Collapsed buildings are visible from the house Saja is sheltering in.
“Regarding food, we often eat canned food. We eat cans of beans every day for breakfast. The basics are not available, such as flour, eggs, and chicken.., and when they are available, they are available at very high prices, almost 5 times the original prices. Now we only have less than half a bag of flour that was originally 25 kilograms in size, and the house contains 23 people.
“Even personal hygiene matters such as shampoo and tissues have become almost non-existent. Not to mention chocolate, chips, sweets, soft drinks, or snack foods in general, these do not exist at all.
“With all this, when I think about returning to the north if a complete ceasefire is agreed upon, I feel extremely afraid of the conditions that we will face at that time, including the interruption of electricity and water supplies, cell phone signal, and sewage,” she said.
Saja Samour.
Her father Akram said he and his wife Hanan, and their children Ibrahim (9), Razan (11), Abdelrahman (15), and Mohammed (20), came to Ireland a few years ago in the hope of finding “freedom and hope for the future”.
Mohammed is an Irish citizen, as he was born in Belfast when the family lived there for a number of years during the violence of the second intifada in Gaza during the 2000s.
Akram said that he appreciates that Ireland has a more “advanced” position on the need for a ceasefire in Gaza, but added that his family is in need of “real support” to get Saja to safety.
“The answer of the Department of Justice about bringing Saja to Ireland was strange for me,” he said.
“We are talking about a very tough, difficult, horrific situation. She is under siege. Her visa application is being treated as a normal case, and it is taking a long time to get a decision, which we need urgently.
“My son is an Irish-born citizen, and having lived here for a number of years and getting stamp 4 permanent residency, our whole family will be citizens here soon. We want to contribute here. Both of my sons are working, my daughter is in school, and I am doing job interviews.”
Akram’s sister passed away in Gaza last month. She had a number of disabilities and health conditions, and couldn’t get any access to healthcare due to the ongoing targeting of health facilities, and the extreme demand on services.
He lost contact a month ago with his brother and his brother’s family. He does not know what has happened to them.
“Every day, we wake up thinking we will hear bad news about Saja, we are asking the Irish Government please to help us while there is time,” Akram said.

Israeli army bombs scores of targets in Gaza as diplomats press on with efforts to halt fighting,"LAST UPDATE|21 Dec 2023

THE ISRAELI ARMY has said bombed scores of targets in the Gaza Strip as diplomats pressed on with efforts to halt the fighting that Hamas says has killed 20,000 people in the Palestinian territory.
United Nations relief chief Martin Griffiths called the surging death toll a “tragic and shameful milestone” as the UN Security Council was to again discuss a draft resolution calling for a pause in the bloodiest ever Gaza conflict.
The army said its aircraft had struck another 230 targets in besieged Gaza over the past day, including a rocket launch site, while ground forces had found weapons inside a school in Jabalia near Gaza City.
Incoming rocket fire set off air raid sirens in southern Israel and Tel Aviv, where police reported falling shrapnel but no casualties so far after the projectiles were intercepted by air defences.
Hamas’s military wing announced it had launched the Tel Aviv-bound “missile barrage in response to the Israeli massacres against civilians”.
The conflict began when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
The Hamas government’s media office said yesterday at least 20,000 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory, with 8,000 children and 6,200 women among the dead.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
In the far-southern city of Rafah, a centre for many internally displaced Palestinians, fireballs and smoke rose after explosions yesterday.
Hopes that Israel and Hamas could be inching towards another truce and hostage release deal have risen this week as the head of the Palestinian militant group visited Egypt and talks were held in Europe.
Mossad director David Barnea held a “positive meeting” in Warsaw with CIA chief Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, a source familiar with the talks told AFP.
Qatar-based Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh visited Egypt yesterday for talks with the country’s intelligence chief Abbas Kamel.

However, the stated positions of Israel and Hamas remain far apart.
A Hamas official told AFP that “a total ceasefire and a retreat of the Israeli occupation army from the Gaza Strip are a precondition for any serious negotiation” on a hostage-prisoner swap.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there could be no ceasefire in Gaza before the “elimination” of Hamas, which Israel, the United States and some other countries consider a “terrorist” organisation.
And US President Joe Biden said of a fresh hostage release deal: “There’s no expectation at this point. But we are pushing it.”

Qatar, backed by Egypt and the United States, last month helped broker a first week-long truce that saw 80 Israeli hostages freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
One former hostage, Ofir Engel, 18, returned to Kibbutz Beeri alongside families of other captives and gathered at the burnt remains of their former homes.
“They abused us mentally,” he recounted of his captivity. “One of the most difficult moments was when terrorists moved us in complete darkness with lots of booms.
“I was there. Every moment hostages are there it’s dangerous. They have no time. Why do I get to be here and they don’t? They have to come back home. Now.”
The UN human rights office in Ramallah said it had received reports that Israeli troops had “summarily killed” at least 11 unarmed Palestinian men in a Gaza neighbourhood this week.
The incident “raises alarm about the possible commission of a war crime”, it said, adding the men were killed in front of their family members in the Al-Rimal area of Gaza City.
An Israeli official rejected the claims as “nothing but blood libel” and “yet another example of the partisan and prejudiced approach against Israel” by the UN body.
Israel said its troops had uncovered a tunnel network used by Hamas leaders including Yahya Sinwar, the Gaza chief of the militant group.
The military released footage yesterday it said showed the “large network” around Gaza City’s Palestine Square linking hideouts and residences.

Israel’s army said three soldiers were killed yesterday, bringing the death toll of its forces to 137 in the Gaza Strip since ground operations began in late October.
An AFPTV live camera yesterday filmed two bombs hitting Rafah, where many of the territory’s estimated 1.9 million displaced have fled.
The Gaza health ministry said Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians when houses and a mosque in Rafah were hit. It said later at least 30 more people were killed in an Israeli strike that hit two houses east of Khan Yunis.
The UN Security Council is due to try once again today to pass a resolution calling for a halt in fighting after previous efforts to win Washington’s backing fell short.
Israel has rejected the term “ceasefire”, and Washington has used its veto twice to thwart resolutions opposed by Israel since the start of the conflict.
The United Arab Emirates is sponsoring a proposed resolution which has already been watered down to secure compromise, according to a draft version seen by AFP.
It calls for “the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities”.
The conflict has sparked fears of regional escalation, with exchanges of fire over the Lebanon border, and missiles from Iran-backed Yemeni rebels disrupting Red Sea shipping.
Israel said today one of its fighter jets and artillery had struck Iran-backed Hezbollah militants overnight in response to incoming fire.

"More than 20,000 dead in Gaza since 7 October, Hamas says","LAST UPDATE|20 Dec 2023

THE DEATH TOLL in Gaza since the beginning of Israel’s war on Hamas on 7 October has surpassed 20,000, according to Hamas’ government.
Some 8,000 children and 6,200 women were among the dead, two months into the most recent conflict.
The shocking figures are released as hopes have risen for another truce and hostage release deal, following secret talks and as the head of the Palestinian militant group visited Egypt.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night told relatives of some of the remaining 129 captives held in Gaza since the 7 October attacks that his spy chief was working on efforts to “free our hostages”.
“I have just sent the head of Mossad to Europe twice to promote a process to free our hostages,” the premier told them. “I will spare no effort on the subject, and our duty is to bring them all back.”
Mossad director David Barnea held a “positive meeting” in Warsaw this week with CIA chief Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, a source familiar with the talks told AFP, asking not to be named.
Talks were ongoing “with the aim of reaching an agreement around the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza in exchange for a truce and the potential release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons,” said the source.
The Qatar-based chief of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, on today travelled to Egypt, traditionally a key mediator between Israel and the Palestinians, for talks with intelligence chief Abbas Kamel.
A source close to Hamas, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the talks would focus on stopping the conflict and “to prepare an agreement for the release of prisoners (and) the end of the siege imposed on the Gaza Strip”.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
President Isaac Herzog has said Israel was “ready for another humanitarian pause and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages”.
Another Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad, meanwhile, released video footage it claimed showed two hostages, ramping up pressure on Israel.

The bloodiest ever Gaza conflict began when Hamas attacked on 7 October, killing around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
Israel launched a military campaign that Gaza’s health ministry says has killed 19,667 people, mostly women and children, while also cutting off most water, food and power supplies.
Qatar last month helped broker a first week-long truce in which 80 Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
The source close to Hamas said the Egypt talks would focus on proposals including a week-long truce that would see the release of 40 Israeli hostages, including women, children and male non-combatants.
Haniyeh, before leaving Qatar, met Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, but no details of their meeting were released.
Fighting raged unabated today in Gaza, where the Israeli army reported close quarter combat and more than 300 strikes over the past day, while the death toll among its own forces rose to 134 inside Gaza.
It said “ground, aerial and naval operations were carried out on dozens of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure” including rocket launch sites and military command and control centres in Khan Yunis.
Hamas sources said at least 11 people were killed overnight in Israeli strikes.
In Khan Yunis, residents searched by hand through the rubble of a building completely flattened by bombardment.
Three corpses lay on the floor of the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, where wounded people were treated, including children.
One man, Abed Abu Aisha, came in carrying his crying child, both covered in blood and dust.
“A missile hit our house, without any prior notice,” he said.
“We pulled out some from under the rubble, but more people are still buried. I don’t know the exact number of casualties, but a whole family was wounded.”

The UN Security Council is set to vote later today on a resolution calling for a pause in the conflict,  diplomatic sources told AFP, after two previous votes were delayed as members wrangled over wording.

The latest version of the text calls for the “suspension” of hostilities, the sources said.
The US vetoed a previous ceasefire resolution, sparking condemnation by aid groups which urged more action to help civilians caught in the conflict.
The UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million residents have been forced to flee their homes, many sheltering in tents amid dire shortages and the biting winter cold.
“Amid displacement at an unimaginable scale and active hostilities, the humanitarian response system is on the brink,” said Tor Wennesland, the UN’s special coordinator for the Middle East peace process.
Israel, which declared a total siege on Gaza at the start of the conflict, has since allowed in aid trucks through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and, as of this week, its own Kerem Shalom crossing.
The UN’s World Food Progamme said today it had delivered food through the crossing in a first direct aid convoy from Jordan.
An Israeli military agency, COGAT, said it had also started laying a pipeline from Egypt to deliver drinking water from a mobile desalination plant in a project led by the United Arab Emirates.
But aid groups have warned  the humanitarian goods fall far short of the dire need, and the UN children’s agency said that “child deaths due to disease could surpass those killed in bombardments”.
The Gaza conflict has sparked fears of regional escalation and seen Israel trade deadly cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, where Israel said its aircraft hit more targets today.
Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels, meanwhile, have repeatedly fired missiles and drones at vessels passing through the Red Sea that they say are linked to Israel, in a show of support for Palestinians.
The United States this week started to build a multinational naval task force to protect the waterway leading to the Suez Canal, through which more than 10 percent of global trade transits.

Irish Palestinians plead for government help to get loved ones out of Gaza,"PALESTINIANS LIVING IN Ireland have made emotional appeals to the Government to do more to secure the safe passage of their loved ones from Gaza.
Several families gathered in Dublin on Tuesday to implore the authorities to help their relatives flee the ongoing Israeli bombardment of the enclave.
The cases highlighted included Irish citizens who have still not managed to get out of Gaza via the Rafah crossing into Egypt.
Others involved Palestinians who have made Ireland home and who are desperately trying to get their loved ones to safety.
Batoul Hania managed to escape Gaza in recent weeks with her four children but her husband, Zak, an Irish passport holder, remains in the region unable to leave.
Her relative, Isra, whom she travelled with and who is an Irish citizen, is in the same situation, with her husband Muhamed also being prevented from leaving.
“I came from there, I came from hell and I know every little thing about that,” said Batoul Hania.
Her family were originally evacuated from north to south Gaza, a journey they had to make on foot.
“It was like going through hell, shattered pieces, blood here and there, the smell of the dead bodies, shooting, queuing us for 45 minutes in the hot sun,” she said.
“Just having the horrifying scenarios that they (Israeli Defence Forces) will grab anyone from us, while queuing in front of their tanks and in front of the horrifying soldiers, who were pointing their rifles against our kids’ faces.”
Ms Hania said the Irish embassy in Cairo helped secure the family a route out via the Rafah crossing.
“We were surprised on the day we had to leave Zak and Muhamed, the men, and just go with the kids,” she said.
“And this was very heart-breaking for us because it’s really splitting families, I know that the Israelis are very, very excellent at this, at splitting families apart.”
She added: “Zak is an Irish citizen, he has the privilege and he has the right to go out – so we still wonder why his name was not on the list.”
Ms Hania is also trying to secure the passage of her parents, Fatima and Abdul Raouf, and her brother, Ahmed.
Fatin Al Tamimi, who has lived in Ireland for 35 years, is trying to get her sister, Heba, and her family out of Gaza. Heba’s home has already been destroyed in the Israeli bombing.

“Because of the destruction and the misery they are living in, she is begging me to leave,” said Ms Al Tamimi.
“I know my sister is not Irish, but I’m Irish and I want her safety. I want to see her safe. I want to see my nieces and nephews safe. I want them out.
“So, please, they (Irish Government) don’t have to bring them to Ireland, they don’t have to accommodate them in any way, just give them the right, safe way to leave Gaza desperately for a better life or to survive.”
Among other cases highlighted at the event were Akram and Hanan Samour whose daughter, Saja, is trapped in Gaza; Nada Musleh whose husband, Abdallah, remains in the enclave; and Nour Ashour who has a number of relatives still in Gaza, including her sister, Aya Al Muhtadi, and their father, Mohammed.
People Before Profit TD, Richard Boyd Barrett, said the Government must initiate an “emergency response” to help get Palestinians with Irish links out of the enclave.
“I think everybody can understand just how serious the situation is and how terrified the families are,” he told reporters at the close of the event at Buswells Hotel, Dublin.
“So, I just want to reiterate the plea that the Government would respond to the families, respond to us and understand that this is not a normal situation.
“And that, you know, talk of long visa processes or any of that, this is totally different.
“The people who have talked to you (at the event) don’t know if their family members will be alive tomorrow and we’re asking for an emergency response from the Government to help them get their family members to safety.
“That’s what we hope will come out of it.”
Ireland’s deputy premier and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin said the Government had not been given reasons why some Irish citizens had not yet been allowed to leave via the Rafah crossing.
He said the Government continued to work to secure the safe passage of Irish citizens and their dependants from Gaza.
“We don’t take these issues lightly,” he said.
“But the bottom line is Israel does have a very strong determining say as to who leaves. The Egyptians also play a role, their role is more on the receiving side of those who are allowed out of Gaza.
“We’re not in control of who eventually gets out. We can make representations, we do everything we can to get Irish citizens out, along with their dependants as well. And it’s a very tragic situation for the families.”
Tanaiste Mr Martin also criticised Mr Boyd Barrett’s stance, claiming he was trying to turn the situation into a “wedge issue” and make it about which party is more pro-Palestinian than the others.
A spokesman for the Tanaiste’s department said: “A small number of Irish citizens remain in Gaza. The Department of Foreign Affairs is continuing to work consistently with the relevant authorities on additional cases where these arise and to assist in instances where other Irish citizens and accompanying dependants wish to exit Gaza.
“Exit from Gaza is subject to the final decision of the relevant local authorities. The relevant authorities have made clear to all countries with citizens in Gaza that the current focus for facilitated departures from Gaza is on foreign and dual nationals and immediate dependants accompanying them.”","10.31pm, 19 Dec 2023",,
UN postpones vote on calls for ceasefire in Gaza for second time,"LAST UPDATE|19 Dec 2023

THE UNITED NATIONS Security Council has postponed its vote on another Gaza ceasefire demand, after it was already rescheduled on Monday to this evening.
Members of the council were struggling to find common ground today, despite the extra day allowed for discussions.
The vote is now due to take place on Wednesday.
A draft of the resolution introduced by the United Arab Emirates called for an “urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities” in Gaza to allow “safe and unhindered humanitarian access”.
Israel has allowed limited humanitarian aid deliveries into Gaza via Egypt’s Rafah border crossing and, as of this week, through its own Kerem Shalom crossing.
There is mounting concern over the conflict’s impact on global shipping.
One of Israel’s enemies, Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels, in recent weeks launched a spate of attacks on cargo ships and tankers in the Red Sea, leading the United States to announce a 10-nation naval coalition to protect the vessels.
The Houthi missile and drone strikes, while claiming no lives so far, have led several major shipping and oil firms to halt voyages through the waters that lead to the Suez Canal, a chokepoint for about 10 percent of world trade.
Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin – who yesterday again pledged “ironclad” US support for Israel – travelled on to Qatar and joined an online conference on the naval coalition that includes warships from Britain, Canada, France and other countries.
The Houthis meanwhile warned they “will not stop” the attacks, which they say target Israel-linked vessels in a show of solidarity with the Palestinians and Islamist militant group Hamas.
Israel maintained its bombardment and ground combat today in the third month of the bloodiest ever Gaza war, which started when Hamas launched their unprecedented attack on 7 October.
The militants burst through the Gaza border fence, killed around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and abducted 250, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry says Israel’s withering military response has killed more than 19,400 people, mostly women and children, while devastating large swathes of the coastal territory.
At least 20 more people were killed overnight in strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the ministry said, bringing more suffering to the area that has become a vast camp for displaced Palestinians.
Israeli forces have taken control of Al Awda hospital in northern Gaza after besieging it for 12 days.
Males over 16-years-old were taken out of the hospital, stripped, bound and interrogated.
Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) says six of its staff were among them. After the interrogations, most of them were sent back into the hospital and told not to move.
Al-Awda hospital still has dozens of patients inside, 14 of whom are children. The hospital is now out of essentials like general anaesthetic and oxygen, MSF report.

Al Awda is the last functioning hospital in the north of Gaza that MSF knows of.
Israel’s military said its troops found explosives planted in a medical clinic in the Gaza City suburb of Shejaiya, destroyed Hamas tunnels and killed Hamas operatives during recent operations.
The Israeli army says 131 of its troops have been killed in Gaza since it launched its ground invasion in late October.
The White House has voiced concern over the high civilian toll in Gaza, but Austin vowed yesterday to keep arming Israel.
“We’ll continue to provide Israel with the equipment that you need to defend your country… including critical munitions, tactical vehicles and air defence systems,” he said.
International alarm has spiralled over the suffering brought by the war and siege for traumatised Palestinian families who have endured dire shortages of food, water, medical supplies and fuel as well as power and communications blackouts.
The New York-based campaign group Human Rights Watch charged yesterday that Israel was “using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare”.
And the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell accused Israel of displaying an “appalling lack of distinction” in its Gaza campaign.
The top concern for many Israelis remains the fate of the 129 hostages still held in Gaza after scores were released last month in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
Hamas’s military wing released footage it claimed showed three of those still held captive – elderly and bearded men sitting on chairs who asked to be released.
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari called it “a criminal terror video that is evidence of Hamas’s brutality toward innocent elderly civilians who need medical attention”.
The fear and anger of hostages’ families intensified after Israeli soldiers last week mistakenly shot dead three captives who had escaped and were waving white flags.
Qatar, which helped mediate the previous week-long truce and hostage-prisoner exchange, has said there are “ongoing diplomatic efforts to renew the humanitarian pause”.
US news platform Axios reported Monday that Israel’s top spy, Mossad chief David Barnea, CIA director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani had met in Warsaw.
Hamas has insisted it “is ready for a prisoner exchange deal, but after a ceasefire” — while Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and its infrastructure to avoid a repeat of the 7 October attacks.
The Gaza war has sparked fears of regional escalation and seen Israel trade deadly cross-border fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon.
The Houthi attacks have also intensified on the crucial maritime artery for an estimated 40 percent of Europe-Asia trade.
Four of the world’s biggest shipping companies – CMA CGM Group, Hapag-Lloyd, Maersk and MSC – have halted operations there or started to re-route their vessels, as has oil giant BP, in a move that sent up energy prices.
Voyages rerouted around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope can take around 10 days longer, piling on fuel costs and threatening delays and supply shortages that can drive up consumer prices.

Freight expert on Red Sea attacks: Hope it's not an 'Ever Given' scenario but potentially a big issue,"A LEADING IRISH global supply chain business has expressed hope that attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on cargo ships passing through the Red Sea wont create an ‘Ever Given’ situation.
It was estimated the the blockage of the 400 metre long Ever Given along the Suez Canal in 2021held up $9.6 billion-worth of cargo between Asia and Europe for each day it was stuck.
However, Kevin Brady of Woodland Group noted that it could be a “potentially big issue” and that the attacks will cause at least a two-week delay on goods entering Ireland.
Goods on cargo ships from Asia that are destined for Ireland pass through Egypt’s Suez Canal, before landing in European ports.
From there, the goods are placed on smaller vessels which set sail to Ireland.
However, cargo ships are now tracing the west coast of Africa as opposed to travelling up the Red Sea towards the Suez Canal as a result of the Houthi attacks.
The Iran-backed Houthis say their missile and drone strikes are in support of Palestinians in the Gaza war raging between Israel and Hamas since 7 October.
The Houthis, a Shiite Islamist movement which controls much of western Yemen including the capital Sana’a, have said they will only halt attacks if Israel’s “crimes in Gaza stop and food, medicine and fuel are allowed to reach its besieged population”.
According to the Pentagon, Houthi rebels have launched more than 100 drone and missile attacks, targeting 10 merchant vessels involving more than 35 different countries.

“It’s a deteriorating situation,” said Kevin Brady, director of global development at Woodland Group, which has 30 years’ experience in ocean freight.
“Effectively, all the main carriers and firms have decided, due to the safety of crews and also the cargo on board, that with missiles being fired they’re going to turn the vessels and bring them around the Cape of Good Hope.”
The Red Sea leads to the Suez Canal, a chokepoint for about 10% of global trade.
Last month, the rebels seized the Galaxy Leader merchant vessel, taking its 25-member crew hostage. Both the vessel and crew remain in Yemen.
Brady said this rerouting around the southern tip of Africa will add “between 10 and 14 days to cargo ships entering European ports”.
“From an Irish point of view,” explained Brady, “all of those vessels have got to go into the European port, there’s no direct services coming into Ireland.
“With immediate effect, anything that is south of the Suez Canal and hasn’t gone through, it’s a 10-to-14-day delay on anything on those vessels.”
He added that this will then cause congestion at European hubs, which could in turn result in further delays.

“The containers for Ireland have to be unloaded at European ports, put on a smaller vessel and then brought into the Irish ports.
“So it’s a minimum of a two-week delay but then we can expect further delays because of congestion in European ports,” said Brady.
“This is the fastest route into Europe, and we’re all at the mercy of this situation.”
Insurance costs have soared and the need to re-route vessels around the southern tip of Africa is resulting in higher fuel costs due to the much longer voyages.
Oil giant BP is among the carriers to have re-routed voyages, a move that sent up energy prices.
“Without doubt this is going to result in surcharges as well,” said Brady.
“There could be war-risk surcharges and other surcharges, so it’s not just the physical delay, there will be rate increases.”
Brady also noted that the vessels operate like “clockwork” and that once taken out of this tight schedule, it’s “very difficult to get them back onto it”.
“I don’t want to come across too negatively,” said Brady, “but these are the facts at the minute and there will undoubtedly be knock-on effects.
“Services are not going to be on schedule, so there’s going to be a delay and a buildup of cargo in the major China ports and Southeast Asian ports.
“This takes up space because if the vessels are late, pools of containers will gather in the ports in China, and then there are no vessels carrying empty containers back, so it’s a bit of a vicious circle.”

In March 2021, the 400 metre long Ever Given cargo ship became wedged diagonally across the Suez Canal, shutting the waterway in both directions.
It was on its way to the Dutch port of Rotterdam on 23 March, 2021, when it slammed into the bank of a single-lane stretch of the Suez Canal about 3.7 miles north of the southern entrance.
It held up an estimated $9.6 billion-worth (€8,75b) of cargo between Asia and Europe each day it was stuck.

“We don’t want to sound alarmist and we hope it won’t be a Covid or Ever Given situation but as long as that threat and risk is there, it’s down to whether those carriers will put vessels through this region,” said Brady.
“It’s potentially a big issue and the longer that goes on, the bigger the effect is going to be on the supply chain.”
Brady also remarked that while most people thought the issues caused by the Ever Given were solved upon its release, “that’s just when the problems started”.
“It’s the disruption to the schedule in these vessels, and these big vessels are like clockwork.
“Even with the disruption as it is now, the vessels will be delayed a minimum of two weeks in getting back to China, even before there is any further impact in European ports.
“And it’s the run-up to Chinese New Year on 10 February, there will normally be a peak to Chinese New Year and that needs to be considered as well.
“If the vessels are late getting back, then empty equipment is not there for new cargo, you can see the knock-on effect.”
The United States yesterday pushed to build up a multinational naval task force to protect the key shipping lane from Houthi rebels.
The group includes the United States, United Kingdom, Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Seychelles and Spain.
The Pentagon has convinced allies to join a naval task force in the Red Sea amid mounting attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial shippingAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
However, Houthi rebels yesterday pledged to continue the attacks.
“Even if America succeeds in mobilising the entire world, our military operations will not stop… no matter the sacrifices it costs us,” senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said on X, formerly Twitter.
Brady questioned if this deterrent will be big enough to ward off further attacks and added: “All we all we can do is watch this space closely and talk with clients constantly and update them.
“A two or three-week delay, a lot of them can handle that, but it’s extra costs once the surcharges go up from 1 January.”
Analysts have also warned that the maritime task force can do little to halt the attacks by the Houthis, who command an arsenal of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones.
“The Houthis have an extended arsenal of different drones and missiles that they can shoot… and some of them will be difficult to intercept by your average navy ship,” Andreas Krieg, a professor at King’s College London, told AFP.
Meanwhile, the Houthis have remained defiant and threatened to attack ships of any country that acts against them.
Other than ocean freight, companies can use rail or air services.
“The longer it goes then people will want those air and rail services, especially for urgent supply chains,” said Brady, “but they’re finite services and they don’t have the capacity or space you would have on an ocean service.
“Hopefully if this can be nipped in the bud it won’t become too much of an issue.
“But it’s supply and demand, if there’s pressure on any of those services and that demand goes up, invariably the price will go up as well.
“Is the deterrent big enough with these warships going into the area, are these rebels going to go away, I don’t think it’s an answer any of us can give, it’s out of our control.”
Brady also noted that while freight rates – which take account of fuel costs, insurance premiums and other charges – are “at a pretty low level at the minute”, he is anticipating a large increase from 1 January,
“There will be extra costs, be it a war-risk or just an emergency surcharge,” said Brady.
“It’s very concerning, without doubt there will be delays and extra costs involved, it’s now just about getting a handle on what that will look like.
“Hopefully this threat reduces but it’s certainly going to be a big challenge.
“Disruption to supply chains, extra costs involved, certainly not a very nice entry into the new year.”

Fears of major global trade disruption because of attacks on Red Sea cargo ships,"RECENT WEEKS HAVE seen Yemen’s Houthi rebels escalate their attacks on cargo ships and tankers passing through the Red Sea. Five of the world’s six largest shipping companies have halted operations in the area as a result.
The Houthis, who control much of western Yemen including the capital Sana’a, have declared their support for Palestine and promised to attack any Israel-bound ship that passes through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, which connects the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea and facilitates about 12% of global trade.
Today, the Houthis announced they would not halt attacks on Red Sea shipping following an announcement by the United States of a new 11-nation maritime force aimed at countering them.
The group said the attacks will continue until sufficient aid is allowed to enter Gaza.
“Even if America succeeds in mobilising the entire world, our military operations will not stop… no matter the sacrifices it costs us,” senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said on X, formerly Twitter.
The Houthi’s military spokesperson Yahya Sare’e has made similar statements on X.

1-With the help of God Almighty, the naval forces of the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a specific military operation against two ships linked to the Zionist entity. The first was the oil carrier “Swan Atlantic”, and the other was the “MSC Clara” ship, carrying containers.
However, Norway’s Inventor Chemical Tankers said in a statement that its ship, which was attacked on Friday, was carrying biofuel feedstock from France to Reunion Island.
It said the vessel has “no Israeli link” and was managed by a Singaporean firm, adding that the Indian crew were unharmed and the vessel sustained limited damage.
The US-led security coalition was announced yesterday by defence secretary Lloyd Austin, who said it will operate “with the goal of ensuring freedom of navigation for all countries and bolstering regional security and prosperity”.

The group includes the United States, United Kingdom, Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Seychelles and Spain, Austin said.
Notably, Bahrain is the only country in the region to join the force. This is despite fellow Arab states Saudi Arabia and the UAE fighting against the Houthis – with US and UK support – as recently as April last year.

On Saturday, a US destroyer shot down 14 drones in the Red Sea launched from rebel-controlled areas of Yemen, the US military said.
Britain said one of its destroyers had also brought down a suspected attack drone in the area.
Yesterday, British oil giant BP became the latest company to suspend transit through the Red Sea, while Taiwanese shipping firm Evergreen said it was suspending its Israeli cargo shipments with immediate effect.
Frontline, one of the world’s largest tanker companies, also said it was rerouting ships and would “only allow new business” that could be routed via South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, a much longer and more costly route.
These suspensions follow similar announcements from shipping companies Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, which both said they were pausing operations on Friday in response to drone attacks on two ships in the strait. Maersk alone accounts for about 15% of global container freight.
In response to the uncertain situation, insurance companies have significantly increased premiums on ships, making it prohibitive for some to pass through the commercially vital Suez Canal.
Italian-Swiss giant Mediterranean Shipping Company, France’s CMA CGM and Belgium’s Euronav have also halted voyages through the Red Sea.

The attacks have become “a maritime security crisis” with “commercial and economic implications in the region and beyond”, Torbjorn Soltvedt of analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft told AFP.
The Houthis, a Shiite Islamist movement, are supported by regional power Iran.
US officials have made it clear they believe Iran is behind the attacks, with US national security advisor Jake Sullivan saying last week that “while the Houthis are pulling the trigger, so to speak, they’re being handed the gun by Iran”.
Yesterday, Austin said that “Iran’s support for the Houthi attacks on commercial vessels must stop”.

Former president Mary Robinson says Joe Biden is ‘losing respect’ due to his position on Gaza,"FORMER PRESIDENT Mary Robinson has said US president Joe Biden is “losing respect all over the world” due to his “support for Israel”.
Robinson made the remarksahead of a UN Security Council vote calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
The Security Council is also discussing the terms of a monitoring system for humanitarian aid entering Gaza.
Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, the Security Council has only managed to adopt a text calling for “humanitarian pauses” in mid-November.
Five other draft resolutions were rejected, two of them due to US vetoes.
Robinson said such vetoes are “making the world less safe, the Security Council less effective, and US leadership less respected”.
US President Joe Biden has exhibited growing impatience with Israel, warning that its ally risks losing the support of the international community for its “indiscriminate” bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
However, his administration yesterday vowed that it would continue to arm Israel in its campaign against Hamas, even as it called for more humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the devastated Gaza Strip.

In a statement ahead of today’s vote, Robinson said “Biden’s support for Israel’s indiscriminate bombing of Gaza is losing him respect all over the world”.
She added that the US is “increasingly isolated” in its position and “cannot afford to be further isolated by vetoing this resolution” which will be voted on later.
However, Robinson remarked that “even if passed, such resolutions are not enough”.
She added that the UN Security Council Resolution 2712 that was agreed last month “is not being fully implemented”.
This resolution, which the United States abstained from, called for “called for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors through the Gaza Strip to facilitate the provision of essential goods and services”.
Robinson said “only a ceasefire will allow for these calls to be met”.
She also noted that “Israeli military action has caused the deaths of Israeli hostages, as well as thousands of Palestinian civilians”.
Israeli soldiers shot dead three hostages last Friday – an Israeli military official said the incident was “against our rules of engagement” and that an investigation is ongoing at the “highest level”.
Gaza’s health ministry says Israel’s military has killed more than 19,400 people, mostly women and children, while reducing vast areas to rubble.

Israel continues to bomb Gaza as it faces accusation it is 'starving' Palestinians,"LAST UPDATE|18 Dec 2023
ISRAEL HAS KEPT up heavy bombing of Gaza today as it faces accusations from a human rights group that it is deliberately starving Palestinians in its campaign sparked by the 7 October Hamas attacks.
Fighting raged on in the third month of the bloodiest ever Gaza conflict, with the Gaza health ministry reporting another 110 people killed in strikes on Jabalia since Sunday.
The UN Security Council in New York is set to vote later in the day on another call for a ceasefire in the besieged territory, after previous bids were vetoed by the United States – a key ally of Israel.
And Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin is expected back in Israel today as part of a Middle East tour aimed at stopping the conflict from spreading further.
The conflict broke out when Gaza’s Islamist rulers Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on 7 October, killing around 1,140 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Hamas militants also abducted 250 hostages, some of whom are still being held in Gaza.
Gaza’s health ministry says Israel’s military response has killed more than 18,800 people, mostly women and children, while vast areas of the enclave have been reduced to rubble.
International alarm has mounted over the plight of 2.4 million Gazans now enduring bombardment, food and water shortages, mass displacement and plummeting winter temperatures.
The New York-based campaign group Human Rights Watch claims that Israel “is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in the occupied Gaza Strip, which is a war crime”.
“Israeli forces are deliberately blocking the delivery of water, food and fuel, while wilfully impeding humanitarian assistance, apparently razing agricultural areas, and depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to their survival,” it wrote in a report.
The Israeli government hit back, accusing HRW of being an “anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli organisation”.
“Human Rights Watch [...] did not condemn the attack on Israeli citizens and the massacre of October 7 and has no moral basis to talk about what’s going on in Gaza if they turn a blind eye to the suffering and the human rights of Israelis,” foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat told the AFP news agency.

The Human Rights Watch report says: “The Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel on October 7 killed at least 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals, with more than 200 people taken hostage, acts amounting to war crimes.”
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, earlier said that he “would not be surprised if people start dying of hunger, or a combination of hunger, disease, weak immunity”.
Israel has approved aid deliveries into Gaza via its Kerem Shalom crossing, aside from the Rafah crossing with Egypt, and a first truck convoy passed through Kerem yesterday, an Egyptian Red Crescent official who asked not to be named told AFP.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday vowed that Israel will “fight until the end” and eliminate Hamas, free the remaining captured hostages and ensure that Gaza will never again become “a centre for terrorism”.
The Israeli army has reported 127 deaths in Gaza since it launched ground operations in late October.
Israel has accused Hamas of hiding among civilians and in tunnels underneath hospitals, schools, mosques and other civilian infrastructure.
It released a report yesterday of part of a vast Hamas tunnel network, big enough to drive vehicles through, featuring rails, power lines, drainage systems and a communications network.
In an interview with RTÉ’s Morning Ireland today, the emergencies director of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Mike Ryan, spoke of the claims that Hamas is using healthcare facilities.
“The claims from the Israeli government and IDF have been around the use of tunnels and they explained that there’s a tunnel network all over Gaza, it’s everywhere,” Ryan said.
“The reality is that what’s above the ground are doctors, nurses, sheltering internally displaced persons and thousands of patients.
“That’s what we know. The doctors and nurses are there trying to save lives, our job is to supply them, our job is to assist them in saving lives.
“Even if a facility is used, I’m not saying that they are being used, but even if the facility is being misused and we condemn the misuse of health facilities across the board, even if it is the opposing forces must show precaution and they must show proportionality and we’re not seeing that right now.
“What we’re seeing is health systems being targeted. I’ve never seen anything like this before.”

Israel has faced mounting global pressure to either slow, suspend or stop hostilities – including from families of the remaining 129 hostages believed held in Gaza.

The families’ anger and fear intensified after Israeli forces mistakenly shot dead three hostages who had escaped their captors inside Gaza.
The trio had waved white flags and had used food leftovers to write a Hebrew-language message on a white sheet before they were shot, reports said.
Army chief of staff Herzi Halevi, in a message to troops, stressed that if enemy fighters “lay down their arms and raise their hands, we capture them, we don’t shoot them”.
“We extract a lot of intelligence from the captives we have, we already have over 1,000.”
Qatar helped mediate a week-long truce last month that saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 jailed Palestinians.
The Gulf country said there are “ongoing diplomatic efforts to renew the humanitarian pause”. News reports said Mossad chief David Barnea met Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in a European city.
As the Gaza conflict rages on, special concern has focused on hospitals, most of which no longer function, and several of which have been the scenes of major fighting.
The UN Security Council is due to vote on a new resolution calling for an “urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities” in Gaza.
Washington previously blocked similar UNSC resolutions, while the wider General Assembly has voted for an end to fighting, with 153 out of 193 members in favour.
Fears have grown that the conflict could escalate with more of Israel’s enemies, a grouping of Iran-backed armed forces in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
Yemen’s Huthi rebels have targeted Israel with missiles and fired at passing ships in the Red Sea in a show of solidarity with Hamas.
The series of attacks has led a number of major shipping companies to avoid the maritime chokepoint and redirect their vessels around Africa, a longer and far more costly route.

Killed Israeli hostage's brother says army 'abandoned and murdered' him,"
AN ISRAELI HOSTAGE who was mistakenly killed by soldiers in the Gaza Strip this week was buried today, with his brother slamming the army for having “abandoned and murdered” him.
Alon Shamriz, 26, was one of the three Israeli hostages shot dead by soldiers during an operation in the Gaza City suburb of Shejaiya, even as they carried a white flag andcried for help in Hebrew.
Shamriz, Yotam Haim and Samer El-Talalqa were killed when troops mistook them for a threat and opened fire, the army said.
“Those who abandoned you also murdered you after all that you did right,” Ido, brother of Shamriz said at the funeral in kibbutz Shefayim north of Tel Aviv attended by dozens of relatives and family members.

“You survived 70 days in hell,” Shamriz’s mother, Dikla, said in her eulogy. “Another moment and you would have been in my arms.”
Israeli media reported that Talalqa was buried on Saturday, while the funeral for Haim was scheduled on Monday.
The deaths of the three men, all in their 20s, have sparked protests in Tel Aviv as demonstrators demanded that the authorities offer a new plan for bringing home the remaining hostages held in the Gaza Strip.
‘Violation of rules’
Military spokesman Richard Hecht today said the deaths were being investigated and what the soldiers did was “violation of the rules of engagement”.
Some 250 people were taken hostage when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to updated Israeli figures.

"Israel says it has found large tunnel at Gaza border, raising pre-war intelligence questions","THE ISRAELI MILITARY said it has discovered a large tunnel shaft in Gaza close to what was once a busy crossing into Israel, raising new questions about how Israeli surveillance missed such conspicuous preparations by Hamas for the militants’ deadly 7 October assault.
The entryway to the tunnel is just a few hundred metres from the heavily fortified Erez crossing and a nearby Israeli military base.
The military said it stretches for more than 2.5 miles, links up with a sprawling tunnel network across Gaza and is wide enough for cars to pass through.
The army said on Sunday that the tunnel facilitated the transit of vehicles, militants, and supplies in preparation for the 7 October attack.
That day, militants used a rocket-propelled grenade to break past the portion of wall close to the Erez crossing and stormed the base, killing at least three soldiers and kidnapping some back to Gaza, the army said.
It was one of several places along the border wall where militants easily blew past Israel’s security defences, entered Israeli territory and killed some 1,200 people and took about 240 others hostage.
The unprecedented attack triggered a devastating war that has raged for over 10 weeks and claimed over 18,000 lives in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian health officials.

Israel says destruction of Hamas’ tunnel network is a major objective and that much of the underground network runs beneath schools, hospitals and residential areas.
Israel’s military, intelligence and political officials have come under heavy criticism for failing to detect the attack ahead of time.
Located under a garage
Major Nir Dinar, a military spokesperson, said that Israeli security services did not know about the tunnel before 7 October because Israel’s border defences only detected tunnels meant to enter Israel.
“As far as I know, this tunnel doesn’t cross from Gaza into Israel and stops within 400 metres from the border, which means the indicators won’t indicate that a tunnel is being built,” Major Dinar said.
He added that the entrance, a circular cement opening leading to a cavernous passageway, was located under a garage, hiding it from Israeli drones and satellite images.
While the military was aware that Hamas had an extensive tunnel network, Major Dinar said they did not think the militants would be able to carry out their plans for a large-scale attack.

“It’s no surprise that this was the Hamas strategy all along,” he said. “The surprise is that they have succeeded and the size of this tunnel … was really shocking.”
The Erez crossing, a fortress-like facility that processed the movement of Palestinians into Israel for work, medical care and transit to neighbouring Jordan, held great symbolic value for Hamas.
The massive crossing was protected by security cameras and military patrols and the adjacent military base. The crossing suffered heavy damage on 7 October and has not reopened.
The army said its Yahalom unit, which specialises in tunnel warfare, has worked to excavate the tunnel since it was first detected. They say they have found weapons inside.
“At this point, this is the biggest tunnel in Gaza,” Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, told reporters in a tour of the tunnel’s entrance on Friday.
It is unclear if the tunnel was used on 7 October.
Set ablaze
The army also showed reporters soldiers’ barracks at the nearby base that it said were set ablaze by the militants. They looked like the ashes of a furnace, with blackened walls and smelted bunks.
The military announced on Friday that it had recovered in Gaza the bodies of two soldiers who were working at the base on 7 October.
Major Dinar, who visited the tunnel on Friday, said it was twice the height and three times the width of other tunnels found in Gaza. He said it is equipped with ventilation and electricity and dives 50 metres underground in some points.
He said it was clear that millions of dollars as well as a great deal of fuel and workforce had been needed to build and sustain the tunnel.
Rear Admiral Hagari said the military planned to destroy the tunnel and continue to “hunt” militants hiding in others.
“We will hunt them even if we need to go down to the tunnels,” he said. “We also need to do it with attention to the rescue of our hostages and the understanding that maybe some of them are in the tunnels.”
Israel is coming under increasing pressure to scale back its combat operations in Gaza, amid growing anger about conduct by its army in the region.

ISRAEL IS COMING under further pressure to scale back its combat operations in Gaza, amid growing anger about conduct by its army in the region.
Foreign ministers for Germany, France and the UK have urged a ceasefire, but Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has told a nationwide address that he is “committed as ever” to the war.
UK foreign secretary David Cameron, writing in a joint Sunday Times article with the German Foreign Affairs minister Annalena Baerbock, called for a “sustainable” ceasefire in the conflict, as he warned that “too many civilians have been killed” by Israel.
The two senior politicians say that neither the UK nor Germany is calling for an immediate ceasefire, but the call for a “sustainable” ceasing of conflict is a significant shift in language by the UK Government.
They wrote: “Our goal cannot simply be an end to fighting today. It must be peace lasting for days, years, generations. We therefore support a ceasefire, but only if it is sustainable.
“We know many in the region and beyond have been calling for an immediate ceasefire. We recognise what motivates these heartfelt calls.
“It is an understandable reaction to such intense suffering, and we share the view that this conflict cannot drag on and on.”
Elsewhere, their French counterpart Catherine Colonna today pressed for an “immediate and durable” truce in the Gaza war, saying “too many civilians are being killed” in the Palestinian territory.
However, the UK government’s deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden carried a different message to Cameron’s call, when he told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that in order for a ceasefire to be sustainable, “we have to ensure we remove the threat of Hamas from Israel, and indeed the wider Middle East”.
He added: “So, that’s why we continue to support Israel in its right to self-defence, to remove the threat of Hamas, and at the same time to get those hostages back. Those are the two things that ensure we have a sustainable ceasefire.”
Israel has pressed ahead with its Gaza offensive today after a series of shootings, including of three hostages who were shirtless and waving a white flag, raised questions about its conduct in the 10-week-old war that has brought unprecedented death and destruction to the coastal enclave.
Gaza remained under a communications blackout for a fourth straight day – the longest of several outages over the course of the war, which aid groups say complicate rescue efforts after bombings and make it even more difficult to monitor the war’s toll on civilians.
In his nationwide address last night to Israeli citizens, Netanyahu said the killing of the hostages by his own army “broke my heart, broke the entire nation’s heart,” but he indicated no change in Israel’s military campaign.

“We are as committed as ever to continue until the end, until we dismantle Hamas, until we return all our hostages,” Netanyahu said last night.
Anger over the mistaken killings is likely to increase pressure on the Israeli government to renew Qatar-mediated negotiations with Hamas over swapping more of the remaining captives, which Israel says number 129, for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.
A senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, reiterated that there will be no further hostage releases until the war ends and Israel accepts the militant group’s conditions for an exchange.
Netanyahu said Israel would never agree to such demands.
Israel’s account of how the three hostages – Alon Shamriz, Samer Al-Talalka and Yotam Haim – were killed also raised questions about its soldiers’ conduct. Palestinians on several occasions have said Israeli soldiers opened fire as civilians tried to flee to safety. Hamas has claimed other hostages were previously killed by Israeli fire or air strikes, without presenting evidence.

An Israeli military official said the hostages had likely been abandoned by their captors or had escaped. The soldiers’ behaviour was “against our rules of engagement”, the official said, and was being investigated at the highest level.
The hostages did everything they could to signal they were not a threat, “but this shooting was done during fighting and under pressure,” Herzi Halevi, chief of the military’s general staff said.
Mr Halevi added: “There may be additional incidents in which hostages will escape or will be abandoned during the fighting. We have the obligation and the responsibility to get them out alive.”
The hostages, all in their 20s, were killed on Friday in the Gaza City area of Shijaiyah, where troops are engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas. They had been among more than 240 people taken hostage during an unprecedented raid by Hamas into Israel on October 7 in which around 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians.
Speaking at a rally in Tel Aviv, Rubi Chen, father of 19-year-old hostage Itay Chen, criticised the government for believing hostages can be retrieved through military pressure. “Put the the best offer on the table to get the hostages home alive,” he said. “We don’t want them back in bags.”
The Israeli military official said the three hostages had emerged from a building close to Israeli soldiers’ positions. They waved a white flag and were shirtless, possibly trying to signal they posed no threat.
Two were killed immediately, and the third ran back into the building screaming for help in Hebrew. The commander issued an order to cease fire, but another burst of gunfire killed the third man, the official said.
Israeli media gave a more detailed account. Daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot said that according to an investigation into the incident, soldiers followed the third man and shouted at him to come out, and at least one soldier shot him when he emerged from a staircase.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said the soldiers who followed the third hostage believed he was a Hamas member. Local media reported that soldiers earlier saw a nearby building marked “SOS” and “Help! Three hostages” but feared it might be a trap.

Dahlia Scheindlin, an political analyst, said it was unlikely the killings would massively alter public support for the war. Most Israelis still have a strong sense of why it is being fought and believe Hamas needs to be defeated, she said.
“They feel like there’s no other choice,” she said.
The killings emphasised the dangers hostages face in areas of house-to-house combat like Shijaiyah, where nine soldiers were killed this week in one of the war’s deadliest days for Israeli ground forces. The military has said Hamas has booby-trapped buildings and ambushed troops from a tunnel network it built under Gaza City.
On Saturday, the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum asserted that another hostage, 27-year-old Inbar Hayman, had been killed in Gaza. The group gave no details.
Hamas released over 100 hostages for Palestinian prisoners during a brief ceasefire in November. Nearly all freed on both sides were women and minors. Talks on further swaps broke down.
Hamas seeks the return of all Palestinian prisoners. As of late November, Israel held nearly 7,000 Palestinians accused or convicted of security offences, including hundreds rounded up since the war began.
The war has flattened much of northern Gaza and driven 85% of the territory’s population of 2.3 million from their homes. Only a trickle of aid has been able to enter Gaza. Israel has said it would open a second entry point at Kerem Shalom to speed up deliveries.
The offensive has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Thursday. It does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.
It was the ministry’s last update before the latest communications blackout in Gaza. “Now 48 hours and counting. The incident is likely to limit reporting and visibility to events on the ground,” said Alp Toker, director of NetBlocks, a group tracking internet outages.
The war has been deadly for journalists. Mourners held funeral prayers for Samer Abu Daqqa, a Palestinian journalist working for broadcaster Al Jazeera who was killed on Friday in an Israeli strike. The Committee to Protect Journalists said the cameraman was the 64th journalist to be killed in the conflict: 57 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese.
The United States, Israel’s closest ally, has expressed unease over Israel’s failure to reduce civilian casualties, but the White House continues to offer support with weapons shipments and diplomatic backing.
Israel and the US remain far apart on who should run Gaza after the war. Washington wants to see a unified Palestinian government in Gaza and the West Bank as a precursor to eventual Palestinian statehood. A two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict enjoys broad international support.
Netanyahu reiterated yesterday that Israel will retain security in a demilitarized Gaza and that a Palestinian state would pose a threat to Israel. “I am proud to have prevented the establishment of a Palestinian state,” he said.
US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin is travelling to Israel to continue discussions on a timetable for winding down the war’s intense combat phase. But Netanyahu and military leaders vowed to continue until “complete victory”, which the prime minister noted will take time.","7.39am, 17 Dec 2023",,
EU launches probe into Elon Musk's X over disinformation related to 7 October Hamas attack,"
THE EU HAS announced “formal infringement proceedings” against Elon Musk’s X platform under a law cracking down on illegal online content, after identifying disinformation related to Hamas’s 7 October attack in Israel.
The action against the company formerly known as Twitter is the first against a major online platform since Brussels implemented the Digital Services Act (DSA), a sweeping piece of European Union legislation that strengthens online companies’ responsibility for content moderation.
“Today’s opening of formal proceedings against X makes it clear that, with the DSA, the time of big online platforms behaving like they are ‘too big to care’ has come to an end,” said the bloc’s digital enforcer, EU commissioner Thierry Breton.
“We will now start an in-depth investigation of X’s compliance with the DSA obligations concerning countering the dissemination and amplification of illegal content and disinformation in the EU, transparency of the platforms and design of the user interface.”
The European Commission said a preliminary information-gathering investigation it launched against X in October, which included looking at “the dissemination of illegal content in the context of Hamas’ terrorist attacks against Israel”, led to today’s probe.
On the basis of that information, “the Commission has decided to open formal infringement proceedings against X under the Digital Services Act”, it said.
The formal probe will examine four areas: the dissemination of illegal content; the effectiveness of X’s efforts to combat disinformation; suspected restrictions on giving researchers access to its data; and suspected deceptive practices – known as “dark patterns” – related to its Blue Tick subscription product.
In the event of proven infringements, the DSA carries penalties that can include fines going up to six percent of an online company’s global revenues.

For serious and repeated violations, the EU can ban a platform operating in the 27-nation bloc.
The commission said that, under the formal probe against X, it would now “continue to gather evidence, for example by sending additional requests for information, conducting interviews or inspections”.
It noted that the proceedings gave it powers to order X to undertake interim or remedial steps, pending the conclusion of the probe.
There is no deadline for the proceedings to wrap up.
Weeks after starting its initial information-gathering exercise against X, the commission also launched preliminary investigations along the same lines against TikTok, YouTube and Facebook owner Meta.
Those investigations also looked at how the platforms handled disinformation and illegal content related to the Hamas attack.
The Hamas attack on 7 October killed around 1,140 people in Israel, most of them civilians, and took an estimated 240 people hostage, according to updated Israeli figures.
Israel retaliated with an intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by Hamas.
More than 18,800 Palestinians – around 70% of them women, young children and adolescents – have been killed in the Gaza Strip in Israeli bombardments since 7 October, according to the Hamas government’s health ministry, and much of the besieged territory has been reduced to rubble.

"Israel says it has found large tunnel at Gaza border, raising pre-war intelligence questions","THE ISRAELI MILITARY said it has discovered a large tunnel shaft in Gaza close to what was once a busy crossing into Israel, raising new questions about how Israeli surveillance missed such conspicuous preparations by Hamas for the militants’ deadly 7 October assault.
The entryway to the tunnel is just a few hundred metres from the heavily fortified Erez crossing and a nearby Israeli military base.
The military said it stretches for more than 2.5 miles, links up with a sprawling tunnel network across Gaza and is wide enough for cars to pass through.
The army said on Sunday that the tunnel facilitated the transit of vehicles, militants, and supplies in preparation for the 7 October attack.
That day, militants used a rocket-propelled grenade to break past the portion of wall close to the Erez crossing and stormed the base, killing at least three soldiers and kidnapping some back to Gaza, the army said.
It was one of several places along the border wall where militants easily blew past Israel’s security defences, entered Israeli territory and killed some 1,200 people and took about 240 others hostage.
The unprecedented attack triggered a devastating war that has raged for over 10 weeks and claimed over 18,000 lives in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian health officials.

Israel says destruction of Hamas’ tunnel network is a major objective and that much of the underground network runs beneath schools, hospitals and residential areas.
Israel’s military, intelligence and political officials have come under heavy criticism for failing to detect the attack ahead of time.
Located under a garage
Major Nir Dinar, a military spokesperson, said that Israeli security services did not know about the tunnel before 7 October because Israel’s border defences only detected tunnels meant to enter Israel.
“As far as I know, this tunnel doesn’t cross from Gaza into Israel and stops within 400 metres from the border, which means the indicators won’t indicate that a tunnel is being built,” Major Dinar said.
He added that the entrance, a circular cement opening leading to a cavernous passageway, was located under a garage, hiding it from Israeli drones and satellite images.
While the military was aware that Hamas had an extensive tunnel network, Major Dinar said they did not think the militants would be able to carry out their plans for a large-scale attack.

“It’s no surprise that this was the Hamas strategy all along,” he said. “The surprise is that they have succeeded and the size of this tunnel … was really shocking.”
The Erez crossing, a fortress-like facility that processed the movement of Palestinians into Israel for work, medical care and transit to neighbouring Jordan, held great symbolic value for Hamas.
The massive crossing was protected by security cameras and military patrols and the adjacent military base. The crossing suffered heavy damage on 7 October and has not reopened.
The army said its Yahalom unit, which specialises in tunnel warfare, has worked to excavate the tunnel since it was first detected. They say they have found weapons inside.
“At this point, this is the biggest tunnel in Gaza,” Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, told reporters in a tour of the tunnel’s entrance on Friday.
It is unclear if the tunnel was used on 7 October.
Set ablaze
The army also showed reporters soldiers’ barracks at the nearby base that it said were set ablaze by the militants. They looked like the ashes of a furnace, with blackened walls and smelted bunks.
The military announced on Friday that it had recovered in Gaza the bodies of two soldiers who were working at the base on 7 October.
Major Dinar, who visited the tunnel on Friday, said it was twice the height and three times the width of other tunnels found in Gaza. He said it is equipped with ventilation and electricity and dives 50 metres underground in some points.
He said it was clear that millions of dollars as well as a great deal of fuel and workforce had been needed to build and sustain the tunnel.
Rear Admiral Hagari said the military planned to destroy the tunnel and continue to “hunt” militants hiding in others.
“We will hunt them even if we need to go down to the tunnels,” he said. “We also need to do it with attention to the rescue of our hostages and the understanding that maybe some of them are in the tunnels.”
Israel is coming under increasing pressure to scale back its combat operations in Gaza, amid growing anger about conduct by its army in the region.
Foreign ministers for Germany, France and the UK have urged a ceasefire, but Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu told a nationwide address he is as“committed as ever”to the war.","5.25pm, 17 Dec 2023",,
Pope deplores deaths of mother and daughter reportedly killed by Israeli army in Gaza parish,"LAST UPDATE|17 Dec 2023

POPE FRANCIS HAS deplored the deaths of two women in a Catholic parish in Gaza, where he said “defenceless civilians” were targeted by shootings and bombings.
A mother and daughter were shot dead by an Israeli soldier on the grounds of a Catholic church in Gaza City yesterday, according to the church-aligned Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem.
“I continue to receive very serious and painful news from Gaza,” he said at the end of the Angelus prayer. “A mother and her daughter… were killed and other people injured by sniper fire.”
“This happened even inside the parish of the Holy Family where there are no terrorists, but families, children, sick or disabled people,” the pope stressed.
Around 10am GMT yesterday, “a sniper of the IDF (Israeli army) murdered two Christian women inside the Holy Family Parish in Gaza,” the patriarchate said in a statement.
Christian families have been sheltering on the church grounds since war between Israel and Hamas war broke out.
The killings come as public anger mounts in Israel over its army shooting dead three Israeli hostages who were possibly trying to escape to safety. A preliminary IDF investigation said the three young men were shot even as they carried a makeshift white flag and cried for help in Hebrew.
“Nahida and her daughter Samar were shot and killed as they walked to the Sister’s Convent. One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety,” it added.
Seven more people were wounded by gunfire as they tried to protect others, the statement said.

According to the Vatican press agency, citing Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, the victims were an elderly woman and her daughter.
Approached for comment, the Israeli army said it was looking into the incident, which took place on the grounds of the Gaza Strip’s only Catholic church.
The patriarchate said no warning was given before the shooting started, adding: “They were shot in cold blood inside the premises of the Parish, where there are no belligerents.”
In its statement, the patriarchate said three projectiles fired by an Israeli tank had also struck a convent, destroying its generator and fuel supplies, and rendering a building housing 54 disabled people uninhabitable.
“The 54 disabled persons are currently displaced and without access to the respirators that some of them need to survive,” it added.
According to the Vatican press agency, the strikes wounded three people.
Italy’s top diplomat, Antonio Tajani, issued a “heartfelt appeal to the Israeli government and army to protect Christian places of worship”.
“That is not where the Hamas terrorists are hiding,” he said on X, formerly Twitter.
The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which killed around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to official figures.
Israel’s campaign to crush the militant group has so far killed at least 18,800, mostly women and children, according to the territory’s Hamas government.

Several European foreign ministers urge ceasefire but Netanyahu is ‘committed as ever’ to war,"LAST UPDATE|17 Dec 2023
ISRAEL IS COMING under further pressure to scale back its combat operations in Gaza, amid growing anger about conduct by its army in the region.
Foreign ministers for Germany, France and the UK have urged a ceasefire, but Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has told a nationwide address that he is “committed as ever” to the war.
UK foreign secretary David Cameron, writing in a joint Sunday Times article with the German Foreign Affairs minister Annalena Baerbock, called for a “sustainable” ceasefire in the conflict, as he warned that “too many civilians have been killed” by Israel.
The two senior politicians say that neither the UK nor Germany is calling for an immediate ceasefire, but the call for a “sustainable” ceasing of conflict is a significant shift in language by the UK Government.
They wrote: “Our goal cannot simply be an end to fighting today. It must be peace lasting for days, years, generations. We therefore support a ceasefire, but only if it is sustainable.
“We know many in the region and beyond have been calling for an immediate ceasefire. We recognise what motivates these heartfelt calls.
“It is an understandable reaction to such intense suffering, and we share the view that this conflict cannot drag on and on.”
Elsewhere, their French counterpart Catherine Colonna today pressed for an “immediate and durable” truce in the Gaza war, saying “too many civilians are being killed” in the Palestinian territory.
However, the UK government’s deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden carried a different message to Cameron’s call, when he told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that in order for a ceasefire to be sustainable, “we have to ensure we remove the threat of Hamas from Israel, and indeed the wider Middle East”.
He added: “So, that’s why we continue to support Israel in its right to self-defence, to remove the threat of Hamas, and at the same time to get those hostages back. Those are the two things that ensure we have a sustainable ceasefire.”
Israel has pressed ahead with its Gaza offensive today after a series of shootings, including of three hostages who were shirtless and waving a white flag, raised questions about its conduct in the 10-week-old war that has brought unprecedented death and destruction to the coastal enclave.
Gaza remained under a communications blackout for a fourth straight day – the longest of several outages over the course of the war, which aid groups say complicate rescue efforts after bombings and make it even more difficult to monitor the war’s toll on civilians.
In his nationwide address last night to Israeli citizens, Netanyahu said the killing of the hostages by his own army “broke my heart, broke the entire nation’s heart,” but he indicated no change in Israel’s military campaign.

“We are as committed as ever to continue until the end, until we dismantle Hamas, until we return all our hostages,” Netanyahu said last night.
Anger over the mistaken killings is likely to increase pressure on the Israeli government to renew Qatar-mediated negotiations with Hamas over swapping more of the remaining captives, which Israel says number 129, for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.
A senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, reiterated that there will be no further hostage releases until the war ends and Israel accepts the militant group’s conditions for an exchange.
Netanyahu said Israel would never agree to such demands.
Israel’s account of how the three hostages – Alon Shamriz, Samer Al-Talalka and Yotam Haim – were killed also raised questions about its soldiers’ conduct. Palestinians on several occasions have said Israeli soldiers opened fire as civilians tried to flee to safety. Hamas has claimed other hostages were previously killed by Israeli fire or air strikes, without presenting evidence.

An Israeli military official said the hostages had likely been abandoned by their captors or had escaped. The soldiers’ behaviour was “against our rules of engagement”, the official said, and was being investigated at the highest level.
The hostages did everything they could to signal they were not a threat, “but this shooting was done during fighting and under pressure,” Herzi Halevi, chief of the military’s general staff said.
Mr Halevi added: “There may be additional incidents in which hostages will escape or will be abandoned during the fighting. We have the obligation and the responsibility to get them out alive.”
The hostages, all in their 20s, were killed on Friday in the Gaza City area of Shijaiyah, where troops are engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas. They had been among more than 240 people taken hostage during an unprecedented raid by Hamas into Israel on October 7 in which around 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians.
Speaking at a rally in Tel Aviv, Rubi Chen, father of 19-year-old hostage Itay Chen, criticised the government for believing hostages can be retrieved through military pressure. “Put the the best offer on the table to get the hostages home alive,” he said. “We don’t want them back in bags.”
The Israeli military official said the three hostages had emerged from a building close to Israeli soldiers’ positions. They waved a white flag and were shirtless, possibly trying to signal they posed no threat.
Two were killed immediately, and the third ran back into the building screaming for help in Hebrew. The commander issued an order to cease fire, but another burst of gunfire killed the third man, the official said.
Israeli media gave a more detailed account. Daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot said that according to an investigation into the incident, soldiers followed the third man and shouted at him to come out, and at least one soldier shot him when he emerged from a staircase.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said the soldiers who followed the third hostage believed he was a Hamas member. Local media reported that soldiers earlier saw a nearby building marked “SOS” and “Help! Three hostages” but feared it might be a trap.

Dahlia Scheindlin, an political analyst, said it was unlikely the killings would massively alter public support for the war. Most Israelis still have a strong sense of why it is being fought and believe Hamas needs to be defeated, she said.
“They feel like there’s no other choice,” she said.
The killings emphasised the dangers hostages face in areas of house-to-house combat like Shijaiyah, where nine soldiers were killed this week in one of the war’s deadliest days for Israeli ground forces. The military has said Hamas has booby-trapped buildings and ambushed troops from a tunnel network it built under Gaza City.
On Saturday, the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum asserted that another hostage, 27-year-old Inbar Hayman, had been killed in Gaza. The group gave no details.
Hamas released over 100 hostages for Palestinian prisoners during a brief ceasefire in November. Nearly all freed on both sides were women and minors. Talks on further swaps broke down.
Hamas seeks the return of all Palestinian prisoners. As of late November, Israel held nearly 7,000 Palestinians accused or convicted of security offences, including hundreds rounded up since the war began.
The war has flattened much of northern Gaza and driven 85% of the territory’s population of 2.3 million from their homes. Only a trickle of aid has been able to enter Gaza. Israel has said it would open a second entry point at Kerem Shalom to speed up deliveries.
The offensive has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Thursday. It does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.
It was the ministry’s last update before the latest communications blackout in Gaza. “Now 48 hours and counting. The incident is likely to limit reporting and visibility to events on the ground,” said Alp Toker, director of NetBlocks, a group tracking internet outages.
The war has been deadly for journalists. Mourners held funeral prayers for Samer Abu Daqqa, a Palestinian journalist working for broadcaster Al Jazeera who was killed on Friday in an Israeli strike. The Committee to Protect Journalists said the cameraman was the 64th journalist to be killed in the conflict: 57 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese.
The United States, Israel’s closest ally, has expressed unease over Israel’s failure to reduce civilian casualties, but the White House continues to offer support with weapons shipments and diplomatic backing.
Israel and the US remain far apart on who should run Gaza after the war. Washington wants to see a unified Palestinian government in Gaza and the West Bank as a precursor to eventual Palestinian statehood. A two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict enjoys broad international support.
Netanyahu reiterated yesterday that Israel will retain security in a demilitarized Gaza and that a Palestinian state would pose a threat to Israel. “I am proud to have prevented the establishment of a Palestinian state,” he said.
US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin is travelling to Israel to continue discussions on a timetable for winding down the war’s intense combat phase. But Netanyahu and military leaders vowed to continue until “complete victory”, which the prime minister noted will take time.","7.39am, 17 Dec 2023",,
'There is no safe haven': Over 60 journalists killed since start of Israel-Hamas conflict,"MORE THAN SIXTY journalists have been killed since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began in October, in what is becoming one of the deadliest-ever conflicts for reporters.
Tallies counted by NGOs including the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) state that dozens of media workers have been killed since the conflict began more than two months ago.
The vast majority of those killed so far are reported to be Palestinian (56), though four Israelis and three Lebanese journalists are also among the dead.  Several others are reported to have been seriously injured or missing.
Another count by media rights group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) last week said 58 journalists had been killed in Gaza by Israeli strikes, 14 of them in the line of duty.
Almost 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date, including 18,400 Gazans during Israel’s offensive into the Palestinian enclave – the majority of them civilians – and 1,200 people during the initial attack by Hamas on 7 October.
“International journalists are banned from entering Gaza. Reporters there have no safe refuge and no way of leaving. They are being killed one after another,” Jonathan Dagher Head of RSF’s Middle East desk, has said.
“Since 7 October, the Palestinian territory has been subjected to a veritable eradication of journalism.”
The toll of journalists exceeds the number of reporters killed during the first 20 days of the war in Iraq in 2003, and those killed in Afghanistan in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 in 2001, according to RSF.
To date in the 21st century, long-running wars in Iraq and Syria have seen the highest number of fatalities for journalists overall –with 300 and 282 deaths reported respectively.
Last week, RSF urged Israeli and Egyptian authorities to allow journalists to move freely across the Gaza Strip’s southern border crossing into Egypt.
The crossing at Rafah closed after Israel began its war on Hamas and although it has opened in recent weeks, only those whose names were on approved lists have been allowed to leave the Palestinian territory.
RSF also fileda complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in November over alleged war crimes committed against journalists since the start of the conflict.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), this week called for the work of journalists during a times of crisis to be recognised and said media workers should not be targeted by parties involved in conflict.
“Journalists across the region are making great sacrifices to cover this heart-breaking conflict,” said Sherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa programme coordinator.
“Those in Gaza, in particular, have paid, and continue to pay, an unprecedented toll and face exponential threats. Many have lost colleagues, families, and media facilities, and have fled seeking safety when there is no safe haven or exit.”
The CPJ and IFJ have compiled lists of the journalists who have been killed to date, according to their own tallies. They also list the dates on which they were killed. Below are the names of journalists that appear on both lists.

"Three hostages killed by Israeli troops were 'shirtless and carrying white cloth', IDF confirms","LAST UPDATE|16 Dec 2023

THE THREE HOSTAGES killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza were shot even as they carried a “white cloth” and cried for help in Hebrew, an Israeli army official has confirmed.
Israel has been mourning the deaths of Yotam Haim, Alon Shamriz and Samer El-Talalqa, who were killed in a neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday when troops mistook them for a threat, the army said.
Bringing back captives taken by Hamas militants on October 7 has been a key reason cited by the army for its assault on Gaza.
The killing of the three hostages, all in their twenties, sparked protests in Tel Aviv.
An army official detailed the findings of an ongoing preliminary investigation into their deaths in a virtual briefing to journalists.
The three “emerged tens of metres from one of our forces’ positions”, he said. “They’re all without shirts and they have a stick with a white cloth on it,” he said, asking not to be named.
‘Terrorists’
A soldier sees them and “feels threatened and opens fire”, the official said.
“He declares that they’re terrorists. They (soldiers) open fire. Two are killed immediately, one is injured and runs back into the building.”
The official said the soldiers heard “a cry for help… in Hebrew”.
“Immediately, the battalion commander issues a ceasefire order. But again, there’s another burst of fire towards the third figure and he also dies,” the official said.
He added that it was possible the hostages “were abandoned or escaped”.
He also said that several hundred metres (yards) away, “there was a building with markings of SOS on it,” and the army was investigating whether there was a connection between the building and the hostages.
The army official said the killings were “against our rules of engagement”.
He called it a “tragic” event and a “very hard day”, but said there was “intense combat in the area” and that troops had been under “intense pressure”.
“The terrorists, they are moving around in civilian attire. They’re wearing sneakers and jeans. And there’s a lot of ambushes there.”

He said fighters had been “trying to pull us in to traps” with deceptive tactics.
“The rules of engagement are being sent out again to all the forces,” he said.
The three hostages were among about 240 people taken during Hamas’s October 7 attacks in Israel, which killed around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
As news of the incident spread late last night, hundreds of people gathered at Israel’s ministry of defence in Tel Aviv to call on Netanyahu’s government to secure the release of 129 hostages still being held in Hamas-ruled territory.

Vowing to destroy Hamas and bring back the hostages, Israel launched a massive military offensive against the Palestinian Islamist movement that has left much of the Gaza Strip in ruins.
The territory’s Hamas government says the war has killed at least 18,800 people, mostly women and children.
“During combat in Shejaiya, the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) mistakenly identified three Israeli hostages as a threat and as a result, fired toward them and the hostages were killed,” Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said.
“The IDF expresses deep sorrow regarding this disaster and shares in the grief of the families.”
Their bodies were transferred to Israel, and on examination were confirmed as being Haim, a 28-year-old heavy metal drummer, 25-year-old Bedouin man El-Talalqa and Shamriz, aged 26.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described their deaths as an “unbearable tragedy”.
Protest
At last night’s demonstration, protesters waved Israeli flags and brandished placards.
“Every day, a hostage dies,” read one message.
“I am dying of fear,” said Merav Svirsky, sister of Hamas-held hostage Itay Svirsky.
“We demand a deal now.”
In November, a short-lived truce saw more than 100 hostages freed in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
That deal has since lapsed and fighting has resumed.

But the hostages’ deaths have heightened already fierce scrutiny of how Israel is conducting its ground and air assault in Gaza.
In retaliation for the October attacks, Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and bring the hostages home.
However, his tactics have brought searing criticism from neighbouring Muslim states, and deep unease among allies in Europe, the United States and beyond.
Blackout concern
A prolonged communications blackout that severed telephone and internet connections compounded the misery today in the besieged Gaza Strip, where a United Nations agency said hunger levels had spiralled in recent days.
Internet and telephone lines went down on Thursday evening and were still inaccessible on Saturday morning, according to internet access advocacy group NetBlocks.org, hampering aid deliveries and rescue efforts as Israel’s war against Gaza’s ruling militant group Hamas stretched into the 11th week.
“The internet blackout is ongoing, and based on our records it is the longest such incident” in the over-two-month war, said Alp Toker, the group’s director.
The United Nations’ humanitarian affairs department said communications with Gaza were “severely disrupted” due to damage to telecommunications lines in the south.
White House talks
With Hamas authorities claiming the war has now killed 18,800 people, the White House, which provides billions of dollars in military aid to Israel, voiced growing concern over civilian casualties.
“I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives — not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful,” said US President Joe Biden.
Biden’s top security advisor Jake Sullivan was visiting Israel and the West Bank to drive that message home.
“We do not believe that it makes sense for Israel, or is right for Israel, to… reoccupy Gaza over the long term,” Sullivan said after meeting Israeli leaders.
News platform Axios reported that the director of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, David Barnea, was due to meet this weekend in an unspecified location in Europe with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.
Axios said the officials would discuss resuming negotiations for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages.

'Please bring him back': Wife of Irish citizen trapped in Gaza pleads for his safe return,"THE WIFE OF an Irish-Palestinian citizen stuck in Gaza has appealed to the Irish Government to help bring her husband home.
Batoul Hania and her four sons are among the Irish citizens who left Gaza via the Rafah Crossing last month and are now back in Ireland. However, her husband Zak and his nephew Mohammad are still there.
Several Irish citizens haveleft Gazain recent weeks but a small number remain in the region.
Speaking on RTÉ Radio 1′sSaturday with Barry Lenihan, Batoul said she is grateful she and her sons are safe, but she regrets leaving her husband.
“It was heartbreaking. It was not just saying goodbye, saying farewell to somebody. You are in extraordinary conditions, you are leaving somebody in danger.

“It is a matter of death and life, at any moment I can receive bad news about my husband, about my kids’ father.”
Batoul said Zak was “begging” her to “take the kids and go”, but she regrets leaving him, adding: “I feel guilty all the time.”
She called on the Irish Government to help get all Irish citizens out of Gaza.
“The mother does not abandon her children. Please, Irish Government, you are the mother of every Irish citizen in Gaza now. They are in danger,” she said.
A week after she returned to Ireland, Batoul met Tánaiste Micheál Martin. She today said he could not guarantee Zak’s return to Ireland but told her the Government would “do our best” to see this happen.
Zak moved to Ireland in 1998 and lived in Castleknock in Dublin, before returning to Gaza about a decade ago. The couple’s four sons were all born in Ireland.

‘Absolutely horrendous’
Speaking on the same programme, junior minister Thomas Byrne said the situation is “absolutely horrendous” for the Hanias and other families.
“The Irish Government, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, our diplomatic network all around the world are continuing to work consistently with every country in the region that has an influence on those cases… We’re trying to work to get them out.”
Hamas militants poured over the border into Israel on 7 October, killing around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures. Around 240 people were kidnapped in the attacks.
Vowing to destroy Hamas and bring back the hostages, Israel launched a massive military offensive that the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry says has killed at least 18,800 people, mostly women and children, to date.

Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd suspends routes through Red Sea after ships attacked,"LAST UPDATE|15 Dec 2023

GLOBAL SHIPPING FIRM Maersk has said it is suspending routes through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea until further notice, after one of its ships was attacked yesterday.
Yemen’s Huthi rebels struck a cargo ship in the Red Sea today, causing a fire on deck, amid near-daily attacks in the commercially vital waterway.
The rebels later claimed they fired missiles at two other ships in the Red Sea.
German transport company Hapag-Lloyd has also announced it is suspending Red Sea container ship traffic until 18 December after one of its vessels was attacked by rebels.
“Hapag-Lloyd is interrupting all container ship traffic across the Red Sea until Monday,” the company said in a statement sent to AFP.
At that point, they would make a decision on the subsequent period, it said.
The company said one of its vessels had been attacked off the coast of Yemen but there were no casualties.
The Iran-backed Huthis, who control much of Yemen but are not recognised internationally, say they’re targeting shipping to pressure Israel during its conflict with Hamas.
“While the Huthis are pulling the trigger, so to speak, they’re being handed the gun by Iran,” said US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.
This development comes as Israel today reopened an aid crossing into Gaza.
The conflict began after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October that Israeli officials say killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
Vowing to destroy Hamas and bring home an estimated 250 hostages taken by militants into Gaza, Israel launched a massive military offensive that has left much of the besieged territory in ruins.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
The Gaza health ministry says the conflict has killed more than 18,700 people, mostly women and children.
Fierce fighting continued today, with Hamas claiming they had blown up a house containing Israeli soldiers in the city of Khan Yunis.
Further south in Rafah near the Egyptian border, crowds of Palestinians used flashlights to search the rubble of buildings for survivors following Israeli strikes.
“This is a residential neighbourhood, women and children live here, as you can see,” said resident Abu Omar. “Three missiles on a residential neighbourhood that has nothing to do with any militant activities.”
Multiple rockets were intercepted over Jerusalem by its powerful missile-defence system.
Under pressure to do more to spare civilians, Israel announced it would allow the “temporary” entry of aid into Gaza through a second crossing, at Kerem Shalom near Rafah, the only other point of entry for humanitarian supplies.
The Israeli army said today that 119 troops had died in Gaza since the start of the ground offensive.

It said the body of a French-Israeli hostage kidnapped on 7 October, Elia Toledano, was recovered and returned to Israel.
“We are working together with security agencies, and with all intelligence and operational means in order to return all of the hostages home,” the army said.
The United States, which provides billions of dollars in military aid to Israel, has strongly backed its response to Hamas’s attacks, but has voiced increasing concern over civilian casualties and the long-term plan for Gaza.
“We do not believe that it makes sense for Israel, or is right for Israel, to … reoccupy Gaza over the long term,” US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv.
Gallant warned that Israel’s fight with Hamas “will last more than several months, but we will win and we will destroy them”.

In Washington, US President Joe Biden reiterated calls for greater care for Gazan civilians.
“I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives – not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful,” said Biden.
Sullivan also travelled to the West Bank to meet Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, who said Gaza must remain an “integral part” of the Palestinian state.
Abbas’s Palestinian Authority runs the Israeli-occupied West Bank, but is deeply unpopular with Palestinians and has been further weakened by the conflict.
More than 280 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since the conflict began.
Multiple Western nations, including Australia, Britain, Canada, France and the European Union, demanded today that Israel “take concrete steps to halt unprecedented violence by Israeli settlers”.
Meanwhile, a journalist for Turkish agency Anadolu was severely assaulted by Israeli police while trying to take photos of Palestinians praying in East Jerusalem.
A police spokesperson said the officers were suspended.
This week, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly supported a non-binding resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza, with Washington voting against it.
The UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been displaced.
Its humanitarian agency OCHA says more than a third of households have reported severe hunger, while more than 90% are “going to bed hungry”.
Adding to the desperation, mobile and internet communications were cut yesterday and yet to return the following day, with operator Paltel blaming “the cut off of main fibre routes from the Israeli side”.
Hamas’s media office described it as a “premeditated crime that deepens the humanitarian crisis” by making it harder for rescuers to reach injured people.
Aid distribution has largely stopped in most of Gaza, except on a limited basis in the Rafah area, according to the UN.
COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, said the military “is enabling tactical pauses for humanitarian purposes”.

EU Council ends without call for Gaza ceasefire as Taoiseach says bloc must 'insist on two-state solution',"LAST UPDATE|15 Dec 2023
AN EU COUNCIL summit has ended without a decision to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Ireland, Spain, Belgium and Malta had called on the EU Council to adopt a clear stance on demanding a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as Israel continues its assault.
However, a number of member states are not on board.
On Tuesday, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a non-binding resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.
Austria and the Czech Republic, both EU members, voted against the resolution. Eight member states abstained and 17 voted in favour.
Minister of State for European Affairs Peter Burke has said that ”while there was a huge groundswell of support within the room, there wasn’t unanimity”.
Speaking to RTÉ Radio One, Burke said: “There are a few countries that still haven’t come on board and that poses a huge challenge to the European Union.”
“Obviously, we’re a collection of democracies, we’re not a federal union, and that poses a challenge in terms of getting a text into the European Council conclusions.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar earlier called for the European Union to “insist on a two-state solution in the Middle East” and that Israel should be “pressurised” for its failure to “allow the Palestinians their own state”.
He was speaking to reporters in Brussels on the second day of the two-day European Council summit.
Among the issues raised at yesterday’s summit was a €50 billion euro aid package for Ukraine,which was vetoed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Today’s agenda included the “immediate security and humanitarian situation in Gaza”.
Ahead of the meetings, Varadkar called on the European Union to “become more active and more interested in this issue”.
“For a long time now, we’ve talked the talk when it comes to building a two-state solution in the Middle East, but we haven’t really put our political or economic power behind that and I think we should,” said Varadkar.

The Taoiseach said the EU should “insist on a two-state solution”.
He added: “We should work with the Palestinian Authority, or a new Palestinian leadership perhaps, to make that happen but also really pressurise Israel and say that their failure to allow the Palestinians to have their own state is going to affect the relationship between Israel and the EU into the future.”
Further speaking on the situation in the Middle East, Varadkar said: “It’s not going to be back to the way it was before this war.”
Meanwhile, Varadkar again called for a ceasefire, and remarked that “the majority of EU countries are now calling for a ceasefire”.
He said this was “very clear from the UN vote the other day”.
Varadkar said Austria and the Czech Republic voted against the UN resolution “because they believe that it would prevent Israel from pursuing Hamas terrorists”.
“I don’t agree with that interpretation,” Varadkar told reporters this morning in Brussels.
“You can pursue terrorists without engaging in the kind of war and destruction that Israel is engaging in at the moment in Gaza,” he added.
“We know that from European countries who have also had to deal with terrorism, they didn’t do or even contemplate doing what Israel has done in Gaza.”
Varadkar added: “We now have a clear majority of countries here in the European Union calling for a ceasefire.
“I think that’s the view of the people of Europe as well, which is important.”
He also called for “strong language on human rights”, particularly in relation to the West Bank.
The Palestinian Health Ministry yesterday said that Israeli forces had killed 11 people in a multi-day raid in the occupied West Bank.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and in recent months troops have carried out repeated deadly raids on Jenin, with the casualties including militants and children.
Varadkar said there is “no possible justification or excuse for what’s happening there” and added that “hundreds of Palestinians have been killed by violent Israeli settlers in an area that is not controlled by Hamas”.

Israeli army recovers the body of French-Israeli hostage,"
THE ISRAELI ARMY has said it recovered and returned the body of French-Israeli hostage Elya Toledano, who was kidnapped and taken to Gaza by militants during Hamas’s 7 October attacks.
Toledano, 28, was among an estimated 240 people taken hostage during the Hamas attacks on Israel, which were the deadliest in the country’s history.
He was attending a desert rave party named the Tribe of Nova festival along with friend and fellow French-Israeli Mia Shem, who was released under a truce agreement at the end of November.
Scores of mainly Israeli hostages but also foreign nationals were released during the short-lived truce, while several have been confirmed killed in the war that began with the attacks.
Israeli officials say the 7 October attacks killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, Israel’s ensuing offensive has killed more than 18,700 people, mostly women and children.

“During an operation in Gaza, the body of the hostage Elya Toledano (28) was recovered by IDF Special Forces and brought back to Israel,” the Israeli army said in a statement, adding that forensic experts had identified the remains.
“The IDF sends the family its heartfelt condolences,” it said, adding that Toledano’s family had been notified prior to the public statement.
The families of hostages had said in recent weeks that they did not know whether Toledano was still alive.
French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said her country was “deeply saddened to hear the Israeli armed forces announce the death of our compatriot Elya Toledano, a Hamas hostage whose body was found in Gaza”.
“We share the grief of his family and loved ones. The release of all hostages is our priority,” she wrote on X.
According to the Israeli military, 135 of the hostages taken to Gaza are still being held.
Families of the hostages said this week that they were “shocked” by the director of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad’s announcement that he was refusing to conduct new negotiations to free them, and demanded an explanation from the authorities.","8.33am, 15 Dec 2023",,
RTÉ receives close to 500 emails calling on it to boycott Eurovision due to Israel’s involvement,"CLOSE TO 500 emails have been sent to RTÉ calling on it to boycott the 2024 Eurovision due to Israel’s involvement in the song contest.
RTÉ is Ireland’s representative broadcaster at the Eurovision Song Contest and it has been urged in these emails to “immediately withdraw support and participation in the contest next year, if Israel is permitted to compete”.
Israel was expected, as usual, to take part in the contest – but the campaign to launch an Irish boycott gathered paceafter official confirmation last week of the 37 countries to take part in next year’s contest in the Swedish city of Malmo.
Meanwhile in Iceland, a songwriter’s group has also called for a boycott.
The Icelandic Society of Authors and Composers has urgedIceland’s national broadcaster RÚV to withdraw from the Song Contestunless Israel is banned from participating.
In a statement toThe Journal, an RTÉ spokesperson said the state broadcaster “is aware of this petition” and has “received approximately 465 emails in relation to it” as of yesterday.
A template email, that has been seen byThe Journal, claims that “Israel’s participation in the contest next year brings the entire competition into disrepute”.
The petition adds that by “competing alongside Israel, we are supporting the atrocities currently being carried out by Israel in Palestine”.
The email added: “It appears that Israel’s participation is part of a concerted public relations effort by the Israeli government to portray itself to the global community as a modern, liberal, forward-thinking state, despite the years of occupation and violence against Palestine.”
The email also notes that while a “boycott of the competition will not end the brutal violence, it will serve as a symbol of solidarity with the Palestinian people”.
The petition further describes Ireland as a “vital part of the heartbeat and history of the competition” and added that it is “essential that we use our voice now to condemn the actions of the Israeli government”.
It also noted that Russia was excluded from the competition due to the invasion of Ukraine after the Eurovision organisers said thatto do otherwise would “bring the competition into disrepute”.
The Eurovision Song Contest is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
In the immediate aftermath of the 2022 Ukraine invasion, the EBU said it was “monitoring the situation” and that Russia remained in that year’s competition.
That decision was reversed within 24 hours however.
As EBU boss and former RTÉ director general Noel Curran explained in an interviewwithThe Journalat that year’s song contest, “it was pretty clear to us that we wouldn’t be able to have Russia take part”.
The template email being sent to RTÉ as part of the current boycott campaign said this decision “sent a powerful message of solidarity to the citizens of Ukraine and showed the world that Eurovision stands for unity and peace”.
“The people of Palestine deserve to hear that message”, the email added.

The war, now in its third month, began after the unprecedented 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israel.
Israeli officials say the attacks killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
Israel then began a relentless bombardment and ground invasion that has killed close to 19,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza.

A spokesperson for RTÉ toldThe Journal: “RTÉ has always approached the event in the spirit in which it was founded – which is a non-political contest designed to unite audiences and bring people together through a shared love of music and entertainment.
“37 nations, including Ireland, will take part in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest.
“RTÉ is not aware of any participating Public Service Broadcaster who is planning to boycott the upcoming Eurovision Song Contest.”
The EBU – which is, essentially, an alliance of public service media organisations whose countries are within the European Broadcasting Area – said in a statement toThe Journalthat the Song Contest was a “competition for public service broadcasters from across Europe and the Middle East”.
“It is a competition for broadcasters – not governments – and the Israeli public broadcaster has participated in the Contest for 50 years,” said the EBU spokesperson.
“We are a member-led organisation. The governing bodies of the European Broadcasting Union represent the membership.
“These bodies have reviewed the participants list and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN meets all the competition rules and can participate in the Contest next year in Malmö, Sweden, alongside 36 other broadcasters.”
The spokesperson added that the “EBU is aligned with other international organisations that have similarly maintained their inclusive stance towards Israeli participants in major competitions at this time”.
In 2019, the Eurovision was held in the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv.
Singer and Senator Frances Black was among over 3,000 people in Ireland – including artists and media personalities -to support a boycott of that year’s Eurovision due to it taking place in Israel.
Ireland took part in the 2019 contest in spite of the boycott campaign -a move welcomed by the Israeli ambassador at the time who accused organisers of attempting to “hijack” the event for political reasons.
In a statement toThe Journal, Black said she “absolutely supports an Irish boycott of Eurovision 2024”.
She said that the EBU last year took “a clear, decisive and morally correct stand by banning Russia from participating while it was invading Ukraine”.
Russia remains suspended from the Eurovision Song Contest following its invasion of Ukraine.
Ahead of the 2024 contest, Black said “the EBU must exclude Israel because of its genocidal bombardment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza”.
She also criticised Azerbaijan’s involvement in the Eurovision “because it has ethnically cleansed the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh”.
Internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh became a breakaway state under the control of ethnic Armenian forces in 1994 following a six-year conflict and has remained a point of tension ever since.
In October, theEuropean Parliament passed a resolution which said it considered that the situation in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region amounted to ethnic cleansingand strongly condemned the “threats and violence committed by Azerbaijani troops” against Armenian residents.
Black added: “If the EBU fails to take these actions it will demonstrate that European cultural institutions take a selective and hypocritical approach to human rights and international law, which brings them into disrepute.
“RTÉ should boycott Eurovision 2024 if it means participating alongside Israel and Azerbaijan and allowing those regimes to use the event to whitewash their crimes against defenceless civilians.”
Around 200 people took part in pro-Palestine protests at this year’s Eurovision held in Liverpool in May,where Israel’s Noa Kirol placed third in the contest behind Sweden and Finland.
Ireland exited the contest during the weekday semi-final stages.

"The EU has lost credibility because of Gaza, Taoiseach says","TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR will tell European Union leaders today that it is his view that the EU has “lost credibility” because of its “inability to take a stronger and more united position on Israel and Palestine”.
Speaking ahead of the summit in Brussels, the Taoiseach said he thinks the position of EU countries has been evolving, but said it needs to go further.
“The center of gravity within the European Union is moving closer to the position that Ireland has just taken for some time, but still needs to move further in my view,” he told reporters.
He said he will be telling leaders today that his view is that the EU has lost credibility because of its position to date.
“We’ve lost credibility with the Global South, which actually is most of the world, because of what is perceived to be double standards. And there’s some truth in that, quite frankly,” he said.

The Taoiseach added that the EU also has a credibility issue amoung younger voters.
“We know how strong young people feel about climate. They also feel really strongly about the issue of Israel and Palestine,” he said.
He said the majority of voters under 40 in the US and the EU now have “more sympathy with Palestinians than with Israelis”.
“That’s a significant change, and European leaders need to be wise to that,” he said.
“That’s why I think we need to have strong wording that condemns terrorism perpetrated by Hamas, but also calls for a humanitarian ceasefire, and calls for justice for Palestinian people – which is a two-state solution.”
Earlier this week, Ireland jointly signed a letter alongside Spain, Belgium and Malta urging EU leaders to call for anurgent humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.

"Senior US official visits Israel to discuss 'timetables', as nine soldiers killed in ambush","US PRESIDENT JOE Biden’s national security advisor will visit Israel today to hold discussions with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet “about timetables” for the operation, as a sign of the US pressure on Israel.
Its leaders intend to press ahead with the Gaza Strip war against Hamas, despite coming under increasing international pressure, including from key ally the United States.
Biden national security official Jake Sullivan told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that there may be a shift from the “high intensity military operations of the kind we have seen over the past weeks”.
His visit comes in the wake of Palestinian militants carrying out one of the deadliest single attacks on Israeli soldiers since the Gaza invasion began, killing at least nine in an urban ambush. The Israeli military confirmed the attack.
It’s s a sign of the stiff resistance Hamas still poses despite more than two months of devastating bombardment.
The ambush in a dense neighbourhood comes after repeated recent claims by the Israeli military that it had broken Hamas’s command structure in northern Gaza, encircled remaining pockets of fighters, killed thousands of militants and detained hundreds more.

The tenacious fighting underscores how far Israel appears to be from its aim of destroying Hamas — even after the military unleashed one of the 21st century’s most destructive onslaughts.
For Sullivan, he has said there is “disagreement” between Israel and Washington over how a post-conflict Gaza would be governed.
Speaking yesterday, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said any plan for post-war Gaza that does not involve the Palestinian militant group “or the resistance factions is a delusion”.
He said Hamas was ready for talks that could lead to a “political path that secures the right of the Palestinian people to their independent state with Jerusalem as its capital”.
Washington and London announced further sanctions yesterday against Hamas, targeting “key officials who perpetuate Hamas’s violent agenda”.

Military objectives
Biden said on Tuesday that he told Netanyahu that Israel is losing international support because of its “indiscriminate bombing”.
“Israel doesn’t seem to be anywhere near achieving its military objective,” Mairav Zonszein, a senior Israel analyst with the International Crisis Group, wrote on X, pointing to Tuesday’s deadly ambush.
“With Biden already signalling loss of patience, with no signs of a hostage release and Israel’s economy overstretched, and with a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions in Gaza, Israel could find itself in a much worse position the day after, with a lot of losses and no win,” she wrote.
Israel doesn't seem to be anywhere near achieving its military objective, and with every day that passes, the hostage number goes down as more dead bodies are discovered. How much longer does it think it can go like this? /3— Mairav Zonszein מרב זונשיין (@MairavZ)December 13, 2023

Biden urged Netanyahu to change his government, which is dominated by hard-right parties.
But the offensive is being conducted by a war Cabinet that includes two politically centrist retired generals, and it has overwhelming support among Israelis from across the political spectrum.
In Israel, attention is still focused on the atrocities carried out on October 7, when some 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and some 240 people were taken hostage, around half of whom remain in captivity.
The military says 115 soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive.
There has been little media coverage or public discussion of the plight of civilians in Gaza, even as international outrage has mounted.
‘Unparalleled’ damage
The war, now in its third month, was launched after the unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas that Israeli officials say killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
It has left Gaza in ruins, killing more than 18,600 people, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and causing “unparalleled” damage to roads, schools and hospitals.
The day after the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly backed a non-binding resolution for a ceasefire, more strikes hit Gaza and battles raged, especially in Gaza City, the biggest urban centre, and Khan Yunis and Rafah in the south, AFP correspondents said.
Wintery rain lashed the territory, where the UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million population have been displaced, living in makeshift tents as supplies of food, drinking water, medicines and fuel run low.

Israel says it will press on with Gaza offensive 'with or without international support',"
ISRAEL HAS DECLARED its determination to press on with its assault on Gaza “with or without international support”, after it came under mounting pressure even from key backer the United States.
The conflict was launched after the unprecedented 7 October attacks on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas that officials say killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
It has left Gaza in ruins, killing more than 18,600 people, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry, and causing “unparallelled” damage to roads, schools and hospitals.

Cold wintery rains lashed the territory, where the UN estimates 1.9 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million population have been displaced, living in makeshift tents as vital supplies of food, drinking water, medicines and fuel run low.
The United Nations warned the spread of diseases – including meningitis, jaundice, impetigo, chickenpox and upper respiratory tract infections – had intensified.
The World Health Organization said 107 trucks carrying humanitarian aid had entered the besieged territory from Egypt, well below the daily average of 500 before 7 October.
Air raid sirens wailed in Sderot and other southern Israeli communities near Gaza as Palestinian militants fired rockets, most of which were intercepted.
Israel’s military said sirens sounded in Ashdod city north of Gaza and in the Lakhish area. Social media footage showed a large fragment of an intercepted rocket had hit a supermarket.
The army said an air strike had hit a militant cell in Gaza City’s Shejaiya district “that was en route to launch rockets toward Israel”.

In the 7 October attack – the deadliest in Israel’s 75-year history – Hamas also seized around 240 hostages.
Determined to destroy Hamas and bring the hostages home, Israel began a devastating aerial and ground offensive.
It has lost 115 soldiers, including 10 in northern Gaza yesterday, its deadliest day since the ground assault began on 27 October.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
The UN General Assembly passed a resolution yesterday demanding a ceasefire, backed by 153 of 193 nations – surpassing the 140 or so that have routinely condemned Russia for invading Ukraine.
While Washington voted against, the resolution was supported by allies Australia, Canada and New Zealand, who, in a rare joint statement, said they were “alarmed at the diminishing safe space for civilians in Gaza”.
US President Joe Bidentold a campaign eventIsrael had “most of the world supporting it” immediately after 7 October, but “they’re starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place”.
Biden, who toned down his comments later, today met with families of American hostages from those the militants seized.
Despite the criticism from its main ally, Israel vowed to pursue its war.
“Israel will continue the war against Hamas with or without international support,” said Foreign Minister Eli Cohen.
“A ceasefire at the current stage is a gift to the terrorist organisation Hamas, and will allow it to return and threaten the residents of Israel,” Cohen told a visiting diplomat, quoted by his ministry.

The Gaza health ministry said Israeli forces opened fire on wards of Kamal Adwan hospital in north Gaza, raising fears for the safety of 12 children in paediatric care.
The army has yet to comment, but Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals, schools, mosques and vast tunnel systems beneath them as military bases – claims the group has denied.

Taoiseach: 'Even the US is beginning to have second thoughts about what's unfolding in Gaza',"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he believes Israel is “making a huge mistake” in relation to Gaza and Palestine, and noted that even the United States is having “second thoughts” about what is unfolding.
Speaking in the Dáil today, the Taoiseach said he believes now is the time for sanctions to be taken in response to some of the activities of the Israeli state, particularly in the West Bank.
During Leaders’ Questions, the Taoiseach was asked by Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns if it is now the position of the Irish government that multilateral trade sanctions should be imposed on Israel by the European Union (EU).
In response, the Taoiseach said because trade is an exclusive competence of the EU, any decisions made in relation to sanctions can only be made on the basis of unanimity among all member states. This he said, means it is effectively not possible to impose sanctions on Israel at an EU level.
He said however that he does believe the time has come for sanctions.
“We do believe that the time has come for sanctions to be taken with regards to activities, particularly in the West Bank,” the Taoiseach said.
“The Tánaiste has been liaising with a number of other member states in regard to this. One thing we want to do, and work is being done on this is to impose restrictions and travel bans, particularly on Israeli settlers – those who are causing huge difficulty for the Palestinian population in the West Bank.”
Earlier this week, the Tánaiste Micheál Martin said “very specific sanctions” could be applied to settlers on the West Bank who are “undermining any possibility of a contiguous two-state solution to the Middle East”.

When asked if Ireland could take measures nationally, such as travel bans on individuals, Martin said “we can, and we’re certainlyvery open to that”.
US involvement
The Taoiseach also said today that the situation in Gaza is “intolerable”.
He noted that over 18,000 people have been killed so far, many of them children.
He said the death toll is “shocking” and said the “relentless bombings and killing of innocent civilians must end”.
The Taoiseach added that he thinks the situation in Gaza is also a “disaster for Israel”.
“This will not bring them security. It won’t bring them peace and they are very quickly losing support and sympathy all around the world,” he said.
“Even their closest ally, the United States, I believe, is beginning to have second thoughts about what they’re seeing unfolding in Gaza. And that is a strategic disaster for Israel. In my view, they’re making a huge mistake.
“It’s not just about the humanitarian suffering that’s being imposed on people in Palestine. What the Israeli government is doing is jeopardising the long-term and medium-term security of Israeli people.”

Irish-Palestinian doctor speaks of the dwindling services left in Gazan hospitals,"AN IRISH-PALESTINIAN DOCTOR has detailed the dwindling amount of support and services available in hospitals inside the bombarded Gaza Strip.
Dublin-born plastic surgeon Ahmed El-Mokhallati has said there is no longer a proper hospital set up in the territory and all hospitals in the north of Gaza have ceased all major operations.
He told Al Jazeera Newsthat in the European Hospital – the hospital in the Khan Yunis province where he currently is working – sometimes only three surgery staff members are on site, while the hospital is suffering from extreme overcrowding.
Fighting and heavy bombardment in Gazahas continued sinceall ceasefire negotiations reached a standstill, leading to Israelpulling their Mossad negotiators out of talksbefore they officially concluded.
Israel previously urged civilians to seek safety in the southern part of the territory, however the majority of the shelling and fighting is taking place in the south since battles began again after the ceasefire – leaving people with few places to go.
Since the majority have moved south, the European Hospital in the centre of the Khan Younis province has seen their 200-bed capacity hospital so overrun that its been extended to 1,000 beds, Dr El-Mokhallati told the programme.
“We’ve ended up with no good hospitals operation in Gaza at all,” Dr El-Mokhallati said. “We’re talking about the whole [population] of Gaza are with no hospital with specialities.”
Dr El-Mokhallati said the hospitals are without the equipment to conduct specialist surgeries, while thousands of people need more than one surgery to keep them alive.

“Everyday, in the morning, you come and you see who has arrived from the team. Whoever is coming from the middle of Gaza can’t reach here as Israeli tanks are blocking roads that are connecting the middle of Gaza to the south,” he said.
He added that those under attack in Khan Yunis, and further south near Rafah, are “scared” to come to work in fear they will not be able to return home to their families.
Brutal fighting continued on Monday in Khan Yunis, as Hamas militants claimed they blew up a house in the southern Gazan city where Israeli soldiers were searching for a tunnel shaft.
AFP correspondents reported night-time strikes and automatic weapons fire in Khan Yunis and bombings that shook several urban areas.
The last death toll from the Gaza health ministry was over 18,000 – mostly women and children. It said on Monday that 32 dead had arrived at Khan Yunis’s Nasser hospital alone in 24 hours.
Last month, Dónal Gorman, a representative of Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) Irelandspoke on the crisis medical situation withThe Journal.
He described it as “truly dire” and said there were “horrendous stories” reaching them, including doctors of having to conduct operations and even amputations without adequate anesthetic.
The latest bout of conflict began on 7 October after Hamas, an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers attacked Israel, killing 1,200 mostly civilians.
Israel’s retaliatory assault, well into its third month, has killed over 18,000 people, also mostly civilians, including thousands of children.
Hamas says it tallies these figures from hospital directors, and they are generally used by international news outlets despite an inability to independently verify them at this time.

Biden says Israel is ‘losing support’ over ‘indiscriminate bombing’ campaign,"PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN has warned that Israel is losing international support because of its “indiscriminate bombing” of Gaza.
The president spoke out with unusually strong language just hours before theUnited Nations demanded a humanitarian ceasefirein Israel’s war against Hamas in the region.
Biden said to donors during a fundraiser on Tuesday: “Israel’s security can rest on the United States, but right now it has more than the United States.
“It has the European Union, it has Europe, it has most of the world supporting them.
“They’re starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place.”
The president said he thought Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu understood, but he was not so sure about the Israeli war cabinet.
Before Biden’s comments, Benjamin Netanyahu said that he had received full backing  from the US ""for the ground incursion and blocking the international pressure to stop the war”.APAP
Israeli forces were carrying out punishing strikes across Gaza, crushing Palestinians in their homes as the military presses ahead with an offensive that officials say could go on for weeks or months.
The president offered a harder-than-usual assessment of Israel’s decisions since the October 7 attack by Hamas and the moves by his conservative government.
Biden’s top national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will head to Israel this week to consult directly.
The US leader also renewed his warnings that Israel should not make the same mistakes of overreaction that the US did following the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks.
Biden recounted a well-worn story about him inscribing on a photo with Netanyahu decades ago, “Bibi, I don’t agree with a damn thing you have to say”.
This time, the president added to his retelling of the story: “That remains to be the case.”
The fundraiser was part of a gathering of Jewish donors, many of whom attended a White House Hanukkah reception on Monday evening.
Biden said that when he warned Netanyahu of a loss of international support over the bombing, the Israeli leader mentioned that the US had “carpet-bombed Germany” in World War II and dropped the atomic bomb on Japan.
“That’s why all these institutions were set up after World War II, to see that it didn’t happen again,” he said.
“Don’t make the same mistakes we made in 9/11. There’s no reason we had to be in a war in Afghanistan. There’s no reason we had to do so many things that we did.”

The UN General Assembly voted on Tuesday overwhelmingly in favour of a non-binding resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
The vote comes days after the US vetoed a similar measure at the UN Security Council.
The UK abstained from the 13-1 vote but France and Japan were among those supporting the call for a ceasefire.
Only Security Council resolutions are legally binding under the terms of the international body’s charter.
Before Biden’s comments at the fundraiser, Netanyahu said in a statement that he appreciated American support and that he had received “full backing for the ground incursion and blocking the international pressure to stop the war”.
“Yes, there is disagreement about ‘the day after Hamas’ and I hope that we will reach an agreement here as well.
“I would like to clarify my position: I will not allow Israel to repeat the mistake of Oslo. Gaza will be neither Hamastan nor Fatahstan.”
Biden specifically called out Itamar Ben-Gvir, the leader of a far-right Israeli party and the minister of national security in Netanyahu’s governing coalition, who opposes a two-state solution and has called for Israel to reassert control over all of the West Bank and Gaza.
Ben-Gvir sits on Israel’s security cabinet but is not a member of the country’s three-person war cabinet.
Earlier yesterday, Sullivan said he would speak with Netanyahu about timetables for ending major combat in Gaza, and that he would be carrying Biden’s thoughts on the matter.
He said he would also be looking to hear from Netanyahu and Israeli officials on the issue.
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will travel to Israel for talks this week.APAP
“The subject of how they are seeing the timetable of this war will certainly be on the agenda for my meetings,” Sullivan said during an appearance at a forum hosted by the Wall Street Journal.
The national security adviser suggested that at some point there would be a shift from the high-intensity Israeli operations seen over the last several weeks to more focused operations to achieve Israeli objectives.
He also said he would also speak to Netanyahu about his recent comments that Israel Defence Forces would maintain open-ended security control of Gaza after the war ends.
Sullivan reiterated the Biden administration’s position that it does not want to see Israel reoccupy Gaza or further shrink its already small territory.
The US has repeatedly called for a return of the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority and the resumption of peace talks aimed at establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
“I will have the opportunity to talk to Prime Minister Netanyahu about what exactly he has in mind with that comment because that can be interpreted in a number of different ways,” Sullivan said. “But the US position on this is clear.”","7.24am, 13 Dec 2023",,

 Gaza has become hell on earth, while the world just watches","LAST UPDATE|12 Dec 2023
THE ISRAELI DEFENCE Forces (IDF) have been engaged in ground operations within the Gaza Strip for 46 days now – since they commenced their invasion on 27 October. In that time, the Palestinian health authorities state that over 18,000 men, women and children have been killed with over 50,000 civilians seriously injured.
Among the dead are over 300 doctors, nurses, paramedics and other medical personnel. Almost 70 journalists and media workers have been killed. Of Gaza’s 2.2 million inhabitants, over 1.9 million – 85% of the population – have been internally displaced. In this situation, contrary to the Geneva Conventions and the laws of armed conflict, the IDF has not provided a safe evacuation corridor or a ‘Safe Zone’ for Palestinian civilians.
Lining up the dead in Gaza.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
As a consequence, over two million innocent Palestinians are kettled, or concentrated in a ‘free fire’ or what the IDF refer to as a ‘Fire Belt’ inside the Gaza Strip. This makes the current conflict one of the most deadly – for civilians – in recent history.
The military casualties are – relatively speaking – minor. After six weeks of intensive combat, the IDF claims to have killed 5,000 Hamas terrorists. This is out of a total of 30,000 Hamas fighters spread across the territory. Tactically, the IDF claims it has ‘broken’ Hamas in the north and in Gaza City.
IDF troops have reached the centre of Khan Younis where Israeli tanks and armour are attacking public buildings and residential areas in force. Rafah is the subject of air strikes and shell and missile bombardment from Israeli Air Force F-35 multi-role combat aircraft and 155 mm artillery batteries respectively. In the last 24 hours,22 people, including seven children, have been killed in these attacks– in an area into which the IDF previously directed Palestinian civilians, declaring it a place of safety.
The IDF has reported that during these operations they have lost105 troops killedin action – 20% of whom were killed in ‘friendly fire’ incidents. A further 582 are reported wounded. The principal victims in this war however have been innocent Palestinian civilians – including over 10,000 children.

At least 22 people reportedly killed, including seven children, in the bombing by Israel in Rafah on Tuesday.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
The Israeli Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant has estimated that it will take another two months – possibly longer – to conclude its operations in Gaza with the stated aim of ‘completely destroying’ Hamas. Based on the attrition rate so far, this means that at least another 20,000 Palestinian civilians – including 150 children per day – will be brutally slaughtered in the coming weeks.
Politically, this will not signal the end of the conflict. Israel’s National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi has warned that another war will likely begin against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Having avoided a war on two fronts thus far, Hanegbi has hinted that once Hamas has been ‘neutralised’ in the western Negev and approaches to Gaza, Israel will turn its attention to Galilee in the north.
Israel will be keen to avoid a situation where Hezbollah troops could pour across the border from Lebanon into northern Israel to carry out genocidal attacks on Israeli civilians – similar to the genocidal attacks by Hamas on 7 October.

Israel has been increasingly vocal in the last number of days aboutHezbollah’s breachof the UN Security Council Resolution – UNSC 1701 of 2006 – which prohibits the concentration of Hezbollah forces south of the Litani River. Hanegbi has alleged the presence of Hezbollah Radwan commando forces along the border with Israel. The Israeli military has begun making very vocal calls for ‘security assurances’ from Hezbollah’s leadership in this regard. This is a tense stand-off and an intensely busy period for Irish peacekeeping troops based in south Lebanon – deployed with UNIFIL at the heart of this potential second front.
In the immediate short term, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is set to deteriorate dramatically. The internally displaced population is now showing signs of hunger and the medical signs of thirst among children and babies. The UN and a raft of international aid agencies and NGOs – from UNWRA to Médecins Sans Frontières and Amnesty International, are warning of an ‘apocalyptic’ loss of life in Gaza through continued heavy fighting, starvation and disease.
Throughout this, Hamas continues to operate and fight – daily firing missiles indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel. Hamas is in clear and continuous breach of the Geneva Conventions and is committing grievous war crimes daily. They are threatening to murder the remaining 137 hostages they have taken, stating ‘The enemy and its leadership cannot take prisoners alive without an exchange’.
There is a pressing need for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. An attempt by the UN Security Council to pass a resolution to this effect – UNSC 377A – was defeated when the United States vetoed it and the UK abstained. Resolution UNGA 377A (V) has been invoked in the hope that the majority of the UN General Assembly might vote for an immediate ceasefire.

In the meantime, the Palestinian population in Gaza faces violence on an almost unimaginable scale. Persistent shelling from IDF 155mm artillery systems. Each 155mm shell contains a core of 10kg of high explosives surrounded by over 40kg of lethal metal shrapnel – with fuses designed to detonate on impact on civilian houses and public buildings.
Every day, thousands of such shells rain down on the Palestinian people. The blast and shrapnel effects of such munitions inflict catastrophic soft tissue injuries on any men, women or children within range – inflicting burns, limb separation, decapitation and injuries almost impossible to describe.

In addition to these artillery strikes, there are constant rolling air strikes – with massive 1000kg bombs – capable of destroying entire apartment blocks – burying dead and alive alike. Accompanying this is the renewed IDF ground assault. Massive Merkava main battle tanks firing 120mm cannons point blank into buildings – escorted by D-9 military bulldozers, crushing buildings and people alike as Israeli infantry dismount from Namer armoured personnel carriers and fight house to house, basement to basement and down into the tunnel network beneath.
Ireland’s Taoiseach and Tánaiste have given that leadership in their repeated calls for a ceasefire and adherence to the international laws of armed conflict.
This conflict fundamentally challenges the rules-based world order that we in the West, the EU and our neighbours in the UK and US purport to support. The manner in which this conflict is being waged – by both sides – is an affront to our shared values. If it is not stopped, it is a harbinger of greater violence to come – and not just in the Middle East.
The principal beneficiaries of this conflict are Netanyahu’s far-right government. It also benefits Vladimir Putin and his principal ally in the war on Ukraine, Iran. As the West depletes its strategic stockpile of weapons in support of this offensive – it will ultimately dilute its support of Ukraine and the territorial integrity of the EU. As the West depletes its moral authority in this way, it will also dilute its resolve and capacity to defend itself and the values that we purport to hold. What is happening in Gaza isnothing short of genocideand every right-thinking human being should call for an immediate ceasefire.

Overwhelming majority of countries at UN General Assembly backs demand for ceasefire in Gaza,"LAST UPDATE|12 Dec 2023
THE UN GENERAL Assembly has overwhelmingly passed a non-binding resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza – a call the paralysed Security Council has so far failed to make, piling pressure on Israel and Washington.
The body, which includes all 193 UN member nations, voted 153 in favor of the resolution, exceeding the 140 or so countries that have routinely backed resolutions condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Ten countries, including the United States and Israel, voted against, while 23 abstained.
The vote comes as Israeli forces continued to battle Hamas militants today and bombed more targets in the devastated Gaza Strip.
More than two months into the conflict sparked by Hamas’s 7 October attack, the visiting chief of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, likened Gaza to “hell on earth” and said of video footage of an UNRWA school being blown up: “It is outrageous.”
“All public facilities, including hospitals & @UN schools are protected under international law,” he posted on X, formerly Twitter.
The Gaza health ministry today updated its death toll in Gaza to 18,412, mostly women and children.
The militant Islamist group said Israeli forces raided a hospital in Gaza City, the biggest urban centre.
“Israeli occupation forces are storming Kamal Adwan hospital after besieging and bombing it for days,” health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said, accusing troops of rounding up men in the hospital courtyard, including medical staff.
The army did not immediately comment, but Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals, schools, mosques and tunnels beneath them as military bases – claims it has denied.
The UN humanitarian agency OCHA said earlier that “the hospital remains surrounded by Israeli troops and tanks, and fighting with armed groups has been reported in its vicinity for three consecutive days”.
It said two mothers were killed in a strike on the maternity ward, and that about 3,000 displaced people were trapped in the facility.
The conflict began with Hamas’s 7 October attacks that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures, and saw around 240 hostages taken back to Gaza.

Israel has responded to the unprecedented attack with an offensive aiming to destroy Hamas that has reduced much of Gaza to rubble.

Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
The United Nations said its satellite analysis agency UNOSAT had determined, based on a November 26 image, that 18 percent of Gaza’s infrastructure had been destroyed.
UN agencies and aid groups fear the territory will soon be overwhelmed by starvation and disease, and are pleading with Israel to boost efforts to protect civilians.
UN human rights chief Volker Turk warned the humanitarian situation there was “beyond breakdown”.
The world body estimates 1.9 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been displaced by the conflict, half of them children.
Israeli air strikes today killed at least 24 people in Rafah, where tens of thousands are seeking shelter, the Gaza health ministry said.
One left a deep crater and gutted surrounding buildings.
“There are still people under the rubble,” said resident Abu Jazar, 23. ”We call on the Arab people and the world to put on pressure to stop the strikes on Gaza.”

At Rafah hospital, bereaved father Hani Abu Jamaa cradled the body of his young daughter Sidal, who was killed by shrapnel.
He said there had been strong explosions overnight and he only found she was dead when he tried to wake her in the morning.
“Even if I live 100 years, I will never find another like her,” he said, crying. “May God have mercy on her, oh Lord.”
Israel yesterday said it will conductadditional examinations on relief supplies, before they are dispatched to the Palestinian territory through the Rafah crossing.
Israel’s military said it had struck a rocket launch site in Jabalia that had fired on Sderot in southern Israel, and also found hundreds of shells and rocket-propelled grenade launchers in a Hamas compound.
The military has lost 105 soldiers in the offensive, it said today, including 13 killed by friendly fire and others in accidents.
It said two “fell” and others were wounded in a Gaza operation in which the army recovered the bodies of two hostages – Ziv Dado and Eden Zecharya.
Army spokesman Daniel Hagari said 135 hostages remained in Gaza.

In Gaza City, thousands of Palestinians set up camp at a UN agency headquarters after homes and shops were destroyed by Israeli strikes.
An AFP correspondent said both the Islamic and adjacent Al-Azhar universities had been reduced to rubble, as had the police station.
“There is no water. There is no electricity, no bread, no milk for the children, and no diapers,” said Rami al-Dahduh, 23, a tailor.
The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a non-binding resolution this evening demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.
“We condemn anyone who encourages Israel to continue its killings,” Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said ahead of the vote.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said following a conversation with US President Joe Biden that there was “disagreement” between the allies over “the day after Hamas.”
Biden said later the Israeli government was opposed to a two-state solution and called on Netanyahu to “change the administration”, revealing a rare rift between the two sides.
Biden said Israel was starting to lose support around the world and that Netanyahu “has to strengthen and change” his government to find a long-term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In the occupied West Bank, where violence has escalated since the conflict began, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians in the city of Jenin, health officials said.
Fears of a wider conflict continue to grow, with Iran-backed groups targeting US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria, and daily exchanges of fire along Israel’s border with Lebanon.
The Israeli army said in response to projectiles fired today from Lebanon and Syria, it retaliated by striking launch sites.
France said one of its frigates shot down a drone threatening a Norwegian-flagged tanker hit in an overnight missile attack claimed by Iran-backed Huthi rebels.

'It's unconscionable': Politicians to boycott US ambassador’s Christmas party over 'Israeli bombardment',"LAST UPDATE|12 Dec 2023
A PLANNED CHRISTMAS dinner at the US ambassador’s residence tonight is set to be boycotted by several politicians over the country’s backing of Israel’s attacks on Gaza.
People Before Profit and Dublin City Council’s Independent group said it was “unconscionable” to try to “continue the pretence that we can celebrate the holiday season while innocent people” are killed in Gaza by Israel’s onslaught of the region.
PBP called on all members of the Oireachtas to boycott the ambassador’s Christmas party, while the Irish Anti-War Movement (IAWM) called a protest for outside the residence.
An invitation has been extended by the US ambassador Claire Cronin to a ‘Holiday Reception’ in her residence in Phoenix Park.
It’s set to start at 6pm, but opponents have scheduled a protest outside the residence for 5pm as guests make their way into the residence.
When asked by PBP TD Richard Boyd Barrett to boycott the event during Leaders’ Questions today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he will not be attending as he has a prior engagement but he said the decision on whether or not to go was one for individuals to make on their own.
The Taoiseach will instead be attending a Christmas carol service in Maynooth seminary this evening.
It is also understood that Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin will not be attending as he also has a prior engagement.
Labour TDs said earlier today that no one from their party will attend tonight’s event either.
Meanwhile however, Fine Gael TD and former Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan toldThe Journalthat although he is not going, he believes this is “another example of the intolerance of the Left.”
“Dialogue and direct face-to-face contact is always preferable to boycott,” he said.
“Some of the most vocal against the function have not even been invited. Diplomacy is a most valuable tool in international relations. This boycott call is the latest example of the intolerance of the Irish Left.
“God help us if they are ever in power,” he added.
The Union of Students in Ireland will join the protest this evening, alongside activists from Action for Palestine Ireland, the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Saoirse don Phalastín and Dublin 15 for Palestine.
DCC’s Independent group said that rather than attending the ambassador’s dinner, it would instead use the opportunity to “highlight US complicity in the genocidal Israeli bombardment in Gaza”, and further criticised the US vetoing a United Nations proposal for a ceasefire last week.

“It’s unconscionable that anyone would argue against a ceasefire in such a horrific situation knowing that the decision is a guarantee of further deaths of innocent children, women and men,” the Independents said.
The councillors who refusing to attend include Christy Burke, Pat Dunne, Mannix Flynn, Vincent Jackson, John Lyons, Sophie Nicoullaud, Damian O’Farrell, Cieran Perry, Noeleen Reilly and Nial Ring.
“Doctors without Borders has said the US veto of the UN resolution makes it complicit in the carnage in Gaza.”
Independent group leader on DCC Ciaren Perry said it reiterates calls for an immediate ceasefire and for the release of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
“With the death toll at over 17,000 and rising, we must take every opportunity to highlight the continuing massacre of children, women and men,” Perry said.
The Independent group, comprises 10 councillors, were part of the group behind having thePalestinian flag flown above City Hall last weekas a sign of solidarity with people in Gaza.
Councillor Sophie Nicoullaud said contrasted Cronin’s invite to “celebrate the joys of the season” while Israel continues to “slaughter innocent civilians with the support of the US”.
Veteran councillor and former Lord Mayor Christy Burke said that rather than the American government using its influence with Israel to stop the “indiscriminate slaughter in Gaza”, “the opposite” has happened with last Friday’s vetoing of the UN call for a ceasefire.
As a result, Burke said, “It’s no time to celebrate with the ambassador.”
PBP’s Dublin South-Central TD Bríd Smith also called on all members of the Oireachtas to boycott the US Ambassador’s ‘Holiday Reception’ at the US Residence in the Phoenix Park, on Tuesday December 12.
Smith said that TDs and Senators who would have received the invitation should not attend the event in solidarity with the people of Gaza who are undergoing an “ongoing brutal bombardment” by the Israeli military, adding the attacks amounted to “genocide and ethnic cleansing” of Palestinians.
“I will not be attending out of solidarity with the people of Gaza and the West Bank who are undergoing intense and appalling atrocities by the IDF and illegal settlers, with the backing of the United States,” she said.
Jim Roche, spokesperson for the IAWM said that if the “Irish Government is serious about getting a ceasefire in Gaza, then it should instruct all their TDs to boycott this event.”
He said this would send a clear message to the US government that its continued support for this “barbarous, genocidal Israeli onslaught in Gaza” is not supported in Ireland.
He added that US president Joe Biden and all of the US Government have the “blood of innocent Gazans, including 10,000 children, on their hands” due to the war.
“Irish TDs must not condone the US Government’s part in Israel’s genocidal violence so they should stay away from this Christmas event at the US Ambassador’s residence,” Roche said.

Israel to carry out examinations of relief supplies entering into Gaza,"
ISRAEL SAID YESTERDAY it will conduct additional examinations on relief supplies, before they are dispatched to the Palestinian territory through the Rafah crossing.
International aid organisations have struggled to get supplies to desperate Gazans under Israeli bombardment, with only the Rafah crossing in Egypt open.
While no direct crossings will be opened, the Kerem Shalom crossing will be used to carry out checks before sending the trucks through Rafah.
“This is being done to improve the volume of security screenings of aid entering Gaza via the Rafah Crossing and will enable us to double the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza,” the army said on X, formerly Twitter.
Similar checks are already being carried out at the Nitzana border post.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) this morning reiterated its call for the protection of health care and humanitarian assistance in Gaza after it witnessed that the establishment of military checkpoints were being delayed.
On a mission to the Gaza Strip to deliver medical aid and assist with the transferring of patients, where one patient reportedly died, WHO saw the detention of health partners and workers.
“The difficulties faced by this mission illustrate the shrinking space for humanitarian actors to provide aid within Gaza, even though access is desperately needed to alleviate the catastrophic humanitarian situation…,” WHO said in a statement today.

It added: “WHO and partners remain firmly committed to staying in Gaza and assisting the population.
“But as hostilities increase across Gaza, aid falls short of needs, the humanitarian support system is on the verge of falling apart.
“The only viable solution is a sustained ceasefire, so WHO and partners can work safely and unhindered to strengthen a deteriorating health system, replenish critical supplies of fuel, medicines, and other essential aid, and prevent disease, hunger, and further suffering in the Gaza Strip.
The additional checkpoint will screen “trucks containing water, food, medical supplies and shelter equipment”, according to a joint statement from the Israeli army and COGAT, the defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs.
The UN General Assembly will meet today to discuss the humanitarian crisis, after the United States last weekvetoed a Security Council resolution for a ceasefire.
UN humanitarian agency OCHA said Sunday that around 100 trucks per day were bringing humanitarian supplies from Egypt into Gaza since a week-long truce ended on December 1, compared with a daily average of 500 before the war.
Heavy urban battles raged Monday in the bloodiest-ever war in Gaza, with more than 18,200 Palestinians and 104 Israeli soldiers reported dead.
Israel’s assault on Gaza was triggered after Hamas, which rules the territory, launched a bloody attack on southern Israel on 7 October that left 1,200 people dead, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials.

Pro-Palestinian demonstration held outside US ambassador’s residence in Dublin,"A NUMBER OF pro-Palestinian protesters were forcibly dragged away from the gates of the US ambassador’s residence in Dublin this evening during a protest against the country’s support of Israel.
More than 100 protesters, some banging drums and waving Palestinian flags, staged a protest on the roadway leading to the residence inside Phoenix Park.
A large Garda deployment, including a mounted unit, was present at the scene and after some protesters blocked the roadway in a sit-down protest, barriers were erected to prevent the public approaching the residence.
Several cars had turned around as the protest prevented access through main entrances and exits to a key roundabout in the park during rush hour.

Gardaí also prevented public access to a nearby car park.
At least two protesters were dragged by gardaí away from the closed gates of the residence, which was hosting a Christmas dinner for politicians. The dinner is beingboycotted by several politicians.
The two protesters, along with a Palestinian flag which had been dropped, were returned to the main group of demonstrators behind the garda barriers.
Some demonstrators sat on the roadway as others chanted pro-Palestinian slogans, including “United States you can’t hide, you’re committing genocide”, “Biden out”, “ceasefire now” and “free, free Palestine”.
Three men wearing only their underwear and with their eyes covered by blindfolds also kneeled on the ground as part of the demonstration, in a reference to images of IDF detainees in Gaza.
Other protesters, many of whom were wearing keffiyehs or draped in Palestinian flags, called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in Dublin.

People Before Profit TD Brid Smith, who said she was invited to the event in the residency, said protesters were “very angry” with a US veto of a UN Security Council resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Speaking to the PA news agency, she said: “So directly and indirectly they are responsible for all the children on whom bombs are falling, injuring them, the hospitals that are being lost, the schools being lost, the lives are being lost, the destruction, the trauma and the dreadful, unspeakable acts that are happening.”
Smith said the protest was to call on politicians to boycott the event and to send a message to the ambassador that the US’ “behaviour is unacceptable”.

Puma to end sponsorship deal with Israeli national football team,"GERMAN SPORTSWEAR MAKER Puma has said it would end a sponsorship deal with the Israeli national football team in a decision made before the beginning of the conflict in Gaza.
Following a strategy review carried out at the end of 2022, Puma would stop outfitting the Israeli team from next year, the company said.
“While two newly signed national teams – including a new statement team – will be announced later this year and in 2024, the contracts of some federations such as Serbia and Israel will expire in 2024,” a spokeswoman said in a statement.
“These decisions were taken in 2022 in line with the regular timelines for the design (and) development of the team jerseys,” the spokeswoman said.
The deal with Israel, which was signed in 2018, prompted calls to boycott the sportswear brand.
Campaigners accused Puma of endorsing illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank through its deal with the Israeli FA, which includes teams from the occupied Palestinian territory.

The outbreak in October of the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, has strengthened longstanding calls to boycott products which support Israel.
The Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign today responded to the news from Puma, tweeting: “Amazing news! #BDS is unstoppable. Well done everyone for campaigning so hard for this, it’s great to see some light in these dark times. Keep chipping away. It can be done.”

The Financial Times, which first reported the story today, said the pro-Palestinian BDS campaign claimed on X, formerly Twitter, that the decision to end the partnership was a direct response to its longstanding calls for a boycott.
However, the Financial Times reported that the Israeli FA has rejected the claim, calling it a “pathetic attempt … to mislead”.
The Israeli FA reportedly said it had an option to extend the contract by two years until 2026 but decided in September against doing so after failing to reach agreement over improved contractual terms and conditions.

Zara apologises and pulls advert over claims it had similarities to scenes emerging from Gaza,"GLOBAL FASHION BRAND Zara has apologised and pulled its atelier ad campaign for their “The Jacket” product after it faced criticism from pro-Palestinian activists, urging to boycott the brand.
The Jacket ad campaign displayed its black leather jacket with a backdrop of mannequins who had limbs missing and were covered in white sheets and bubble wrap.
Covering mannequins or body lookalikes in white sheets has been a frequent form of demonstration by pro-Palestinian activists in recent months to protest the bombardment of Gaza by Israeli Forces.

Activists rallied online to boycott the fashion brand and denounced the ad campaign, which they claimed had similarities to the real images emerging from inside the Gaza Strip.
Today, Zara pulled the campaign and posted an apology to their social media pages.
In the statement, the company said it had listened to customers and decided to pull the campaign over their concerns.

“The campaign, that was conceived in July and photographed in September, presents a series of images of unfinished sculptures in a sculptor’s studio and was created with the sole purpose of showcasing craftmade garments in an artistic context,” it said.
As per the claims made by the company, the campaign was organised and put together before Hamas attacked Israeli villages on 7 October, killing over 1,200 people who were mostly civilian, which sparked the latest shelling and bombardment of the Gaza Strip, where Hamas control.
“Unfortunately, some customers felt offended by these images, which have now been removed, and saw in them something far from what was intended when they were created,” the company continued.

“Zara regrets that misunderstanding and we reaffirm our deep respect towards everyone,” it added.

A Zara store in Canada overnight had been vandalised with graffiti reading ‘Free Gaza’ on the storefront window, where a similar display to the campaign had been set up.
The hashtag #BoycottZara had also been trending on X, formerly Twitter, for some time.

Israel continues bombing in south Gaza as Hamas issues warning over lives of hostages,"LAST UPDATE|11 Dec 2023

HEAVY URBAN BATTLES have raged today in the bloodiest-ever conflict in Gaza, with more than 18,200 Palestinians and 104 Israeli soldiers reported dead amid a spiralling humanitarian crisis.
Hamas, who crossed the border into southern Israel on 7 October and killed 1,200 people, warned the remaining 137 hostages it is holding won’t survive the conflict unless Israel meets its demands and frees more Palestinian prisoners.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the Islamist group to “surrender now”, after his national security adviser claimed thousands of militants have been killed during the war, now in its third month.
“It is the beginning of the end of Hamas. I say to the Hamas terrorists: It’s over,” the right-wing premier said yesterday.
But brutal fighting continued today in Gaza, with Islamic Jihad militants saying they blew up a house in the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis where Israeli soldiers were searching for a tunnel shaft.
Rockets fired from Gaza hit Holon on the edge of Tel Aviv, injuring a civilian and leaving a crater in a residential street.

The last death toll from the Gaza health ministry was 18,205, mostly women and children. It said 32 dead had arrived at Khan Yunis’s Nasser hospital alone in 24 hours.
The conflict has devastated health services, with only 14 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals functioning at any capacity, according to UN humanitarian agency OCHA.
Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah was inundated with victims, including dozens of screaming children, after Israeli strikes on the nearby Al-Maghazi refugee camp.
Women and girls have meanwhile been forced to use scraps of cloth for menstrual periods as sanitary conditions deteriorate.
“I cut up my kid’s clothes or any piece of cloth I find,” said 25-year-old Hala Ataya in Rafah.
Unable to obtain gas or even firewood for cooking, Gazans brought decades-old brass stoves to a workshop for repair.
“People have gone back to the old times,” owner Ibrahim Shouman said.

AFP visited the Al-Shifa hospital complex in Gaza City and found at least 30,000 people taking refuge amid the rubble after Israeli forces raided the facility last month.
In the nearby Al-Rimal area, an AFP correspondent saw thousands of Palestinians had set up camp at a UN agency headquarters.
They had fled Israeli strikes that destroyed dozens of nearby residential buildings and shops. The correspondent said both the Islamic and adjacent Al-Azhar universities had been reduced to rubble, as had the police station.
“There is no water. There is no electricity, no bread, no milk for the children, and no diapers,” said Rami al-Dahduh, 23, a tailor, who reported seeing tanks on his way to the facility on Saturday.
Palestinian groups called for a general strike today in solidarity with Gaza. Many shops, schools and government offices were shut across the Israeli-occupied West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, as well as in Lebanon.

Qatar 'continuing' to try renew war truce as US sends more tank ammunition to Israel,"LAST UPDATE|10 Dec 2023
MEDIATION EFFORTS ARE continuing to secure a new Gaza ceasefire despite ongoing Israeli bombardment that is “narrowing the window” for a successful outcome, Qatar’s prime minister has said.
“Our efforts as the state of Qatar along with our partners are continuing. We are not going to give up,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told the Doha Forum more than two months into the Israel-Hamas war.
Qatar was a key mediator in negotiations that resulted in a seven-day truce, which saw scores of Israeli hostages exchanged for Palestinians prisoners and humanitarian aid, until it ended at the start of the month.
“We are going to continue, we are committed to have hostages released, but we are also committed to stop the war,” the Qatari premier said.
But, he added, “we are not seeing the same willingness from both parties” and “the continuation of the bombardment is just narrowing this window for us”.
Addressing the Doha Forum earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Security Council was “paralysed by geostrategic divisions” that were undermining solutions to the conflict.
The body’s “authority and credibility were severely undermined” by its delayed response to the war, he said two days after a US veto prevented a resolution calling for a Gaza ceasefire.
Munitions
Heavy fighting has raged in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis as Israel pressed ahead with its offensive after the US blocked the latest international efforts to halt the fighting and rushed more munitions to its ally.
Israel has faced rising international outrage and calls for a ceasefire after the killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians and the displacement of nearly 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people within the besieged territory, where UN agencies say there is no safe place to flee.
But the United States has lent vital support to the offensive once again in recent days by vetoing United Nations Security Council efforts to end the fighting that enjoyed wide international support, and by pushing through an emergency sale of over 100 million dollars worth of tank ammunition to Israel.
The US has pledged unwavering support for Israel’s goal of crushing Hamas’s military and governing abilities in order to prevent any repeat of the October 7 attack that triggered the war.

Hamas and other Palestinian militants stormed into southern Israel that day, killing 1,200 people and capturing 240, over 100 of whom were released during a week-long ceasefire late last month.
In response to the attack, Israel launched a devastating air and ground war that has killed thousands of Palestinians, mostly civilians, and forced some 1.9 million people to flee their homes, according to UN agencies.
With only a trickle of aid allowed in, and delivery rendered impossible in much of the territory, Palestinians face severe shortages of food, water and other basic goods.
Israeli forces continue to face heavy resistance, even in northern Gaza, where entire neighbourhoods have been flattened by air strikes and where troops have been operating for over six weeks.
Mass expulsion
The head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees has accused Israel of laying the groundwork for the mass expulsion of Gazans across the territory’s border into Egypt.
More than two months of deadly war between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the militant group’s October 7 attacks, have displaced most of Gaza’s population, but Palestinians are largely barred from leaving the narrow besieged territory.
In an opinion piece published yesterday in the Los Angeles Times, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini pointed to the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the increasing concentration near the border of displaced civilians who fled the fighting, first in the north and then further south.

“The United Nations and several member states, including the US, have firmly rejected forcibly displacing Gazans out of the Gaza Strip,” Lazzarini said.
“But the developments we are witnessing point to attempts to move Palestinians into Egypt, regardless of whether they stay there or are resettled elsewhere.”
The widespread destruction in the Palestinian territory’s north and the resulting displacements were “the first stage of such a scenario”, he added, while forcing civilians from the southern city of Khan Yunis closer to the border was the next.
“If this path continues, leading to what many are already calling a second Nakba, Gaza will not be a land for Palestinians anymore,” Lazzarini said, using the Arabic term for the exodus or forced displacement of 760,000 Palestinians during the war that coincided with Israel’s creation in 1948.
A spokesperson for the Israeli defence ministry office responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lazzarini’s accusation.
When asked about the possibility of evacuating people into Egypt last week, a government spokesman said Israel was “focusing on getting civilians out of harm’s way inside the Gaza Strip”.
A small number of Gazans have been allowed to cross into Egypt for medical treatment, and some foreign nationals trapped in the territory at the outset of the war were also allowed to evacuate by way of the Rafah crossing — Gaza’s only border not under Israeli control.
‘It doesn’t stop’
In Khan Younis, where ground forces moved in earlier this month, residents said they heard constant gunfire and explosions through the night as warplanes bombarded areas in and around the southern city, Gaza’s second largest.
“It doesn’t stop,” said Radwa Abu Frayeh, who lives close to the European Hospital in Khan Younis. “There’s bombing, and then the ambulances head out to bring back victims.”
Israel ordered the evacuation of the northern third of the territory, including Gaza City, early in the war, but tens of thousands of people are believed to have remained there, fearing that the south would be no safer or that they would never be allowed to return to their homes.
Blindfolded
In recent days, videos and photos have emerged showing the detention of dozens of men who were stripped to their underwear, bound and blindfolded. The Israeli military says it is detaining people as it searches for remaining pockets of Hamas fighters.
Israel’s Channel 13 TV broadcast footage showing dozens of detainees stripped to their underwear with their hands in the air.
Several held assault rifles above their heads, and one man could be seen slowly walking forward and placing a gun on the ground before returning to the group. Israeli media pointed to such scenes as evidence that Hamas was collapsing in the north.
Men from a separate group of detainees who were released yesterday told The Associated Press they had been beaten and denied food and water.
Osama Oula said Israeli troops had ordered him and others out of a building in Gaza City before bounding their hands with zip ties, beating them for several days and giving them little water to drink.
Ahmad Nimr Salman showed his hands, marked and swollen from the zip ties.
He said the troops asked if they were with Hamas. “We say ‘no,’ then they would slap us or kick us,” he said. He added that his 17-year-old son Amjad is still held by the troops.
The group was released after five days and told to walk south. Ten freed detainees arrived at a hospital in Deir al-Balah on Saturday after flagging down an ambulance. The Israeli military had no comment when asked about the alleged abuse.
With the war in its third month, the Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 17,700, the majority women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.

Israeli hostage allegedly killed in Gaza amid failed rescue operation,"LAST UPDATE|9 Dec 2023
AN ISRAELI HOSTAGE held by Hamas in Gaza has allegedly been killed, the man’s kibbutz community said, after the Palestinian militant group claimed he had died during a failed rescue attempt.
Sahar Baruch, 25, is the latest confirmed fatality among scores of Israelis and foreigners taken captive during Hamas’s October 7 attacks on southern Israel.
Separate statements from the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Hamas confirmed that a hostage rescue operation took place without success.
Beeri, the Gaza border community Baruch was from, and the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a joint statement he had been “murdered”.
“It is with deep sorrow and a broken heart that we announce the murder of Sahar Baruch,” the statement said.
Israel earlier this week counted 138 hostages who remain in Gaza, out of around 240 taken on October 7 during attacks that officials say killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
Israel’s retaliatory bombardment and ground offensive targeting Hamas has killed at least 17,490 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to the latest toll from the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry.
On Friday the Israeli army said two soldiers were wounded in an overnight hostage rescue operation that failed to retrieve any captives.
It said “numerous terrorists who took part in the abducting and holding of hostages were killed”.
Hamas said fighters of its military wing, Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, had “succeeded in foiling an Israeli attempt to free an Israeli captive”.
“A fierce gunfight broke out between al-Qassam fighters and the Israeli special force, leaving many soldiers wounded while the captive Israeli… was announced killed,” Hamas said in an English-language statement late on Friday.
It released a video showing what it said was the hostage’s body. AFP was unable to independently verify its authenticity.

Kibbutz Beeri was one of the worst hit communities in Hamas’s October 7 attacks. Out of a population of 1,100, more than 80 were killed including Baruch’s brother Idan, according to today’s statement.
“We will demand the return of his body as part of any abductee return deal,” said the kibbutz and the forum representing hostages and their families. “We won’t stop until everyone is home.”
A one-week truce that ended on December 1 saw 105 hostages released from Gaza, including foreigners as well as 80 Israelis — mostly women and children — freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians jailed by Israel.
Fighting continued in the region today, hours after the US vetoed a United Nations resolution backed by the vast majority of Security Council members demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.
The vote came amid Palestinian civilians facing what the UN chief called a “humanitarian nightmare”.
US deputy ambassador Robert Wood criticised the council after the vote for its failure to condemn Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel in which the militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, or to acknowledge Israel’s right to defend itself.
He declared that halting military action would allow Hamas to continue to rule Gaza and “only plant the seeds for the next war”.
“For that reason, while the United States strongly supports a durable peace, in which both Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security, we do not support calls for an immediate ceasefire,” Wood said.
Israel’s more than two-month military campaign has killed more than 17,400 people in Gaza — 70% of them women and children — and wounded more than 46,000, according to the Palestinian territory’s Health Ministry, which says many others are trapped under rubble. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.
In their latest round of operations, the Israeli military has begun rounding up Palestinian men in northern Gaza for interrogation during its search for Hamas militants.

Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy said on Friday that those detained in northern Gaza were “military-aged men who were discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago”.
UN monitors said Israeli troops reportedly detained men and boys from the age of 15 in a school-turned-shelter.
Israeli Defence Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said that in the past 48 hours, some 200 people have been detained. Dozens have been taken to Israel for interrogation, including Hamas commanders, he said.
The detentions pointed to Israeli efforts to secure the military’s hold on northern Gaza as the war enters its third month.
The first images of mass detentions emerged on Thursday from the northern town of Beit Lahiya, showing dozens of men kneeling or sitting in the streets, stripped down to their underwear, their hands bound behind their backs.
The London-based news outlet Al-Araby al-Jadeed, or The New Arab, said one of the men seen in the images of the detainees is its Gaza correspondent Diaa al-Kahlout, and that he was rounded up with other civilians.
Elsewhere in the region, Yemen’s Houthi rebels threatened on Saturday to attack any vessels heading to Israeli ports unless food and medicine were allowed into the besieged Gaza Strip.
In a statement posted on social media, the Huthis said they “will prevent the passage of ships heading to the Zionist entity” if humanitarian aid is not allowed into Hamas-ruled Gaza.
Israel’s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said his country would not accept the “naval siege”.
“If the world will not take care of it,” Hanegbi warned on Israel’s Channel 12 television, “we will take action to remove the naval siege.”
Last week, the Houthis attacked two ships off the Yemeni coast, including a Bahamas-flagged vessel, claiming they were Israeli-owned.
Beyond maritime attacks, the Houthis have launched a series of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel since the outbreak of war on 7 October.
The council called the emergency meeting to hear from secretary-general Antonio Guterres, who for the first time invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter, which enables a UN chief to raise threats he sees to international peace and security.
He warned of a “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza and urged the council to demand a humanitarian ceasefire.
More than 60% of Gaza’s housing has reportedly been destroyed or damaged, some 85% of the population has been forced from their homes, the health system is collapsing, and “nowhere in Gaza is safe”, Guterres said.
Peter Power, executive director at UNICEF Ireland, said that the situation in Gaza is unconscionable.
“The Gaza Strip is now the most dangerous place in the world to be a child. Our colleagues on the ground are completely overwhelmed as they attend to children with missing limbs and third-degree burns.
“Rather than resting and recovering from their injuries, they no longer have homes to do this in and face the daily reality of forcible displacement further south, where over one million children are already living in overcrowded squalor.”
Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian UN ambassador, told the council that Israel’s objective is “the ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip” and “the dispossession and forcible displacement of the Palestinian people”.
“If you are against the destruction and displacement of the Palestinian people, you have to be in favour of an immediate ceasefire,” Mansour said. “When you refuse to call for a ceasefire, you are refusing to call for the only thing that can put an end to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.”
Israel’s UN ambassador Gilad Erdan stressed that regional stability and the security of Israelis and Gazans “can only be achieved once Hamas is eliminated – not one minute before”.
“So the true path to ensure peace is only through supporting Israel’s mission — absolutely not to call for a ceasefire,” he told the council.
In Washington, Jordan’s top diplomat told reporters that the killings of Palestinian civilians in Israel’s bombardment and siege of Gaza were war crimes and threatened to destabilise the region, the US and the world for years to come.

US vetoes UN Security Council resolution calling for immediate Gaza ceasefire,"LAST UPDATE|8 Dec 2023
THE UNITED STATES today vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that would have called for an immediate ceasefire in the intense fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
The United States’ deputy representative at the UN, Robert Wood, said the resolution was “divorced from reality” and “would have not moved the needle forward on the ground.”
Fighting raged today across Gaza between Israel and Hamas as the UN Security Council was due to meet to discuss a ceasefire in a war now in its third month.
Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 240 hostages, Israeli officials say.
In response, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas and launched a military offensive in Gaza that has killed nearly 17,500 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the region.
During a seven-day truce that expired on December 1, Gaza militants released 105 hostages, including 80 Israelis, in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says 138 hostages remain in Gaza.
Here are five key developments from the past 24 hours:
Gaza’s health ministry said today the death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has risen to at least 17,487 in the Palestinian territory.
The ministry reported 40 dead in Israeli strikes near Gaza City and “dozens” more in the northern Jabalia refugee camp and Khan Yunis.
Israeli forces have encircled major urban centres as they seek to destroy Hamas over its unprecedented attack.
Its army said it had struck more than 450 targets over a 24-hour period.

The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.
Philippe Lazzarini urged all UN member states to “take immediate actions to implement an immediate humanitarian ceasefire”, saying in a statement that “calling for an end to the decimation of the lives of Palestinians in Gaza is not a denial of the abhorrent attacks of 7 October in Israel”.
Top US diplomat Antony Blinken welcomed an Israeli investigation into a strike that killed a Reuters journalist and wounded six others, including two from AFP, on October 13 in southern Lebanon.
“It is important and appropriate that it be fully and thoroughly investigated,” he said at a news conference.
An AFP investigation published Thursday found the strike involved a tank shell that is only used by Israel in the region, and that it was fired from a location where Israeli tanks were operating.
The Israeli army said on Friday the area had been an “active combat zone” and that “the incident is currently under review”.
The US embassy in Baghdad was targeted in a multi-rocket attack on Friday morning.
US officials said there were no casualties.
There were a further five attempted attacks on US and anti-jihadist coalition forces in Iraq and Syria on Friday, none of which caused casualties, a US official said.
There have been 84 such attacks since October 17, with most claimed by pro-Iran groups opposed to US support for Israel.
Israeli forces shot dead at least six Palestinians in a raid on the Al-Fara refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The Israeli army said it conducted a joint “counter-terrorism” operation with the Shin Bet internal security agency.

"Ireland 'very open' to imposing travel ban on 'violent' West Bank settlers, says Tánaiste","LAST UPDATE|11 Dec 2023
TÁNAISTE AND MINISTER for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has spoken of the need to progress European Union sanctions against “violent” settlers in the West Bank, ahead of today’s meeting of EU Foreign Ministers.
The Tánaiste is in Brussels today for the meeting where the Council will focus discussions on the EU’s support for Ukraine and its response to the situation in Gaza.
He said “very specific sanctions” could be applied to settlers on the West Bank who are “undermining any possibility of a contiguous two-state solution to the Middle East”.
When asked if Ireland could take measures nationally, such as travel bans on individuals, Martin said “we can, and we’re certainly very open to that”.
“In the context of the West Bank and sanctions, Martin said he is “very worried in terms of what is transpiring and the extreme violence of settlers in the West Bank who are terrorising Palestinians, causing the displacement of Palestinians, attacking schools and demolishing schools”.
“We believe and we will be calling for sanctions to be applied to extreme terrorist settlers on the West Bank and we’ll be calling for that today at today’s meeting,” said Martin.
Normally, the government wants to work with Europe in terms of sanctions, said Martin, but certainly in terms of imposing a travel ban on some individuals, “we’re very open to that”, he reiterated.
“But we want to push that the EU should do it as an entity, notwithstanding the challenges… But we have to be very clear, I think from a European Union level, that we do not in any way find this behavior by the settlers acceptable, that we must take action to demonstrate both symbolically and in real terms, our opposition to what’s going on in the West Bank right now,” he said.
Martin added: “I believe there are many people within Israeli society who do not accept what the settlers are doing, and understand how undermining their behaviour is of the ultimate objective of Palestinians and Israelis living in harmony, side by side.”
The Journal/ YouTube
The Tánaiste’s comments come as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar jointly signed a letter alongside Spain, Belgium and Malta urging EU leaders to call for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.
The letter, seen byThe Journal, states: “It is time for the European Union to act. Our credibility is at stake.”
It also calls for the urgent convening an international peace conference with the all parties as soon as possible, in order to implement the two-state solution, in line with the European Council agreement in October.
“Two months since hostilities broke out, the death toll, the level of destruction, and the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip are alarming,” states the letter signed by four country leaders.
“We have reached a moment in which the European Union must go further,” it adds.

Today in Brussels, the Tánaiste will reiterate the urgent need to intensify calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.
Speaking ahead of the meeting, the Tánaiste said the motivation behind the letter Ireland co-signed is to call “to end the carnage, to end the slaughter of innocent civilians”.
“The level of bombardment is on a scale that we haven’t witnessed before and it is resulting in death and misery on an unacceptable scale,” he told reporters.
He said it is “vital” the EU calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
“What the people of Gaza are going through is horrifying. There is no justification for the continuing bombardment and the killing of innocent men, women and children.
“The UN Secretary General’s invocation of Article 99 should be a call to action for the international community,” he said.
“The situation we are seeing on the ground demands our reaction and we should respond to what we are seeing also in the West Bank, and progress EU sanctions against violent settlers,” Martin added.
Speaking to reporters this morning, the Tánaiste said:
The bombardment of Gaza is “absolutely unacceptable”, he said, stating that to witness the loss of the lives of so many children “is absolutely horrifying”.
The Tánaiste confirmed that there are some Irish citizens remaining in Palestine, some who opted not to leave and others who were not allowed out.
Ireland is consistently pressing for their release, he said.
Last week, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres used a rarely exercised power, urging members of the UN Security Council todemand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
Article 99 allows the secretary-general to inform the Security Council of matters they believe threaten international peace and security.
Guterres’ letter to the council’s 15 members said Gaza’s humanitarian system was at risk of collapse after two months of war that has created “appalling human suffering, physical destruction and collective trauma”.
Elsewhere, in relation to today’s discussion on Ukraine, the EU Foreign Ministers will consider EU options for further support, including financial and security assistance, as well as further sanctions against Russia and Ukraine’s EU membership perspective.

More than 60% of Gaza’s housing has reportedly been destroyed or damaged, some 85% of the population has been forced from their homes, the health system is collapsing, and “nowhere in Gaza is safe”, Guterres said.
Peter Power, executive director at UNICEF Ireland, said that the situation in Gaza is unconscionable.
“The Gaza Strip is now the most dangerous place in the world to be a child. Our colleagues on the ground are completely overwhelmed as they attend to children with missing limbs and third-degree burns.
“Rather than resting and recovering from their injuries, they no longer have homes to do this in and face the daily reality of forcible displacement further south, where over one million children are already living in overcrowded squalor.”
Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian UN ambassador, told the council that Israel’s objective is “the ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip” and “the dispossession and forcible displacement of the Palestinian people”.
“If you are against the destruction and displacement of the Palestinian people, you have to be in favour of an immediate ceasefire,” Mansour said. “When you refuse to call for a ceasefire, you are refusing to call for the only thing that can put an end to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.”
Israel’s UN ambassador Gilad Erdan stressed that regional stability and the security of Israelis and Gazans “can only be achieved once Hamas is eliminated – not one minute before”.
“So the true path to ensure peace is only through supporting Israel’s mission — absolutely not to call for a ceasefire,” he told the council.
In Washington, Jordan’s top diplomat told reporters that the killings of Palestinian civilians in Israel’s bombardment and siege of Gaza were war crimes and threatened to destabilise the region, the US and the world for years to come.

Head of UN agency for Palestine 'predicts the killing of staff' in Gaza,"THE HEAD OF the United Nations’ agency for Palestinian refugees has warned that he expects staff in Gaza will be killed and that the organisation is “hanging on by our fingertips”.
At least 70% of UNRWA staff are displaced and lack food, water and adequate shelter, according to Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini.
Israeli forces are bombarding Gaza’s main cities today, continuing weeks of attacks that have killed more than 17,000 people, mostly women and children.
Lazzarini has written to the President of the UN General Assembly at what he described as the “darkest hour in the agency’s 75-year history”.
Nearly 1.2 million civilians are sheltering in UNRWA premises and it is the primary provider of humanitarian assistance to over 2.2 million people.
However, it is “on the verge of collapse”.
“UNRWA is, as of today, still operational in Gaza, though just barely.
“Our staff are still operating health centers, managing shelters, and supporting traumatized people, some arriving carrying their dead children. We are still distributing food, even though the corridors and courtyards of our premises are too crowded to walk through. Our staff take their children to work so they know they are safe or can die together.
“We are hanging on by our fingertips. If UNRWA collapses, humanitarian assistance in Gaza will also collapse.”

In my 35 years of work in complex emergencies, I never have expected to write such a letter, predicting the killing of my staff & the collapse of the mandate I am expected to fulfill#Gazapic.twitter.com/b2S9WAapCt
Lazzarini said the humanitarian situation is now “untenable” and called on the Assembly to “implement an immediate humanitarian ceasefire; enforce international law, including the protection of civilians and UN staff, as well as UN premises, hospitals and public buildings that provide safe shelter from attacks, disease, deprivation and indignity; and protect prospects for a political solution that is vital to peace, security and rights for Palestinians, Israelis and the region”.
“In my 35 years working in complex emergencies, I have never written such a letter – predicting the killing of my staff and the collapse of the mandate I am expected to fulfill.”
Lazzarini detailed the “appalling” conditions being endured by the people of Gaza.
“This week, the Israeli military forces have instructed people to move further South, forcing Gaza’s population into an ever-shrinking space. Shelters are shockingly overcrowded, with high risk of epidemic illness,” Lazzarini described.
“In these overfull and unsanitary spaces, more than 700 people use a single toilet, women give birth (an average of 25 per day), and people nurse open wounds. Tens of thousands sleep in courtyards and streets. People burn plastic to stay warm,” he said.
“Nearly 90 UNRWA premises, including schools, have been hit or impacted by munitions, killing over 270 internally displaced people, many this week. In Gaza as a whole, over 16,000 people, two thirds of whom are women and children, are reported killed during bombardments.”
He said that “large swathes of Gaza are destroyed and uninhabitable”.
“The premise of UNRWA’s mandate – to provide services to Palestine Refugees until there is a political solution – is at great risk: without safe shelter and aid, civilians in Gaza risk death or will be forced to Egypt and beyond.
“Forced displacement out of Gaza may end prospects for the political solution that is intrinsic to UNRWA’s mandate, with grave risks for regional peace and security. A forced displacement beyond Palestinian land, reminiscent of the 1948 Nakba, must be prevented.”

Israel forces squeeze Gaza's main cities as UN Security Council to consider urging ceasefire,"LAST UPDATE|8 Dec 2023

ISRAELI FORCES ARE squeezing Gaza’s main cities today, two months after Hamas’s deadly attack sparked a conflict that has killed thousands, left the Palestinian territory in ruins, and triggered an extraordinary UN bid for a ceasefire.
Weeks of fighting have left 17,177 people dead in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll from Hamas which rules the coastal strip.
Vowing to destroy the Islamist movement, Israel has relentlessly bombarded Gaza and sent in tanks and ground troops since the conflict began on 7 October with unprecedented attacks by Hamas on southern Israel. Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and took hostages, 138 of whom remain captive, Israel says.
Vast areas of Gaza have been reduced to a wasteland. The UN says about 80% of the population has been displaced, facing shortages of food, fuel, water and medicine, along with the threat of disease.
Today, the Gaza health ministry reported another 40 dead in strikes near Gaza City, and dozens more in Jabalia and Khan Yunis.
AFPTV live footage showed plumes of dark smoke over the territory’s north.
The Gaza conflict has killed 91 Israeli soldiers so far. The military reported four more deaths yesterday, including the son of war cabinet minister Gadi Eisenkot.
The death toll also rose in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces shot dead six Palestinians today, the territory’s health ministry said.
An attack in Baghdad again raised fears of wider conflict. Salvoes of rockets targeted the US embassy in Baghdad’s Green Zone before dawn, US officials said.
Later today, the UN Security Council meets after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres invoked the UN Charter’s Article 99, which no one in his post has done for decades.
The article allows the secretary-general to bring to the council’s attention “any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security”.
Guterres appealed for a “humanitarian ceasefire” to prevent “a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians” and the entire Middle East.

Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen on Wednesday said Guterres’ tenure was “a danger to world peace” after he invoked Article 99.
Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said Ireland will co-sponsor the resolution on Gaza before the UN Security Council today.
As well as calling for an immediate ceasefire, Martin said the resolution will also demand protection of civilians and compliance with international law, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, and urgent humanitarian access.
This is the first attack against the US mission in Baghdad since the Israel-Hamas conflict began. Since mid-October there have been dozens of rocket or drone strikes by pro-Iran groups against American or coalition forces elsewhere in Iraq as well as in Syria.
In Gaza, fighting raged around cities in the centre and south, including Deir al-Balah, where ambulances carried numerous wounded.
“May God punish those who can see our suffering and remain calm,” said one Gazan, Rimah Mansi, who told AFP that “all those we love” were gone.
Further south, in Al-Katiba district of Khan Yunis, residents emerged to scenes of desolation after Israeli strikes, an AFP journalist said. Yesterday, the wounded arrived at the city’s Nasser hospital, where blood stained the walls.
The fighting has pushed Gazans further and further south, turning Rafah near the Egyptian border into a vast camp for many of the 1.9 million displaced.
Israel’s military released footage of naval forces firing from the Mediterranean towards what it called Hamas infrastructure on shore. Other military video showed what it described as strikes on targets in Khan Yunis.
In a statement today, the military said it had killed “numerous” militants in Khan Yunis, part of “extensive battles” in Gaza, where around 450 targets were struck yesterday.
“The troops continue to operate to locate and destroy underground tunnel shafts, weapons, and additional terror infrastructure,” it said.
Hamas has said it is battling Israeli troops “on all axes of the incursion into the Gaza Strip”.
During a phone call yesterday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, United States President Joe Biden – whose country provides billions of dollars in military aid to Israel – “emphasised the critical need to protect civilians and to separate the civilian population from Hamas”, the White House said.
Biden also called for “corridors that allow people to move safely from defined areas of hostilities”.

Israeli television stations aired footage yesterday of blindfolded men wearing only underwear, guarded by Israeli soldiers in Gaza. The army said it was investigating.
Izzat al-Rishq, of the Hamas political bureau, accused Israel of “apprehending a group of displaced Palestinian civilians” at a school and stripping them.
Yesterday, 69 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies and 61,000 litres of fuel entered Gaza from Egypt, said the UN humanitarian agency, OCHA.
This is well below the average 500 truckloads, including fuel, which entered Gaza daily before the war, it said.
Israelis remained deeply traumatised by the horror of the Hamas attack and fearful for the fate of hostages as they mark the Jewish festival of lights, Hanukkah, which began yesterday evening.
Families and supporters of the hostages still held in Gaza attended a lighting ceremony of a 138-branched menorah, representing each of the captives.
The war has also led to deadly cross-border exchanges on the Lebanese frontier.
An investigation by AFP into an 13 October strike in southern Lebanon that killed a Reuters journalist and injured six others, including two from AFP, found it involved a tank shell only used by the Israeli army in this region.
The nature of the strikes and lack of military activity in the immediate vicinity of the journalists indicate the attack was deliberate and targeted, the investigation found.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the strike merits a “war crime” investigation.
Israel’s army today said the strikes occurred in an “active combat zone” and were under review.

Heavy urban fighting rages around Gaza's biggest cities as today marks two months since 7 October attack,"HEAVY URBAN COMBAT has raged in and around Gaza’s biggest cities today as the bloodiest-ever conflict between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas entered its third month since the militants’ attack on 7 October.
An increasingly dire humanitarian situation prompted United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres toinvoke a rare measure to seek a ceasefire, sparking anger from Israel.
The death toll has soared to 17,177 according to the Gaza health ministry, and vast areas of the besieged territory have been reduced to a rubble-strewn wasteland of bombed-out or bullet-scarred buildings.
Israeli forces have encircled major urban centres in their vow to destroy Hamas over its unprecedented attack in October when militants broke through Gaza’s militarised border to kill around 1,200 people and seize hostages, 138 of whom remain captive, according to Israeli figures.
Backed by air power, tanks and armoured bulldozers, Israeli troops were fighting Hamas in Khan Yunis, the biggest city in southern Gaza, as well as in Gaza City and the nearby Jabalia district of the north.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said troops had closed in on the Khan Yunis home of Hamas’s Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar, 61, vowing “it is only a matter of time until we find him”.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
Air strikes also rained down on Rafah city in the far south, near the Egyptian border. The area has become a vast camp for many of the 1.9 million internally displaced Palestinians – 80% of Gaza’s population.

Eight more air strikes hit Rafah overnight. AFP journalists saw around 20 corpses in white body bags, including a child, at its Nasser hospital, while men gathered nearby to pray.
Mass civilian casualties in the war have sparked global concern, heightened by dire shortages caused by an Israeli siege that has seen only limited supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines enter Gaza.
Yesterday, Israel approved a “minimal” increase in fuel supplies to prevent a “humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics”.

But Guterres invoked the rarely-used Article 99 of the UN’s charter, calling on the Security Council to push for a ceasefire.
The secretary-general said he feared “public order (would) completely break down soon due to the desperate conditions” in Gaza.
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen responded that this would help Hamas and that Guterres was “a danger to world peace”.
“We, too, want this war to end,” an Israeli government spokesman said. “But it can only end in a way that ensures that Hamas can never attack our people again.”
Four more Israeli soldiers were killed, raising the toll inside Gaza to 87, said the military.
In a morning briefing, it said troops had “killed Hamas terrorists and struck dozens of terror targets” in Khan Yunis, and raided a military compound of Hamas’s Central Jabalia Battalion.
Naval forces struck Hamas military compounds and infrastructure “using precise ammunition and firing shells”, the military said.

Hamas released footage of its fighters shooting AK-47 assault rifles and grenade launchers from abandoned buildings in what it said was Gaza City, and said it was battling Israeli troops “on all axes of the incursion into the Gaza Strip”.
Hamas said it had destroyed two dozen military vehicles in Khan Yunis and in Beit Lahia in the territory’s north.
Rocket fire from inside Gaza has continued to target Israel, where the projectiles have been intercepted by air defences.
Fighting in Khan Yunis means aid distribution has virtually stopped in the city, leaving Rafah the only area “where limited aid distributions took place” yesterday, UN humanitarian agency OCHA said.
Hamas has declared a “state of famine” in northern Gaza, saying no aid had arrived there since 1 December.
Israeli rights group B’Tselem said the “miniscule amount of aid” allowed into Gaza was “tantamount to deliberately starving the population”.

A spokesman for COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, responded: “We are trying to expand the humanitarian aid, and over 60,000 tonnes of aid have entered through Rafah.”
He added that hundreds of trucks are being allowed into Gaza.

The BBCreported yesterdaythat a school in Khirbet Zanuta, a small Palestinian village south of Hebron in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, was destroyed along with most of the houses.
In a statement today, President Michael D Higgins said the “destruction of a school, part funded by Irish Aid, in the village of Khirbet Zanuta … along with the forced abandonment of the village as a whole in recent weeks following settler violence and harassment is further evidence of the appalling impact which the increase in that violence of recent weeks is having on the lives of children”.
“As Janez Lenarčič, the European Commissioner for Crisis Management, has stated, such destruction of a school is intolerable and a violation of international humanitarian law,” President Higgins said.
“It is incumbent on all of us who believe in the basics of international humanitarian law to seek to ensure that children in particular are shielded from violence and abuse and to provide them with special protection at times of conflict,” he said.
“Responding to the horrific number of children who have been killed since 7 October must inform all of our actions. We must support our international institutions and the Secretary-General of the United Nations in their plea that an end be brought to this death and destruction.”
Meanwhile, near-daily exchanges of fire across the UN-patrolled Israel-Lebanon border have continued, mainly involving Lebanon’s Hezbollah which, like Hamas, is backed by Iran.
An anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon killed a civilian in Israel, Israel’s army and medics said today.
An investigation by AFP into a strike in southern Lebanon on 13 October that killed a Reuters journalist and injured six others, including two from AFP, concluded that it involved a tank shell only used by the Israeli army in this region.
Today, watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) urged Israeli and Egyptian authorities to allow journalists to move freely over the Rafah crossing.

UN chief uses rare power to demand immediate ceasefire in Gaza,"UN SECRETARY-GENERAL ANTONIO Guterres has used a rarely exercised power, urging members of the UN Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire as the conflict in Gaza continues.
His letter to the council’s 15 members said Gaza’s humanitarian system was at risk of collapse after two months of war that has created “appalling human suffering, physical destruction and collective trauma”.
He demanded civilians be spared greater harm as he invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter.
Article 99 allows the secretary-general to inform the Security Council of matters they believe threaten international peace and security.
It came as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the heart of southern Gaza’s main city where Israel believes a suspected mastermind of the October 7 attacks is believed to be hiding.
Breaking through Hamas’s defences of Gaza’s second largest city, Israeli troops, tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers rolled into Khan Yunis, forcing already displaced civilians to flee again, witnesses said.
In his letter, Guterres said: “The international community has a responsibility to use all its influence to prevent further escalation and end this crisis.”

A short draft resolution was circulated to council members late on Wednesday by the United Arab Emirates, the Arab representative on the council.
The resolution demands “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire” and expresses “grave concern over the catastrophic situation in the Gaza Strip and the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population”.
Earlier yesterday, the 22-nation Arab Group at the UN strongly backed a ceasefire.
Palestinian UN ambassador Riyad Mansour said it is essential that the UN’s most powerful body demand a halt to the conflict.
Israel’s UN ambassador Gilad Erdan said the secretary-general invoked Article 99 to pressure Israel, accusing the UN chief of “a new moral low” and “bias against Israel”.
“The secretary-general’s call for a ceasefire is actually a call to keep Hamas’ reign of terror in Gaza,” Erdan said in a statement.
“Instead of the secretary-general explicitly pointing to Hamas’ responsibility for the situation and calling on the terrorist leaders to turn themselves in and return the hostages, thus ending the war, the secretary-general chooses to continue playing into Hamas’ hands.”

In his letter, Guterres denounced “the abhorrent acts of terror” and the killing of more than 1,200 people in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7 and the abduction of some 250 people in the attack that started the war.

He urged the immediate release of more than 130 still held captive.
But Guterres noted the worsening state of Gaza under Israel’s ongoing military action, which it says is aimed at obliterating Hamas.
More than 16,200 people have been killed, and some 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been forcibly displaced into increasingly smaller areas.
Guterres said: “Amid constant bombardment by the Israel Defence Forces, and without shelter or the essentials to survive, I expect public order to completely break down soon due to the desperate conditions, rendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible.”
A total collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza, he said, would have “potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as a whole and for peace and security in the region”.
UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that invoking Article 99 was “a very dramatic constitutional move by the secretary-general”.
The only previous mention of a prior use of Article 99 was in December 1971.
“One doesn’t invoke this article lightly,” Dujarric said.
“I think given the situation on the ground and the risk of complete collapse, not only of our humanitarian operations but of civil order, it’s something that he felt needed to be done now.”
Fierce battles
Hamas said late last night on Telegram its fighters were engaged in fierce battles against Israeli troops “on all axes of the incursion into the Gaza Strip”, as it claimed they destroyed two dozen military vehicles in Khan Yunis and Beit Lahia in the north of the territory.
Earlier, the Israeli army said it had pierced defensive lines and carried out “targeted raids in the heart of the city”, where they found and destroyed 30 tunnel shafts.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement that Israeli forces were closing in on the home of Hamas’s chief in the Gaza Strip Yahya Sinwar, with a spokesman saying it is “underground” in the Khan Yunis area.
Sinwar stands accused of being one of the masterminds of the October 7 attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities, and saw around 240 hostages taken.
Israel declared war on Hamas after the deadliest attack in its history, vowing to eradicate the group and bring home all the hostages.
Sinwar has not been seen in public during the war, and Israel has named him and the leader of Hamas’s armed wing, Mohammed Deif, as its top military targets.
But humanitarian organisations have warned the spread of the war into the south of the Gaza Strip will leave civilians who fled the north, much of which is now destroyed, with nowhere to go.

Debunked: Photo of a child actor is not proof that Palestinians are faking casualties,"
A VIDEO OF a young girl having makeup and fake blood applied, accompanied by scenes of people waving Palestinian flags, is being shared on social media alongside claims it shows Gazans are staging injuries during the war between Israel and Hamas.
This is false, and just one in a series of similar allegations; the clip is a behind-the-scenes shot from the set of a short film produced in Lebanon, which the director said was meant to artistically represent the reality of war.
“The Palestinians are fooling the international media and public opinion. DON’T FALL FOR IT,” says the caption of a since-deleted post on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, from Ofir Gendelman, the Arabic language spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister’s office.
Despite Gendelman’s deletion, the same clip has been shared on X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, in multiple languages, often accompanied by the claim that it was part of a supposed phenomenon dubbed “Pallywood” — a portmanteau of “Palestine” and “Hollywood” used to describe videos and images of purportedly staged hardships shared to garner public sympathy.
The video shows a girl on a hospital stretcher whose injuries are being attended to by medical staff. As the clip continues with what appears to be staged protests and wartime situations, the same girl is seen receiving makeup touchups and smiling — seemingly unharmed — a scene which Gendelman went on to claim proves that Palestinians are faking injuries and evacuations from Gaza during the recent violence in the territory.
On 7 October, militants with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas executed a cross-border raid in southern Israel, where about 1,200 people — mostly civilians — were killed and at least 240 more were taken back to Gaza as hostages.
According to Israeli figures, 138 hostages remain captive.
Israel vowed to “crush” Hamas and its army’s campaign has killed 17,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to a tally of reported deaths by AFP.
While the clip does depict fictional scenarios, it was not recorded by Palestinians in Gaza — the footage comes from the set of a short film shot in Lebanon, the director of the movie told AFP.
A reverse-image search using scenes from the clip circulating on social media leads to an29 October postwith the same footage from an account with the handle @rami.jardali, accompanied by a caption in Arabic that says: “Backstage of ‘The Reality’”.

This post also tagged the page of filmmakerMahmoud Ramzi, who describes himself as a Palestinian director living in Lebanon.
On 28 October, Ramzi sharedThe Reality, the completed short film on Instagram.
The movie glides between scenes including protesters with Palestinian flags, Red Crescent first responders attending to the little girl’s wounds and a violinist playing next to the hospital stretcher, all in a single shot without cuts.

The short movie is hyper stylised and is clearly not meant to fool people into believing it is footage of an unscripted event.
Ramzi told AFP that the movie was meant to illustrate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was filmed in the southern Lebanese town of Sidon, not Gaza. He expressed “his anger” that footage from the film set was misappropriated and has shared multiple fact-checks refuting the “Pallywood” narrative.
Razmi has also posted a more recentshort filmto his account, which also shows hyper-stylised depictions of the aftermath of violence in Gaza.
False accusations of staging scenes of suffering with so-called “crisis actors” was a trend seen before with mass shootings in the US and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but experts have seen these types of claims skyrocket during the Israel-Hamas war.
Gendelman is not the first Israeli government account toshare claimsof faked wartime hardships in Gaza.
The Journalhas previouslydebunked claimsthat a photo of a person in a bodybag checking their phone was evidence that Palestinians were faking deaths. The photo was actually of a child in Thailand dressed a Halloween costume.

“It is incumbent on all of us who believe in the basics of international humanitarian law to seek to ensure that children in particular are shielded from violence and abuse and to provide them with special protection at times of conflict,” he said.
“Responding to the horrific number of children who have been killed since 7 October must inform all of our actions. We must support our international institutions and the Secretary-General of the United Nations in their plea that an end be brought to this death and destruction.”
Meanwhile, near-daily exchanges of fire across the UN-patrolled Israel-Lebanon border have continued, mainly involving Lebanon’s Hezbollah which, like Hamas, is backed by Iran.
An anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon killed a civilian in Israel, Israel’s army and medics said today.
An investigation by AFP into a strike in southern Lebanon on 13 October that killed a Reuters journalist and injured six others, including two from AFP, concluded that it involved a tank shell only used by the Israeli army in this region.
Today, watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) urged Israeli and Egyptian authorities to allow journalists to move freely over the Rafah crossing.

UN chief uses rare power to demand immediate ceasefire in Gaza,"UN SECRETARY-GENERAL ANTONIO Guterres has used a rarely exercised power, urging members of the UN Security Council to demand an immediate humanitarian ceasefire as the conflict in Gaza continues.
His letter to the council’s 15 members said Gaza’s humanitarian system was at risk of collapse after two months of war that has created “appalling human suffering, physical destruction and collective trauma”.
He demanded civilians be spared greater harm as he invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter.
Article 99 allows the secretary-general to inform the Security Council of matters they believe threaten international peace and security.
It came as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the heart of southern Gaza’s main city where Israel believes a suspected mastermind of the October 7 attacks is believed to be hiding.
Breaking through Hamas’s defences of Gaza’s second largest city, Israeli troops, tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers rolled into Khan Yunis, forcing already displaced civilians to flee again, witnesses said.
In his letter, Guterres said: “The international community has a responsibility to use all its influence to prevent further escalation and end this crisis.”

A short draft resolution was circulated to council members late on Wednesday by the United Arab Emirates, the Arab representative on the council.
The resolution demands “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire” and expresses “grave concern over the catastrophic situation in the Gaza Strip and the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population”.
Earlier yesterday, the 22-nation Arab Group at the UN strongly backed a ceasefire.
Palestinian UN ambassador Riyad Mansour said it is essential that the UN’s most powerful body demand a halt to the conflict.
Israel’s UN ambassador Gilad Erdan said the secretary-general invoked Article 99 to pressure Israel, accusing the UN chief of “a new moral low” and “bias against Israel”.
“The secretary-general’s call for a ceasefire is actually a call to keep Hamas’ reign of terror in Gaza,” Erdan said in a statement.
“Instead of the secretary-general explicitly pointing to Hamas’ responsibility for the situation and calling on the terrorist leaders to turn themselves in and return the hostages, thus ending the war, the secretary-general chooses to continue playing into Hamas’ hands.”

In his letter, Guterres denounced “the abhorrent acts of terror” and the killing of more than 1,200 people in Israel by Hamas militants on October 7 and the abduction of some 250 people in the attack that started the war.

He urged the immediate release of more than 130 still held captive.
But Guterres noted the worsening state of Gaza under Israel’s ongoing military action, which it says is aimed at obliterating Hamas.
More than 16,200 people have been killed, and some 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been forcibly displaced into increasingly smaller areas.
Guterres said: “Amid constant bombardment by the Israel Defence Forces, and without shelter or the essentials to survive, I expect public order to completely break down soon due to the desperate conditions, rendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible.”
A total collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza, he said, would have “potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as a whole and for peace and security in the region”.
UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that invoking Article 99 was “a very dramatic constitutional move by the secretary-general”.
The only previous mention of a prior use of Article 99 was in December 1971.
“One doesn’t invoke this article lightly,” Dujarric said.
“I think given the situation on the ground and the risk of complete collapse, not only of our humanitarian operations but of civil order, it’s something that he felt needed to be done now.”
Fierce battles
Hamas said late last night on Telegram its fighters were engaged in fierce battles against Israeli troops “on all axes of the incursion into the Gaza Strip”, as it claimed they destroyed two dozen military vehicles in Khan Yunis and Beit Lahia in the north of the territory.
Earlier, the Israeli army said it had pierced defensive lines and carried out “targeted raids in the heart of the city”, where they found and destroyed 30 tunnel shafts.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement that Israeli forces were closing in on the home of Hamas’s chief in the Gaza Strip Yahya Sinwar, with a spokesman saying it is “underground” in the Khan Yunis area.
Sinwar stands accused of being one of the masterminds of the October 7 attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities, and saw around 240 hostages taken.
Israel declared war on Hamas after the deadliest attack in its history, vowing to eradicate the group and bring home all the hostages.
Sinwar has not been seen in public during the war, and Israel has named him and the leader of Hamas’s armed wing, Mohammed Deif, as its top military targets.
But humanitarian organisations have warned the spread of the war into the south of the Gaza Strip will leave civilians who fled the north, much of which is now destroyed, with nowhere to go.

Taoiseach: 'EU far too passive for far too long over Middle East conflict',"THE EU HAS been “far too passive for far too long” in its efforts to secure a lasting peace settlement in the Middle East, the Taoiseach has said.
Leo Varadkar said he will use next week’s meeting of the European Council to urge fellow EU leaders to agree a joint call for a renewed ceasefire and for them to press harder for the “two-state solution” peace model for Israel and Palestine.
His comments came as Israel continued its assault on the Gaza Strip following Hamas’s 7 October attacks on Israeli civilians.
Labour leader Ivana Bacik insisted Ireland should be doing more to ramp up pressure on Israel to stop its bombardment.
“We want to see a stronger response from Ireland, pushing at EU level to ensure that other EU member states can be brought on board to seek that crucial goal of a permanent humanitarian ceasefire,” said Bacik.
Varadkar told the Dáil he will use his role as Taoiseach at the European Council next week to press for the European Union to adopt wording calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, and calling for the European Union in particular “to take a much more active role in pushing for a two-state solution and Palestinian statehood”.
He said the “European Union has been far too passive for far too long when it comes to this conflict”.

Bacik said it would be a “brave and bold” step for Ireland to officially recognise Palestine as a state in his own right.
Varadkar said such a move would be ineffectual if Ireland acted alone.
“We don’t believe that the best way to do it is unilaterally – that will be dismissed,” he said.
“It will be ineffectual and will be seen as an outlier acting unilaterally at a European level.
“What we would like to do is do it as part of a group of European countries, and I think that will be a more significant statement.
“And we don’t just want it to be a statement – we want it to be part perhaps of an agreement to end the violence that’s happening at the moment and to put in place a new administration in Gaza for the day after.
“And that’s the kind of conversation that we’re having at the moment, for example with Spain, which has a similar view to ours, and some other countries as well.”

US Senate blocks international aid to Israel and Ukraine to push for stronger border control,"MEMBERS OF THE American Republican party in the US Senate blocked the advance of tens of billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine and Israel last night.
President Joe Biden has called the move “stunning” and dangerous.
US Congress failed to pass a $110 billion dollar (€102 billion) package of wartime funding for Ukraine and Israel as well as other national security priorities, a move Senate Republicans had threatened to do all week.
The US president warned the move by Republican senators could have dire consequences for Kyiv and may be seen as a gift by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“They’re willing to literally kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield and damage our national security in the process,” Biden said.
Biden, however, signalled that he is open to working on the border policy changes Republican politicians want to see first.
He stressed that he is willing to “make significant compromises on the border” if that is what it takes to get the package through US Congress.
Republicans have argued the record numbers of migrants crossing the southern border pose a security threat because border authorities cannot adequately screen them.
They also say they cannot justify to their constituents sending billions of dollars to other countries while failing to address the border at home.

So far, senators have agreed on raising the initial standard for migrants to enter the asylum system.
But they have been at odds over placing limitations on humanitarian parole, a programme that allows the executive branch to admit migrants without action from Congress temporarily.
“We need to fix the broken border system. It is broken,” the president said, adding that he is “ready to change policy as well”.
He did not name specific policy proposals and accused Republicans of wanting a political issue more than bipartisan compromise.
Oklahoma Republican senator James Lankford, who has been leading Senate negotiations over border policy, said it seemed like the president is “ready to be able to sit down and talk”.
Senators of both parties acknowledged they would need to move quickly if a deal was to be struck as US Congress is scheduled to be in Washington for just a handful more days before the end of the year.
“When deadlines come, everybody’s undivided attention is there, and we realise:’ OK. Now it’s time to actually solve this,’” Lankford said.
Democrats involved in the negotiations also said a direct hand from the president, as well as from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, could be helpful.
“This kind of thorny, difficult problem is exactly what Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell have worked on before. And we could use their help and their leadership on this,” said Democratic Senator Michael Bennet, another negotiator.
The White House, meanwhile, has sounded the alarm about what would happen if the Senate does not approve more international aid funding soon, adding Ukraine’s military would be stalled or even overrun.","8.14am, 7 Dec 2023",,

'Deepening horror' condemned as Israel carries out attacks in Gaza's second-largest city,"LAST UPDATE|6 Dec 2023

ISRAELI FORCES HAVE battled Hamas militants in Gaza’s main southern city, leading to “deepening horror” for civilians, the UN has said, after nearly two months of war sparked by deadly attacks on Israel.
Israeli troops, tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers have rolled into Khan Yunis, Gaza’s second-largest city, forcing already displaced civilians to flee again, witnesses told AFP.
The military wing of Hamas reported fighting with Israeli forces east of the southern city.
“We are devastated,” said local resident Amal Mahdi who survived an overnight Israeli strike on Khan Yunis. “We need someone to find us a solution so we can get out of this situation.”
Much of northern Gaza has already been reduced to rubble by fierce fighting and bombardment, displacing 1.9 million people according to UN figures.
With Israel now focusing on the south, the streets of Khan Yunis were almost empty early today as residents sought shelter from shelling and artillery fire, AFP journalists reported, while the dead and wounded continued to pour into the city’s hospitals.
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s 7 October attacks that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities, and saw around 240 hostages taken.
The latest toll from the Hamas government’s media office said 16,248 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, had been killed.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
“We, too, want this war to end,” Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told reporters, “But it can only end in a way that ensures that Hamas can never attack our people again.”

Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and free 138 hostages still held in Gaza after scores were released during a short-lived truce.

But mass casualties in Gaza have sparked global concern, heightened by dire shortages caused by an Israeli siege that has seen only limited supplies of food, water, fuel and medicines enter.
“The entire north of the Gaza Strip is left without health services,” said Munir al-Bursh, director of the Gaza health ministry.
With mediation efforts seemingly stalled since the collapse of a truce on Friday, the UN human rights chief pleaded for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages.
“Palestinians in Gaza are living in utter, deepening horror,” Volker Turk told a news conference.
“Civilians in Gaza continue to be relentlessly bombarded by Israel and collectively punished … I call for an urgent cessation of hostilities,” he said.
The Israeli army said today it had struck about 250 targets in Gaza over the past 24 hours and that troops had found a major arms depot “in the heart of a civilian population”.
“One of the largest weapons depots in the Gaza Strip was found near a clinic and school” in an undisclosed location in northern Gaza, it said.
“The depot contained hundreds of RPG missiles and launchers of various types, dozens of anti-tank missiles,” explosives and drones, the statement added.
Sources in Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group, told AFP their fighters were battling Israeli troops early today in a bid to prevent them from breaking into Khan Yunis.
The Hamas media office said dozens were killed and injured in heavy strikes east of the city.

Many civilians fled to Khan Yunis when Israel ordered them to evacuate the north of the densely populated Gaza Strip earlier in the offensive.
Hassan al-Qadi, a Khan Yunis resident displaced to Rafah, said “the whole city is suffering from destruction and relentless shelling”.
“Many are homeless and some are searching for their missing children,” he said.

International aid groups have condemned the succession of orders to flee from one area to another, saying civilians were running out of options.
Israel’s army has published a map it said was intended to enable Gazans to “evacuate from specific places for their safety if required”.
But the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, said it was “not possible” to create safe zones in a tiny territory with some 2.4 million people.
The UN has faced criticism over its alleged lacklustre response to reports of sexual violence by Hamas during the 7 October attack, which the Palestinian group has dismissed as “unfounded lies”.
Its rights chief, Turk, voiced deep concern today over the reports, saying “these are very, very serious allegations and they need to be investigated, they need to be properly documented”.
“Justice must be served for the victims,” he added.
UNICEF head Catherine Russell said “survivors must be heard, supported, and provided with care. Allegations must be fully investigated”.
Fighting resumed after the collapse on Friday of a Qatar-mediated truce that saw scores of Israeli and other hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
The conflict has sparked fears of a wider regional conflict, with near-daily exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah across Israel’s border with Lebanon and a surge of deadly violence in the occupied West Bank.
Today, Israel said a missile fired at the Red Sea town of Eilat “was successfully intercepted” after sirens blared in the resort.
In the West Bank, Israeli troops raided the northern Faraa refugee camp early Wednesday, sparking clashes that killed two people, one of them aged 16, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
Palestinian authorities say more than 250 Palestinians have been killed during the current conflict by Israeli fire or settler attacks in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967.

UN warns Gaza to become 'even more hellish' as Israeli troops continue to push south,"LAST UPDATE|5 Dec 2023

ISRAELI FORCES HAVE battled Hamas militants in southern Gaza today, prompting a UN warning of an “even more hellish scenario” as fighting pushes civilians into a steadily shrinking area of the besieged territory.
After an air and ground assault that has displaced hundreds of thousands and reduced much of northern Gaza to rubble, Israel has now sent tanks and troops into the south as well, including the second-largest city Khan Yunis.
Israel says it aims to destroy Hamas and free hostages taken in unprecedented 7 October cross-border attacks.
“We are in the heart of Jabalia, in the heart of Shejaiya (in northern Gaza), and now also in the heart of Khan Yunis,” the army’s Southern Command chief Major General Yaron Finkelman said on what he called “the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation” in late October.
Israeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen near Khan Yunis, forcing already displaced civilians to pack up and flee again, witnesses told AFP.
The Gaza health ministry said 25 people died in a strike on a school where displaced people were sheltering.
Ambulances, trucks and other vehicles delivered bloodied, dust-covered casualties to Khan Yunis’s Nasser hospital, including children.
With Hamas leaders still at large and 138 hostages still in militant hands according to Israel, army chief Herzi Halevi said “military pressure … is severely damaging Hamas” and helping the push to free captives.
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s 7 October attacks that it says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw around 240 hostages taken.

The latest toll from the Hamas-run government media office said 16,248 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, had been killed.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
“The situation is getting worse by the hour,” said Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s representative in the Palestinian territories, urging “a sustained ceasefire” after almost two months of war.
“We are close by humanity’s darkest hour,” Peeperkorn told reporters via video link from Rafah in southern Gaza.

International aid organisations have warned that civilians in the densely populated Strip are running out of places to flee to.
“Nowhere is safe in Gaza and there is nowhere left to go,” said Lynn Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories.
“If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond,” Hastings said in a statement.
The Norwegian Refugee Council aid group said the violence in Gaza “now ranks amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age”.
“Countries supporting Israel with arms must understand that these civilian deaths will be a permanent stain on their reputation,” the organisation’s chief Jen Egeland said in a statement, also warning of the dire public health ramifications of the rainy season.
Their belongings piled onto donkey carts, battered vehicles and even camels, Gazans headed south to try to escape the expanding Israeli offensive.

An estimated 1.8 million people are displaced in Gaza – roughly three-quarters of the population, according to UN figures.
An Israeli order for people to move from Khan Yunis to the southern city of Rafah “created panic, fear and anxiety”, according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
People were being pushed into an area that is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip, with roads to the south clogged, he said.
In northern Gaza, the military said it had encircled the Jabalia refugee camp and also raided a Hamas Internal Security Forces command and control centre.
It said the number of Israeli soldiers killed since the war began had risen to 82.
And in Israel, sirens blared in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv warning of incoming rocket fire.
US President Joe Biden called for the condemnation of “sexual violence” committed by Hamas, after allegations of rape during the 7 October attacks, which the militant group denies.
The United States has also cautioned Israel to do more to avert civilian casualties.
And US aid chief Samantha Power announced $21 million in new assistance for Gazans during a visit to neighbouring Egypt, including hygiene shelter and food supplies.

Marking the 60th day since the hostages were taken, a group of former captives met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
“I heard heartbreaking stories, of hunger and thirst, of children whispering in fear,” Netanyahu told reporters.
On the fighting, he hailed the “immense power” of the military campaign, saying “the earth shook in Khan Yunis and Jabalia”.
An Israeli official claimed Hamas drugged hostages with sedatives so they appeared “calm and happy” when released.
Hamas has ruled out further releases until a permanent ceasefire is agreed.
Qatar’s ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, said his country was “constantly working to renew” the truce and denounced what he called “shameful” international inaction over the war.
The conflict has sparked fears of a wider regional conflict, with frequent exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah across Israel’s border with Lebanon.
The occupied West Bank has also seen a surge in violence.
The killing of a 25-year-old, Mohammed Youssef Manasra, in an Israeli raid on Qalandia refugee camp added to more than 250 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since October, according to Palestinian authorities.
Journalists have paid a heavy price too, with the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists saying it had documented 63 media workers killed in the war: 56 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese.

Documents retrieved from Hamas by Israel reveal 7 October attacks were planned years in advance,"
DIGITAL DEVICES AND documents retrieved from Hamas militants afterthe 7 October attackreveal years of planning and a very high level of “detail and readiness”, Israeli intelligence officers say.
The material taken from dead or captured Palestinian gunmen show detailed plans for an assault that aimed to cause “such a shock as to break people’s spirit”, one officer told reporters.
Data from mobile phones, computers, tablets, GPS devices, GoPro cameras, maps and notebooks “show years of planning on how to attack bases and kibbutzim,” said another intelligence officer, both speaking on condition of anonymity.
On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas and allied Gaza militants stormed into southern Israel,killing more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages according to Israeli officials.
In response, Israelvowed to destroy Hamas with relentless bombardmentand a ground offensive, killing around 15,900 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
To analyse the material, Israel has reactivated a military intelligence unit called Amshat to plough through the numerous Arabic documents and decipher millions of pieces of electronic data.
Together, they constitute “a battle plan,” one officer said. “The level of detail and of readiness are the biggest surprise.”
The Amshat unit was founded after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war when Israel was blindsided by Egyptian and Syrian attacks and has been reactivated several times since.
The New York Times reported on 1 December that more than a year ago Israeli intelligence had obtained a Hamas plan giving step-by-step details of an attack similar to October 7, but which was judged to be an “imaginary” scenario.
Detailed tactical plans were discovered on computers, including objectives, names of the units involved and missions assigned to each of them, together with precise operational details, timings and a list of weapons needed.
There was a detailed hand drawing of the military outpost of Nahal Oz, which Hamas seized.
On the bodies of dead fighters were found satellite photos and precise plans of two of the attacked kibbutzim.
One intelligence officer said he was sure that kibbutz details came from the inside, from either Palestinian workers or Arab Israelis.

“For the base we don’t know,” the officer said. “But it cannot be by open source.”
The media briefing was also told that “part of the training was on how to take hostages” and that “checklists” and “phrase books” had been found.
The checklist seen by AFP tells militants to cover the eyes and tie the hands of all adult hostages.
It adds that the hostage-takers should “kill those who cause problems or seek to escape”.
A conversation guide shown to AFP includes around 50 expressions in Hebrew transcribed phonetically, including “shut up”, “don’t move”, “hands in the air” and “lie down”.
Surprisingly, some documents found were unrelated to the October 7 attack, including several deemed to be of high military value.
“Some of the Hamas fighters were kept in the dark and did not know what would happen,” said one officer.
“A lot of them came with things that were not relevant to the raid, some with cars used on a daily basis,” said the other.
In the mountain of information, one intelligence officer said, “some things were known, some are new … We have to find the gold nugget”.
One officer said that a detailed map of southern Gaza had been found, identifying previously unknown Hamas military installations.
Journalists were also told that Amshat had obtained images of tunnels in Gaza, without being told how these were obtained.
The images showed long corridors, reinforced by concrete and metal, wide and high enough for a vehicle to pass through.
One intelligence officer said they would “not be surprised” if there were more than 500 kilometres of deep, interlacing tunnels in total.
“All of Gaza Strip is a matrix of tunnels… Imagine how many hostages you can put inside.”

Leo Varadkar said he will use next week’s meeting of the European Council to urge fellow EU leaders to agree a joint call for a renewed ceasefire and for them to press harder for the “two-state solution” peace model for Israel and Palestine.
His comments came as Israel continued its assault on the Gaza Strip following Hamas’s 7 October attacks on Israeli civilians.
Labour leader Ivana Bacik insisted Ireland should be doing more to ramp up pressure on Israel to stop its bombardment.
“We want to see a stronger response from Ireland, pushing at EU level to ensure that other EU member states can be brought on board to seek that crucial goal of a permanent humanitarian ceasefire,” said Bacik.
Varadkar told the Dáil he will use his role as Taoiseach at the European Council next week to press for the European Union to adopt wording calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, and calling for the European Union in particular “to take a much more active role in pushing for a two-state solution and Palestinian statehood”.
He said the “European Union has been far too passive for far too long when it comes to this conflict”.

Bacik said it would be a “brave and bold” step for Ireland to officially recognise Palestine as a state in his own right.
Varadkar said such a move would be ineffectual if Ireland acted alone.
“We don’t believe that the best way to do it is unilaterally – that will be dismissed,” he said.
“It will be ineffectual and will be seen as an outlier acting unilaterally at a European level.
“What we would like to do is do it as part of a group of European countries, and I think that will be a more significant statement.
“And we don’t just want it to be a statement – we want it to be part perhaps of an agreement to end the violence that’s happening at the moment and to put in place a new administration in Gaza for the day after.
“And that’s the kind of conversation that we’re having at the moment, for example with Spain, which has a similar view to ours, and some other countries as well.”

UN warns Gaza to become 'even more hellish' as Israeli troops continue to push south,"LAST UPDATE|5 Dec 2023

ISRAELI FORCES HAVE battled Hamas militants in southern Gaza today, prompting a UN warning of an “even more hellish scenario” as fighting pushes civilians into a steadily shrinking area of the besieged territory.
After an air and ground assault that has displaced hundreds of thousands and reduced much of northern Gaza to rubble, Israel has now sent tanks and troops into the south as well, including the second-largest city Khan Yunis.
Israel says it aims to destroy Hamas and free hostages taken in unprecedented 7 October cross-border attacks.
“We are in the heart of Jabalia, in the heart of Shejaiya (in northern Gaza), and now also in the heart of Khan Yunis,” the army’s Southern Command chief Major General Yaron Finkelman said on what he called “the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation” in late October.
Israeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen near Khan Yunis, forcing already displaced civilians to pack up and flee again, witnesses told AFP.
The Gaza health ministry said 25 people died in a strike on a school where displaced people were sheltering.
Ambulances, trucks and other vehicles delivered bloodied, dust-covered casualties to Khan Yunis’s Nasser hospital, including children.
With Hamas leaders still at large and 138 hostages still in militant hands according to Israel, army chief Herzi Halevi said “military pressure … is severely damaging Hamas” and helping the push to free captives.
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s 7 October attacks that it says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw around 240 hostages taken.

The latest toll from the Hamas-run government media office said 16,248 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, had been killed.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
“The situation is getting worse by the hour,” said Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s representative in the Palestinian territories, urging “a sustained ceasefire” after almost two months of war.
“We are close by humanity’s darkest hour,” Peeperkorn told reporters via video link from Rafah in southern Gaza.

International aid organisations have warned that civilians in the densely populated Strip are running out of places to flee to.
“Nowhere is safe in Gaza and there is nowhere left to go,” said Lynn Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories.
“If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond,” Hastings said in a statement.
The Norwegian Refugee Council aid group said the violence in Gaza “now ranks amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age”.
“Countries supporting Israel with arms must understand that these civilian deaths will be a permanent stain on their reputation,” the organisation’s chief Jen Egeland said in a statement, also warning of the dire public health ramifications of the rainy season.
Their belongings piled onto donkey carts, battered vehicles and even camels, Gazans headed south to try to escape the expanding Israeli offensive.

An estimated 1.8 million people are displaced in Gaza – roughly three-quarters of the population, according to UN figures.
An Israeli order for people to move from Khan Yunis to the southern city of Rafah “created panic, fear and anxiety”, according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
People were being pushed into an area that is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip, with roads to the south clogged, he said.
In northern Gaza, the military said it had encircled the Jabalia refugee camp and also raided a Hamas Internal Security Forces command and control centre.
It said the number of Israeli soldiers killed since the war began had risen to 82.
And in Israel, sirens blared in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv warning of incoming rocket fire.
US President Joe Biden called for the condemnation of “sexual violence” committed by Hamas, after allegations of rape during the 7 October attacks, which the militant group denies.
The United States has also cautioned Israel to do more to avert civilian casualties.
And US aid chief Samantha Power announced $21 million in new assistance for Gazans during a visit to neighbouring Egypt, including hygiene shelter and food supplies.

Israel yesterday said it was not seeking to force Palestinian civilians to permanently leave their homes, and was seeking support from aid groups to provide shelter in a tiny coastal area of Gaza named Al-Mawasi.
Fighting has resumed after the collapse on Friday of a Qatar-mediated truce that saw scores of Israeli and other hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.

Marking the 60th day since the hostages were taken, a group of former captives met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
“I heard heartbreaking stories, of hunger and thirst, of children whispering in fear,” Netanyahu told reporters.
On the fighting, he hailed the “immense power” of the military campaign, saying “the earth shook in Khan Yunis and Jabalia”.
An Israeli official claimed Hamas drugged hostages with sedatives so they appeared “calm and happy” when released.
Hamas has ruled out further releases until a permanent ceasefire is agreed.
Qatar’s ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, said his country was “constantly working to renew” the truce and denounced what he called “shameful” international inaction over the war.
The conflict has sparked fears of a wider regional conflict, with frequent exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah across Israel’s border with Lebanon.
The occupied West Bank has also seen a surge in violence.
The killing of a 25-year-old, Mohammed Youssef Manasra, in an Israeli raid on Qalandia refugee camp added to more than 250 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since October, according to Palestinian authorities.
Journalists have paid a heavy price too, with the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists saying it had documented 63 media workers killed in the war: 56 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese.

International concern deepens over civilian death toll as Israel expands offensive in Gaza,"LAST UPDATE|4 Dec 2023
ISRAEL’S ARMY HAS sent dozens of tanks into southern Gaza as part of expanded, “aggressive” action against Hamas and its allies in the besieged territory, despite global concern over mounting civilian deaths.
Weeks after Israel deployed ground forces in the north of the Gaza Strip, the army has been air-dropping leaflets in parts of the south, telling Palestinians to flee to other areas.
Israel has vowed to crush Hamas in retaliation for the militant group’s unprecedented 7 October attacks that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw around 240 hostages taken, according to Israeli authorities.
Gaza’s health ministry says nearly 15,900 people have been killed in the territory, about 70% of them women and children, during Israel’s relentless air, artillery and naval bombardments alongside its ground campaign.
Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said the resumption of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza is “unconscionable”.
“I said before the resumption of the war that it was unconscionable that the war would resume and I believe that,” he said.
“We know from the bombardment of north Gaza that the protection of civilian life was not prioritised, and far too many innocent men, women and children were killed and are now being killed in southern Gaza as a result of this bombardment – and I condemn that, that is wrong.”
Speaking to reporters in Dublin, Martin added: “We’ll continue to work with all of the parties – Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and others – to first of all get hostages out, to get remaining civilians out, but more critically to get the war ended.
“And I think there is a lot of pressure on and that pressure will continue.”
Tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen today near the southern city of Khan Yunis, which is packed with internally displaced Palestinians, witnesses told AFP.
At the crowded entrance to the city’s Nasser hospital, ambulances and private cars delivered dazed, bloodied and dust-covered survivors.
Hoping to flee the bombardments, others continued to move further south, their belongings piled onto donkey carts, battered vehicles and even camels, but air strikes have followed them right to the southern border.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday that the Israeli army had told the UN health agency to empty an aid warehouse in southern Gaza before ground operations in the area made it unusable.
“Today, WHO received notification from the Israel Defense Forces that we should remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours, as ground operations will put it beyond use,” Tedros wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

“We appeal to Israel to withdraw the order, and take every possible measure to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and humanitarian facilities,” he wrote.
Amin Abu Hawli, 59, said Israeli vehicles were 2km inside Gaza in the village of al-Qarara, while Moaz Mohammed, 34, said Israeli tanks were moving down the strip’s main north-south highway, the Salah al-Din road.
The military was trying to cut the road between Deir al-Balah in central Gaza and Khan Yunis, “firing bullets and tank shells at cars and people trying to move through the area,” Mohammed said.
The army said it was taking “aggressive” action against “Hamas and other terrorist organisations” in Khan Yunis, warning that the Salah al-Din road in the north and east of the city “constitutes a battlefield”.
Three more Israeli soldiers were killed in clashes in the northern Gaza Strip, raising the number of troop deaths there to 75, the army said today.
Full-scale fighting resumed on Friday after the collapse of a week-long truce brokered by Qatar with support from the United States and Egypt, during which 80 Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
Nine-year-old Irish-Israeli Emily Hand wasreleased last weekafter being heldhostage by Hamas in Gazafor almost 50 days.
More than two dozen Thai and other captives were also released from Gaza.
With at least 137 hostages still held in Gaza, according to the Israeli military, Hamas has ruled out more releases until a permanent ceasefire is agreed.
More air strikes also hit northern Gaza where Hamas’s armed wing reported clashes with Israeli tanks.
Rocket salvos were again fired from Gaza towards Israeli territory.
International Committee of the Red Cross president Mirjana Spoljaric, visiting Gaza, described the suffering as “intolerable”.
Conditions worsened further today with all mobile and telephone services across Gaza severed “due to the cut-off of main fibre routes from the Israeli side”, the PalTel company said.
Gazans were already short of food, water and other essentials including fuel.
Israel’s ally the United States has asked Israel to let more fuel in, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said today.
The US intensified calls for the protection of Gaza’s civilians, and Miller voiced guarded praise for Israeli tactics as its campaign expands in the south.
“We’ve seen a much more targeted request for evacuations” than in the earlier campaign in the north, he said.

“So that is an improvement on what’s happened before.”

Israel said that it was not seeking to force Palestinian civilians to permanently leave their homes.
“We have asked civilians to evacuate the battlefield and we have provided a designated humanitarian zone inside the Gaza Strip,” military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said, referring to a tiny coastal area of the territory named Al-Mawasi.
Any suggestion of Palestinian dispersal is highly contentious in the Arab world as the war that led to Israel’s creation 75 years ago gave rise to the exodus or forced displacement of 760,000 Palestinians.
At the United Nations today, Israel and Palestinian representatives traded accusations of “genocide” over the war, both sides demanding an international response.
With fears of a wider regional conflagration, a United States destroyer shot down multiple drones over the Red Sea while assisting commercial ships yesterday, according to the US Central Command.
Yemen’s Huthi rebels, which like Hamas are backed by Iran, said they had targeted two of the ships.
On Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, the Israeli army said it had launched artillery strikes in response to cross-border fire, and its fighter jets hit targets linked to Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
The Israel-occupied West Bank has also seen a surge in violence, with more than 250 Palestinians killed there since the war began, according to Palestinian authorities.
The Palestinian Authority’s health ministry said Monday two more were shot dead in an Israeli raid on the town of Qalqilya, and a third in Qalandia refugee camp.
Despite the war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial, suspended when the war began, resumed today.
He is accused of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, which he denies.

"Richard Boyd Barrett defends remarks labelling Israel a ‘filthy, racist regime’","PEOPLE BEFORE PROFIT TD Richard Boyd Barrett has refused to apologise for comments he made labelling Israel a “psychopath” State and a “filthy, apartheid, racist regime”.
Boyd Barrett made the comments on Saturday at a march on the Dáil expressing solidarity with Palestine and calling for the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland to be expelled.
During his comments, Boyd Barrett said: “This should be a moment of truth for people who have lied to us or are lying to themselves, that a State that is capable of doing this is a psychopath.”
He also described the Israeli State as a “criminal, a barbarian, and a mass murderer.”
Boyd Barrett also said you can “only make peace with human beings, with people who have some humanity, you cannot make peace with a psychopath, with a mass murderer, with a savage, and that is what the State of Israel is”.
He also claimed it was “shameful” that Tánaiste Micheál Martin “paraded around Israel with (Israel Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and his mass murderers”.
Martin went on an official trip to Israel last monthand visited the sites attacked by Hamas on 7 October, including the town of Sderot where 45 people were killed and Kibbutz Be’eri, a farming community where around 130 people were killed.
Boyd Barrett added that the “filthy, apartheid, racist, colonial-settler regime that is Israel” needs to be dismantled.

Boyd Barrett called for an “intifada”, which is an Arabic term for rebellion or uprising.
In a statement on X, formerly Twitter, the Embassy of Israel in Ireland said Boyd Barrett had “engaged in actions promoting antisemitism and endorsing violence against the people of the Jewish nation”.
The statement added: “By any standard, his words constituted hate speech and incitement, the delegitimization of Israel and an explicit call for intifada (uprising).

“One would expect that people claiming to defend human rights would distance themselves from the sadistic and barbaric massacre, mass rape and torture of 7 October by terror organisation Hamas.”
When asked by reporters today if he would withdraw his remarks, Boyd Barrett said wouldn’t be issuing an apology.
“I abhor every form of racism and antisemitism,” said Boyd Barrett.
“It is precisely because I oppose all forms of racism – I have a long record of opposing racism and antisemitism – that I think the regime of apartheid that Israel is defending is an absolutely disgusting, murderous, racist system.”
He added: “In the same way as apartheid South Africa was dismantled, I believe this apartheid regime in Israel – that is capable of the sorts of crimes we have seen perpetrated against the people of Gaza – needs to be dismantled, and I make no apologies for it.
“Racism is a filthy ideology and the apartheid system in Israel, just like the apartheid regime in South Africa, is a filthy racist regime.”

Documents retrieved from Hamas by Israel reveal 7 October attacks were planned years in advance,"
DIGITAL DEVICES AND documents retrieved from Hamas militants afterthe 7 October attackreveal years of planning and a very high level of “detail and readiness”, Israeli intelligence officers say.
The material taken from dead or captured Palestinian gunmen show detailed plans for an assault that aimed to cause “such a shock as to break people’s spirit”, one officer told reporters.
Data from mobile phones, computers, tablets, GPS devices, GoPro cameras, maps and notebooks “show years of planning on how to attack bases and kibbutzim,” said another intelligence officer, both speaking on condition of anonymity.
On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas and allied Gaza militants stormed into southern Israel,killing more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages according to Israeli officials.
In response, Israelvowed to destroy Hamas with relentless bombardmentand a ground offensive, killing around 15,900 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
To analyse the material, Israel has reactivated a military intelligence unit called Amshat to plough through the numerous Arabic documents and decipher millions of pieces of electronic data.
Together, they constitute “a battle plan,” one officer said. “The level of detail and of readiness are the biggest surprise.”
The Amshat unit was founded after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war when Israel was blindsided by Egyptian and Syrian attacks and has been reactivated several times since.
The New York Times reported on 1 December that more than a year ago Israeli intelligence had obtained a Hamas plan giving step-by-step details of an attack similar to October 7, but which was judged to be an “imaginary” scenario.
Detailed tactical plans were discovered on computers, including objectives, names of the units involved and missions assigned to each of them, together with precise operational details, timings and a list of weapons needed.
There was a detailed hand drawing of the military outpost of Nahal Oz, which Hamas seized.
On the bodies of dead fighters were found satellite photos and precise plans of two of the attacked kibbutzim.
One intelligence officer said he was sure that kibbutz details came from the inside, from either Palestinian workers or Arab Israelis.

“For the base we don’t know,” the officer said. “But it cannot be by open source.”
The media briefing was also told that “part of the training was on how to take hostages” and that “checklists” and “phrase books” had been found.
The checklist seen by AFP tells militants to cover the eyes and tie the hands of all adult hostages.
It adds that the hostage-takers should “kill those who cause problems or seek to escape”.
A conversation guide shown to AFP includes around 50 expressions in Hebrew transcribed phonetically, including “shut up”, “don’t move”, “hands in the air” and “lie down”.
Surprisingly, some documents found were unrelated to the October 7 attack, including several deemed to be of high military value.
“Some of the Hamas fighters were kept in the dark and did not know what would happen,” said one officer.
“A lot of them came with things that were not relevant to the raid, some with cars used on a daily basis,” said the other.
In the mountain of information, one intelligence officer said, “some things were known, some are new … We have to find the gold nugget”.
One officer said that a detailed map of southern Gaza had been found, identifying previously unknown Hamas military installations.
Journalists were also told that Amshat had obtained images of tunnels in Gaza, without being told how these were obtained.
The images showed long corridors, reinforced by concrete and metal, wide and high enough for a vehicle to pass through.
One intelligence officer said they would “not be surprised” if there were more than 500 kilometres of deep, interlacing tunnels in total.
“All of Gaza Strip is a matrix of tunnels… Imagine how many hostages you can put inside.”

'They can't leave Gaza': The Palestinians fighting for climate in face of Israel's violations,"Hadeel Ikhmais, the head of the climate change section of Palestine's Environment Quality AuthorityLauren Boland / The JournalLauren Boland / The Journal / The Journal
TUCKED AWAY AMONG the dozens of pavilions at COP28, a major international climate conference taking place right now in Dubai, Palestine is hosting a pavilion for the first time – under very different circumstances than what it expected when it started planning for the summit last year.
“We had lots of initiatives from youth and from women who were going to talk about their work here – but they can’t leave Gaza,” said Hadeel Ikhmais, the head of the climate change section of Palestine’s Environment Quality Authority.
Palestine is a member of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the overarching international treaty governing climate action. It submitted its national climate plan to the UN in 2017, followed by an updated version in 2021, committing to mitigate its emissions – which are already very low – and adapt to reduce the impacts of climate change.
But those efforts are seriously hampered by environmental damage caused by Israel.
Areport by the UN Environment Programmein 2020 identified “substantial evidence of environmental change and degradation in the occupied Palestinian territory”.
The 186-page report detailed how Israeli settlements and security measures have caused environmental degradation in Palestine, citing examples such as the uprooting of trees to clear land for military bases.
In an interview withThe Journal, Hadeel Ikhmais of the Environment Quality Authority described Israel’s environmental impacts on Palestine and the challenges of getting to COP28.
“The environmental violations by the Israeli occupation started a long time ago. They didn’t start with the latest genocide in Gaza,” Ikhmais said. “It exacerbates the problem of climate change.”
“The first basic human right is water,” she said.
People in Gaza rely on coastal aquifers for drinking water and agriculture, which are rock formations that hold water underground. Gaza’s coastal aquifer is more than ten metres below sea level and is severely polluted.
“In Gaza, they have very polluted aquifers. There’s over-extraction, there’s wastewater contamination, and there’s water salination,” Ikhmais said.
She outlined how the practice of confiscating land from farmers damages Palestinian society and environment.
“They go to the farmers and take and confiscate their lands from them. They uproot the olive trees, which is the national tree of Palestine. It is a national treasure, the number one economy in the agriculture sector, and also our culture,” Ikhmais said.
“There’s uprooting and burning by the settlers to these farms, especially during the harvest season, and the atrocities of the Israeli occupation soldiers and settlers to the people in the fields who are planting their roots and their trees or harvesting. A lot of atrocities and a lot of violations to the environment.”
Illegal dumping and the treatment of electronic waste are serious problems for Palestine’s environment, with uncontrolled treatment of e-waste is releasing carcinogens affecting people in both Palestine and Israel, according to the UNEP report.

“The settlements are well known for their economic activity and industrial activity regarding chemical waste, the heavy metals industry, and all of these products and byproducts are disposed to the Palestinian environment,” Ikhmais said.

Projections suggest that average temperatures will increase in Palestine by between 1.2 and 2.6 degrees Celsius by the middle of the century.
Hazards like heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms, and sand and dust storms are expected to become more frequent and more severe.
“The challenging environment in Palestine is exacerbated by climate change and climate change is exacerbated by the challenging conditions of having the Israeli occupation,” Ikhmais said.
“We have a very challenging environment to climate change and transformation. Every city or every region has its own challenges. Gaza is under siege since more than 20 years ago. It has a coastal city, so it has the risk of flooding due to the high level rise of sea water.
“Also, Gaza suffers in energy. The energy situation of Gaza is worse than the situation of energy in the West Bank, although both of them are challenging. We don’t generate electricity, we buy it from Israeli companies at a very high charge, and there are outages in summer and in winter.
“In the Gaza Strip, the amount of electricity is much less because it is under siege, so they have to depend on fuels that are so limited.
“This is what happened through the last war and during this continuous genocide. The genocide is now continuing in Gaza after a few days of ceasefire. The situation in general, [even] before the last incidents, was very challenging to the environment and in the state of Palestine, from the presence of the occupation that hinders all the aspects of life in Palestine.”

The major business of COPs happens in negotiating rooms, but governments, NGOs, campaigners, universities, businesses, and other organisations use it as a chance to hold meetings on the side about important climate matters, host talks and events, and to highlight domestic climate action.
Many of them do that through hosting a pavilion, which is typically half event-space, half-exhibition.
Palestine’s environment officials first started planning to host a pavilion at the conference around this time last year, when countries met in Egypt forCOP27.
“It was at the COP27 we had the idea that Palestine should be there as a pavilion to speak up and to participate with the other countries and to be in close contact with the international community regarding climate action, because we were well recognised at many conferences as being an active player,” Ikhmais said.
“We want to implement the climate action plans that we developed. We are looking for implementation and more stakeholder engagement, because there is a lot of support Palestine for regarding many projects in water, environment, energy, renewables. solar panels – different components being supported by development projects and environmental projects. We wanted to expand this kind of participation and engagement with stakeholders for further acceleration of implementation on the ground.”
However, those plans changed after 7 October, when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages, and Israel declared war, launching an offensive on Gaza and killing at least 15,500 people in the weeks since.
Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007, with entry and exit possible at only three crossings – two to Israel and one to Egypt. On 9 October this year, Israel ramped up the blockade to what its defence minister described as a “complete siege”.
“The military’s hideous attacks made us drop a lot of our plans,” Ikhmais said. “We had participation from colleagues on the Gaza Strip who were coming to COP28. We had lots of initiatives from youth and from women who were going to talk about their initiatives here and all of that here – but they can’t leave Gaza.

“Because of the checkpoints between the cities, I cannot go to the border easily. There was a lot of stopping and checkpoints and we had to take dangerous shortcuts to be able to reach to the borders. When we were there, it was a very long hours waiting that we experienced.
“The agenda is totally different – climate action, and also what is happening on the ground, in Gaza and also in West Bank.”

Speaking to Irish reporters at COP28, Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said he had been “very worried” ahead of the conference that tensions between countries with conflicting stances on Palestine and Israel would impede decisions on climate action.
“I thought with the Gaza war, surely, how could you debate anything when there’s a war in the Middle East?” he said.
“But there’s also a strong sense towards consensus because the world is burning and flooding and the evidence of climate change is everywhere.”
The EU’s Commissioner for the Environment Virginijus Sinkevičius expressed thesame sentimentbefore the conference, saying he expected that the world’s “geopolitical situation” would “inevitably” impact the negotiations.
In some ways, it has. The Iranian delegation walked out of a set of negotiations on Friday in protest at Israel’s presence and the leaders of a few countries that support Palestine mentioned Gaza in their speeches to the conference. But for the most part, official delegates at COP seem to want to avoid talking about Gaza.
“On the world leader side, it was so weak. The presence of the Gazan case and the Palestinian case, it wasn’t so strong,” Ikhmais said, speaking about speeches delivered by heads of states and governments in the opening days of the conference.
“From the high-level summit, it wasn’t as it should be. But from the community level, a lot of people came and showed their support,” she said.
A protest demanding a ceasefire in Gaza drew aconsiderable crowdyesterday afternoon, while apress conferenceheld earlier in the week by climate justice campaigners expressed solidarity with Palestine.
“As the world is gathering, we cannot ignore something like this that is happening in our midst and not speak out,” Lidy Nacpil of the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development said at the press conference.

Israel hasexpanded its offensivein Gaza in the wake of a days-long truce ended on Friday, with the Israeli military saying it has carried out around 10,000 air strikes since the start of the war.
“This is very hard, on the psychological level, on the spiritual level, because I’m sitting here thinking of my people who are being attacked and are under this genocide,” Ikhmais said.
“But this is our job and we have to be here. Palestinians should be in every international attendance and speak up and say the truth about the Israeli occupation and that the atrocities of this occupation and the genocide they are making, and also all of the the horrible actions that we are experiencing in our daily lives.
“We are here under very challenging situations back home and very challenging situations on the international level because we need more pressure, we need more action on the ground to have a ceasefire and to be able to have a life in Gaza and in Palestine after all these actions of the Israeli occupation.”

Fresh Israeli bombardment of Gaza as Hamas and Islamic Jihad launch rockets into Israel,"LAST UPDATE|3 Dec 2023

ISRAEL CARRIED OUT bombardments in Gaza this morning as international calls mounted for greater protection of civilians and the renewal of an expired truce with Palestinian militant group Hamas.
The Israeli army said it had conducted more than 400 strikes in Gaza since a ceasefire collapsed on Friday, with the Hamas government saying at least 240 people had been killed.
Hamas and Palestinian group Islamic Jihad announced “rocket barrages” against multiple Israeli cities and towns including Tel Aviv, and Israel said that two of its soldiers had died in combat, the first since the end of the truce.
At least seven people were killed in an Israeli bombing early this morning near Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, the Hamas-run government said.
Israeli strikes also hit the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza late Saturday, killing at least 13 people, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
US Vice President Kamala Harris yesterday sharply rebuked the rising civilian toll in Israel’s eight-week war, sparked by an unprecedented attack on October 7.
“Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed,” she told reporters at UN climate talks in Dubai.
“Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating.”
An estimated 1.7 million people in Gaza – more than two-thirds of the population – have been displaced by war, according to the United Nations.
“I cannot find words strong enough to express our concern over what we’re witnessing,” the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Sunday on X, formerly Twitter.
Fadel Naim, chief doctor at the Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, said his morgue had received 30 bodies on Saturday, including seven children.
“The planes bombed our houses: three bombs, three houses destroyed,” Nemr al-Bel, 43, told AFP, adding he had counted 10 dead in his family and “13 more still under the rubble”.
Pope Francis said today he was saddened the truce in the Gaza Strip had been broken and urged those involved to reach a new ceasefire deal as soon as possible.

“There is so much suffering in Gaza,” the pontiff said in Italian from his private residence, in remarks broadcast on giant screens in Saint Peter’s Square.
He said the end of the ceasefire meant “death, destruction, misery”, stressing that the besieged Palestinian territory lacked even essential supplies.
He said the situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories was “serious”. “Many hostages have been freed but so many others are still in Gaza,” he said.
Gazans are short of food, water and other essentials, and many homes have been destroyed. UN agencies have declared a humanitarian catastrophe, although some aid trucks did arrive Saturday.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said Israel had told NGOs not to bring aid convoys across the Rafah border crossing from Egypt after the truce expired.
But the charity said on Saturday its Egyptian colleagues had managed to send over a number of trucks.
Israeli negotiators left Doha on Saturdayafter reaching a dead end in talks aimed at securing a fresh pause in hostilities.
The Israeli army said 137 hostages were still being held in Gaza.
Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters yesterday that fresh military action was needed to “create the conditions that push (Hamas) to pay a heavy price, and that is in the release of hostages”.
Israeli hostages released from Gaza spoke publicly on Saturday for the first time, urging their government to secure the release of the remaining captives.
“The moral obligation of this government is to bring them home immediately, without hesitation,” said Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, who was released by Hamas in October, before the truce deal.
French President Emmanuel Macron appealed for “stepped-up efforts to reach a lasting ceasefire” to free all hostages, allow in more aid and to assure Israel of its security.
He took issue with Israel’s stated war aims, warning that if the “total destruction of Hamas” in Gaza was the goal, “the war will last 10 years”.
Hamas fighters broke through Gaza’s militarised border into Israel on 7 October, killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 240 Israelis and foreigners hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response and unleashed an air and ground campaign that has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, the Hamas authorities who run Gaza say.

A week-long truce, brokered with the help of Qatar and backed by Egypt and the United States, led to the release of 80 Israeli hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
But that truce collapsed with both sides blaming each other for violating its conditions.
Israel said that Hamas had tried to fire a rocket before the ceasefire ended, and that it had failed to produce a list of further hostages for release.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war would continue “until we achieve all its aims” including eliminating the Islamist movement.
“Our soldiers prepared during the days of truce for total victory against Hamas,” he said in Tel Aviv on Saturday, at his first press conference since fighting resumed.
“There is no way to win except by continuing the ground campaign,” Netanyahu told reporters, underscoring that this would be done while “observing international law”.
Israel’s air, naval and ground forces have attacked more than 400 targets in Gaza since the ceasefire ended, the army said on Saturday.
The figure is roughly in line with the daily average number of strikes prior to the pause, according to military figures released previously.
Warplanes hit “more than 50 targets in an extensive attack in the Khan Yunis area” of southern Gaza, according to the military.
Separately, members of an Israeli armoured brigade “eliminated terrorist squads and directed fire against terrorist targets in the north of the Gaza Strip”, the military said.
In the occupied West Bank, the Israeli army said troops shot dead a Palestinian at a checkpoint near the city of Nablus after he “drew a knife and started to advance towards them.”
Syria said Israel carried out air strikes near Damascus on Saturday.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guard accused Israel of killing two of its members in Syria who it said had been on an “advisory mission”.

Israeli forces move towards crowded southern Gaza after pulling negotiators out of truce talks,"LAST UPDATE|2 Dec 2023

ISRAEL HAS POUNDED targets in the crowded southern half of the Gaza Strip and ordered more neighbourhoods designated for attack to evacuate, driving up the death toll the US and others urged it to do more to protect Gaza civilians.
Smoke again clouded the sky over the north of the Palestinian territory, whose Hamas government said 240 people had been killed since a pause in hostilitiesexpired early and combat resumed yesterday.
This comes as Israel announced it was pulling its Mossad negotiators out of Qatar, which is mediating efforts tosecure a renewed pause in the Israel-Hamas war, after a deadlock in the talks.
“Following the impasse in the negotiations and at the direction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, David Barnea, head of the Mossad, ordered his team in Doha to return to Israel,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.
At almost exactly the same time Israeli negotiators pulled out of deadlocked truce talks in Qatar, Israeli jets sent a prestige Doha-funded housing development in the Gaza Strip up in smoke.
Hamad City is named for the former emir of the Gulf petro-state, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, who laid the foundation stone on a visit 11 years ago.
Inaugurated in 2016, it was still among the newest projects in the Gaza Strip, the housing complex in the city of Khan Yunis boasting an impressive mosque, shops and gardens.
The first flats – more than 1,000 of them – were provided to Palestinians whose homes were destroyed in the war between Israel and Hamas two years earlier.
Today it happened again, a day after a Qatar-brokered pause in the current war between Israel and Hamas expired.
First their phones pinged around noon with an “immediate” evacuation order SMS sent by the Israeli army, which says the system is aimed at minimising civilian casualties.
Around an hour later, five Israeli air strikes rained down on the neighbourhood in the space of just two minutes.
Bombs slammed into the pale apartment blocks one by one, reducing them largely to rubble and sending a huge pall of black smoke into the sky, as people fled and cries of ‘help!’ and ‘ambulance!’ rang out.
“At least we got through it,” 26-year-old Nader Abu Warda told AFP, amazed he was still alive.
According to the United Nations an estimated 1.7 million people in Gaza – around 80 percent of the population – have been displaced by eight weeks of war.
Several homes were hit across Gaza today, with multiple casualties reported in a strike that flattened a multi-storey building on the outskirts of Gaza City.

Warplanes hit “more than 50 targets in an extensive attack in the Khan Yunis area” of Gaza’s south, the military added.
The population is short of food, water and other essentials, and many homes have been destroyed. UN agencies have declared a humanitarian catastrophe, although some aid trucks did arrive today.
After the truce between Israel and Hamas expired yesterday, Israel had told NGOs not to bring aid convoys across the Rafah border crossing from Egypt, the Palestine Red Crescent Society had said.
But in a social media post the charity said its Egyptian colleagues had managed to send over a number of trucks.
Fadel Naim, chief doctor at the Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, told AFP that his morgue had received 30 bodies since the morning, including seven children.
“The planes bombed our houses: three bombs, three houses destroyed,” Nemr al-Bel, 43, told AFP, adding that he had counted 10 dead in his family and “13 more still under the rubble”.
Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce, which had enabled the release of 80 Israeli hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.
Since the end of the pause, Israel’s air, naval and ground forces have attacked more than 400 targets in Gaza, the army said. The figure is roughly in line with the daily average number of strikes prior to the pause, according to military figures released previously.
International leaders and humanitarian groups condemned the return to fighting.
“I deeply regret that military operations have started again in Gaza,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on X, formerly Twitter.
“Today, in a matter of hours, scores were reportedly killed and injured,” UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said. “Families were told to evacuate, again. Hopes were dashed.”
French President Emmanuel Macron has also appealed for intensified efforts to reach a lasting ceasefire in Gaza.
“This situation requires stepped-up efforts to reach a lasting ceasefire,” to free all hostages held by Hamas, allow more urgently needed aid into Gaza, and to assure Israel of its security, he told a news conference on the sidelines of the UN’s COP28 climate talks in Dubai.
Separately, members of an Israeli armoured brigade “eliminated terrorist squads and directed fire against terrorist targets in the north of the Gaza Strip”, the military said.
During an unprecedented attack on October 7, Hamas fighters broke through Gaza’s militarised border into Israel, killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 240 Israelis and foreigners hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response and unleashed an air and ground campaign that has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, the Hamas authorities who run Gaza say.
The Israeli military has divided the Gaza Strip into 2,300 “blocs” and is now sending SMS messages to residents telling them to leave before they launch the strikes which they say will “eliminate Hamas”.

Around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died in the militant’s 7 October assault on southern Israel and some 240 were taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
The Hamas-led Gaza Strip government says Israel’s campaign has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, since it was launched eight weeks ago.
The United Nations humanitarian agency, OCHA, has highlighted that the warning messages do not indicate where the recipients should go.
Ibrahim al-Jamal, a civil servant in his 40s, said he does not have any “internet, any electricity or even a radio to receive information” and that he has “never seen this map” setting out the different blocs.
“Many people in Gaza have never heard of it and it wouldn’t matter anyway as the bombings are taking place everywhere,” he said.
Humanitarian bodies say the most vulnerable in Gaza are the estimated 1.7 million displaced people.
Many of them do not have access to phones and have to rely on warning leaflets dropped by planes, not visible from inside an apartment.
Fighting also resumed on Israel’s northern border.
The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran, said two of its members were killed Friday in Israeli strikes on Lebanon, as its fighters resumed attacks against Israeli targets following the end of the truce.
Israel’s military said its artillery struck the sources of “launches” from Lebanon.
Syria said Israel carried out air strikes near Damascus on Saturday. A British-based war monitor said the strikes on “Hezbollah sites” killed two Syrian pro-Hezbollah fighters.
Hamas in October last year said it had restored relations with Syria’s government. Israeli attacks on targets in Syria have intensified since the Israel-Hamas war began.
Despite the resumption of deadly fighting, efforts to reach another truce went on.
“We’re going to continue to work with Israel and Egypt and Qatar on efforts to reimplement the pause,” United States Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Friday.

"Israel resumes fighting in Gaza, with airstrikes and artillery fire reported as truce expires","LAST UPDATE|1 Dec 2023

FIGHTING HAS RESUMED in Gaza immediately after the expiry of a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas, with the first fatalities reported minutes later, according to health officials in the Palestinian territory.
An AFPTV livecam showed a heavy cloud of grey smoke rolling over northern Gaza, and apparent sounds of automatic weapons fire and explosions within the first 90 minutes after the truce expired at 5am Irish time.
Israel’s military said fighter jets were “currently striking” Hamas targets in Gaza, and AFP journalists reported air strikes in the north and south of the territory.
Tánaiste Micheál Martin said there is a “deep sense of outrage and disappointment” that fighting has resumed.
“I condemn the reckless and indiscriminate actions of Hamas,” said Martin.
“I also condemn the bombardment of Gaza that is now under way.

He said the pause in “recent days was highly valuable” and added: “It is important to stress the catastrophic impact Israel’s military action is having on children and the most vulnerable civilians in Gaza.”
Martin has called for a “durable humanitarian ceasefire and full respect for International Humanitarian Law”, adding that “Gaza’s civilian population cannot be allowed to suffer any further”.
Martin also said he will “work with EU and international partners to deliver a permanent ceasefire and move towards a meaningful political process”.
Marwan al-Hams, the director of Al-Najar hospital in Rafah in southern Gaza, where many Palestinians fled after being told by Israel to leave the north of the territory, said strikes killed at least nine people in the city, including four children.
Elsewhere, two children were killed in air raids on Gaza City, said Fadel Naim, a doctor with Al-Ahli hospital in the city.
A source close to Hamas told AFP the group’s armed wing had received “the order to resume combat” and to “defend the Gaza Strip”, with heavy fighting reported in parts of Gaza City.
Combat resumed shortly after Israel’s army said it had intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza, the first from the territory since a missile launched minutes into the start of the truce on 24 November.
The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said fighting had restarted after Hamas “violated” the truce.

“Upon the resumption of fighting, we emphasise: The Government of Israel is committed to achieving the goals of the war: Releasing the hostages, eliminating Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to the residents of Israel,” it said in a statement.
Sirens warning of potential missile fire sounded around several communities near Gaza in the hour after the fighting resumed, and Israeli authorities said they were restarting security measures in the area including closing schools.

UN chief Antonio Gurerres said he deeply regretted the resumption of hostilities.
“I deeply regret that military operations have started again in Gaza. I still hope that it will be possible to renew the pause that was established. The return to hostilities only shows how important it is to have a true humanitarian ceasefire,” the United Nations secretary-general said on X, formerly Twitter.
Despite the resumption of fighting, talks between Qatari and Egyptian mediators were “ongoing”, said a source briefed on the talks.
During the seven-day truce dozens of hostages were freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and more aid entered Gaza where about 80% of the population is displaced and grappling with shortages of food, water and other essentials.
Yesterday, US top diplomat Antony Blinken, meeting Israeli and Palestinian officials, called for the pause in hostilities to be extended, and warned any resumption of combat must protect Palestinian civilians.
Other world leaders, and aid groups, had also sought an extended pause.
The truce had paused fighting that began on 7 October when Hamas militants broke through Gaza’s militarised border into Israel.
The unprecedented attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and militants kidnapped about 240, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response and unleashed an air and ground military campaign in Gaza that the Hamas government says has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
During the truce brokered by Qatar with support from Egypt and the United States, 80 Israeli hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.

That brought the total freed yesterday to eight, less than the 10 hostages a day the truce deal required Hamas to release. A source close to the militant group said it was counting two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday as part of the seventh batch.
Not long after the hostages arrived in Israel, the country’s prison service said another 30 Palestinian prisoners – 23 minors and seven women – had been freed.
After meeting leaders in Israel and the occupied West Bank, Blinken said Washington wants “to see this process continue to move forward”.
“We want an eighth day and beyond.”
A source close to Hamas said the group backed another extension and mediators were working to prolong the pause, but the negotiations appeared to have failed.
Israel had made clear it viewed the truce as a temporary pause to secure the release of hostages.
“We swore … to eliminate Hamas, and nothing will stop us,” Netanyahu said in a video released by his office, after meeting with Blinken.
His government has come under increasing pressure, however, to account for how it will protect civilians in the territory, which is under blockade, with no way for people to escape.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a press conference in Tel Aviv, IsraelAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
Blinken had warned that any resumed military operation by Israel “must put in place humanitarian civilian protection plans that minimise further casualties of innocent Palestinians”.
Specifically, Israel must “clearly and precisely” designate areas “in southern and central Gaza, where they can be safe and out of the line of fire”, he said.
The violence in Gaza has also raised tensions in the West Bank, where nearly 240 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers since 7 October, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry.
The New York Timesreported overnight that Israeli authorities were aware Hamas was planning a major assault, and had obtained a blueprint for the attack, which the group appears to have largely followed on 7 October.
Intelligence and military officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, even after a warning that the group had carried out a training exercise in line with the plan, according to the report.

Israel and Hamas agree to a day-long extension to ceasefire as eight more hostages are released,"LAST UPDATE|30 Nov 2023

HAMAS HAS RELEASED eight more hostages, with more Palestinian prisoners to be freed under an extended truce that has paused weeks of deadly conflict.
With the current truce set to expire early tomorrow, international bodies have called for a lasting halt to the violence, sparked by deadly Hamas attacks on Israel that prompted it to mount a devastating assault on the Gaza Strip.
Dual nationals from Uruguay, Mexico and Russia were among eight Israeli hostages released by Hamas on the seventh day of the Gaza truce, mediator Qatar said on Friday.
“The eight Israeli citizens being released today as part of the agreement include two minors and six women,” the Qatari foreign ministry said.
He said 30 Palestinians would be released from Israeli prisons, in exchange for a total of 10 hostages in Gaza, a tally which included “two Russian citizens who were released yesterday”.
The delicate truce held through its seventh day after a 24-hour extension despite a shooting claimed by Hamas militants that killed three people in Jerusalem.
US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders to seek a longer pause that would allow further prisoner-hostage exchanges and more aid for displaced civilians in Gaza.
Earlier, the Israeli military said at least two women hostages had been returned from Gaza after being released to the Red Cross by Hamas. This came before the release of an additional six people.

France president Emmanuel Macron described the news as “great joy”.
Only hours after the truce extension, the Islamist militants claimed responsibility for ashooting in Jerusalem that killed three people and called for an “escalation of the resistance”.
The morning attack saw two gunmen from annexed east Jerusalem kill three people and wound eight others at a bus stop in the western part of the city, before two off-duty soldiers and civilians fired at them and “neutralised” them, police said.
Separately, two Israeli soldiers were slightly injured in a ramming attack on a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank today, the army said, adding the assailant had also been “shot and neutralised”.
International bodies have called for more time to allow medical supplies, food and fuel into the besieged Gaza Strip after fierce combat and bombardments sparked by Hamas’s bloody 7 October attacks on Israel.

The truce agreement allows for extensions if Hamas can continue to release 10 hostages per day, but both sides have warned they are ready to return to fighting.
Since the truce began on 24 November, 70 Israeli hostages have been freed in return for 210 Palestinian prisoners.
At least 24 foreigners, most of them Thais living in Israel, have been freed outside the terms of the deal.
Israel says it sees the truce as a temporary halt intended to free hostages, but there are growing calls for a more sustained pause in fighting.
The hostage releases have brought joy tinged with agony, with families anxiously waiting each night to learn if their loved ones will be freed, and learning harrowing details from those who return.

Before the truce Israeli ground and air forces had pounded Gaza, forcing an estimated 1.7 million people – around 80% of the Hamas-run territory’s population – to leave their homes and limiting the entry of food, water, medicine and fuel.
The truce has allowed some of the displaced to return to their homes, but for many there is little left.

Conditions in Gaza remain “catastrophic” and the population faces a “high risk of famine”, according to the World Food Programme.
The truce has allowed some of the displaced to return to their homes, but for many there is little left.
“I discovered that my house had been completely destroyed – 27 years of my life to build it and everything is gone,” said Taghrid al-Najjar, 46, after returning to her home in southeastern Gaza.
The violence in Gaza has also raised tensions in the West Bank, where nearly 240 Palestinians have been killed by either Israeli soldiers or settlers since 7 October, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
That figure exceeds the entire toll in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for all of last year when 235 people died, mostly Palestinians, an AFP tally showed.

Two dead and eight injured after shooting in Jerusalem,"
TWO PEOPLE HAVE been killed and eight have been wounded in a shooting in Jerusalem this morning, first responders said.
Police said two suspects “implicated in the shootings were neutralised on the spot” after the attack near a bus stop on the western side of Jerusalem, where there are no checkpoints guarding entrance to the city.
Five people have been left in a serious condition, first responders have said.
“Two terrorists arrived in a car, one of them armed with an M-16 and the other with a pistol,” and opened fire, Jerusalem police chief Doron Torgeman told reporters at the scene.
The Magen David Adom emergency service said one of the victims was a 24-year-old woman.
The attack came shortly after atruce pausing fighting in the Gaza Strip between Hamas and Israel was extended for a seventh day, moments before it was due to expire.

Two weeks ago an Israeli soldier died after being shot in an attack on a checkpoint on the eastern side of Jerusalem at the entrance to a tunnel linking the occupied West Bank with the city.
Another five Israeli security personnel were also wounded, with Israeli police shooting dead all three assailants. That attack was claimed by the armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades.
Tensions between Israel and the West Bank have been increasing since conflict broke out in Gaza over eight weeks ago.
Yesterday an eight-year-old boy and a teenager were killedby the Israeli army today in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
The ministry said in a statement that “Adam al-Ghul, eight years old, and Bassem Abu el-Wafa, 15 years old, were killed by bullets from the occupier”.
CCTV footage circulating online and on television news shows a boy being struck by a bullet and falling in the street, sending other children fleeing.
Other images show a teenager also being hit by a bullet and falling, then appearing to call for help as more shots hit the ground around him and other people run for cover.

Mediators working to extend truce as Israel army investigates Hamas report of baby hostage death,"LAST UPDATE|29 Nov 2023

MEDIATORS ARE WORKING to extend the truce between Israel and Hamas, as more hostages were released on what is the sixth and final day of the temporary ceasefire.
A group of ten Israeli hostages and four Thais freed by Hamas in the Gaza Strip arrived in Egypt tonight, state-linked television showed.
In a statement, the Israeli military said the released hostages were on their way to Israel through Egyptian territory.
It comes as Israel’s army today said it was investigating a report by Hamas’s armed wing that a 10-month-old baby hostage, his four-year-old brother and their mother had all been killed in Gaza.
The military was “verifying the accuracy of the information”, it said in a statement.
It added: “Hamas is endangering the lives of all the hostages in the Gaza Strip, who include nine children, and is responsible for their security.”
Amid negotiations to extend a truce over Gaza, a senior Hamas official said it was ready to release all the Israeli soldiers it is holding captive in exchange for all Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.
“We are ready to release all soldiers in exchange for all our prisoners,” Hamas official and former Gaza health minister Bassem Naim told a press conference in Cape Town, South Africa.
A Hamas source also said, hours before the truce is set to expire, that the Palestinian militant group is not satisfied with Israel’s proposals for another extension.
“What is being proposed in the discussions to extend the truce is not the best,” the source told AFP, adding that the talks were focused on an extension of “two days or more” of the pause.
The current truce is scheduled to expire tonight after a six-day pause in the conflict, sparked by deadly Hamas attacks that prompted a devastating Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip.
So far, 60 Israeli hostages have been freed from Gaza under the terms of the deal, with a Russian-Israeli, 20 Thais and one Filipino freed outside the scope of the agreement.
In return, 180 Palestinian prisoners – all women and children – have been released.
With more set to walk free today under the agreement, Qatari mediators said they were working for a “sustainable” ceasefire.
Today, Hamas “informed the mediators that it is willing to extend the truce for four days,” a source close to the militant group told AFP on condition of anonymity.
Under that arrangement, “the movement would be able to release Israeli prisoners that it, other resistance movements and other parties hold during this period, according to the terms of the existing truce,” the source added.

Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari told a Doha news conference yesterday that negotiators were seeking “a sustainable truce that will lead to further negotiations and eventually to an end… to this war.”
A source with knowledge of the talks added in comments to AFP today that discussions were “focused on building on the progress of the extended humanitarian pause agreement and to initiate further discussions about the next phase of a potential deal.”
After a 48-hour extension of an initial four-day truce, a new group of 12 hostages was freed from Gaza yesterday, with 30 Palestinians released by Israel.
An AFP journalist saw masked and armed fighters from the militant groups Hamas and the Islamic Jihad hand over hostages to Red Cross officials in Rafah, near the border with Egypt.

The Israeli hostages freed were all women, including 17-year-old Mia Leimberg, who returned to Israel with her mother and aunt.
The three were all abducted from kibbutz Nir Yitzhak, and the teenager was seen after her release holding her dog Bella.
The grandmother of 12-year-old Eitan Yahalomi, who was released on Monday, said the boy had been held in solitary confinement for 16 days.
“The days that he was alone were horrible,” Esther Yaeli told Israeli news website Walla. “Now Eitan appears very withdrawn.”
Hamas has also released a Russian-Israeli, 20 Thais and one Filipino outside the scope of the agreement.
Thailand’s foreign ministry said 17 of the released Thai hostages would arrive back in the kingdom tomorrow. It said about 13 Thais remained among the hostages held in Gaza.
Among the Palestinian prisoners freed in yesterday’s exchange was 14-year-old Ahmad Salaima who returned to his home in east Jerusalem to cheers and hugs from relatives.
“When Ahmed was in prison, we couldn’t visit him, even though he’s the youngest Palestinian prisoner,” his father Nayef said.
Israel’s government has received a list of the new hostages to be freed Wednesday, Israeli media reported. There was no official confirmation.
The truce agreement has brought a temporary halt to fighting that began on 7 October when Hamas militants crossed the border into Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping about 240.

Israel’s subsequent air and ground campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to Palestinian officials, and reduced large parts of the north of the territory to rubble.
The World Food Programme warned yesterday that Gaza’s population faced a “high risk of famine if WFP is not able to provide continued access to food.”

Conditions in the territory are “catastrophic,” the agency’s Middle East director Corinne Fleischer said.
The spokesman for the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry, Ashraf al-Qudra, told AFP Wednesday that doctors found five premature babies dead in Gaza City’s Al-Nasr hospital.
A spokesman for the UN children’s agency UNICEF said aid entering Gaza under the truce deal was “not even enough for triage,” or emergency care.
Speaking from a shelter in Khan Younis, Christian Aid’s consultant in Gaza has said the truce has given the opportunity for more humanitarian aid to come in, “but 200 truckloads a day is not enough at all to cover the very high needs of people in the Gaza strip”.
“Hopefully aid will be increased so more people can be given food, water, fuel, medicine and all the other things that are desperately needed here,” the consultant said, adding that they hoped the truce would continue and lead to a sustainable ceasefire.
Yesterday, Hamas and Israel traded accusations of truce violations, but Qatar’s Ansari said the “minimal breaches” did not “harm the essence of the agreement.”
Israel has made clear it sees the truce as a brief interlude to ensure hostage releases before its war continues.
Israel’s allies have been wary of calling for a complete end to military operations designed to eliminate Hamas, but foreign ministers from the Group of Seven have urged a longer truce.
“We support the further extension of this pause and future pauses as needed to enable assistance to be scaled up, and to facilitate the release of all hostages,” they said in a statement Tuesday.
Washington has also warned Israel that any fresh offensive in southern Gaza must be “done in a way… not designed to produce significant further displacement,” a senior US official said.
An estimated 1.7 million Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to leave their homes so far, more than half the territory’s population, according to the United Nations.
“I hope this truce will lead to a complete ceasefire, because we are fed up of sleeping outdoors in the rain, of losing our loved ones and having to flee,” said Umm Mohammed, who was forced from her home in northern Gaza by the assault.
The truce in Gaza has not ended violence in the occupied West Bank, where two Palestinian teenagers were killed in clashes with Israeli troops yesterday, the Palestinian health ministry said.
Since the 7 October attacks, more than 230 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli soldiers or settlers, according to the ministry.

Request to fly Palestinian flag in Leinster House refused as Govt accused of 'double standards',"CEANN COMHAIRLE SEÁN Ó Fearghaíl has refused a request to have the Palestinian flag flown in Leinster House.
People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy said the request was made last week to fly the flag on today as part of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.
In a letter, the Ceann Comhairle said that he believed it would be “inappropriate” to fly either the Palestinian flag or the Israeli flag at Leinster House at present.
“Given the sensitivities of the situation at present, with negotiations at an advance stage for the release of hostages and to advance the cause of a ceasefire, I believe it would be inappropriate to display any symbols including the Palestinian or indeed, the Israeli flag at Leinster House at this juncture,” Ó Fearghaíl wrote.
The letter is dated 23 November, which is prior to the ceasefire being agreed.

Speaking in the Dáil, TD Richard Boyd Barrett said the government was showing “double standards” regarding its attitude to the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the devastation that has been inflicted on the people of Gaza.
“I know that these are only symbols, but the contrast is summed up with the fact that today, for two years, we have had the Ukrainian flags flying here, but we cannot fly the Palestinian flag, even though the local authorities in Dún Laoghaire and in south Dublin, in Fingal and in Cork are flying the Palestinian flag in solidarity with the suffering of the Palestinian people.
“Why is the Palestinian flag not flying out there on a day when they have suffered genocide at the hands of Israel?” he asked.
Justice Minister Helen McEntee said it is clear that the government continues to support the Palestinian people “in the position we have taken on a two-state solution”.
“We have consistently called for a ceasefire and for humanitarian aid to be provided. That is the position we have taken and we have clearly shown, not just by our actions or by flags, but by the actions we have taken and the direction that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have taken, to ensure that we do everything in our power to protect those who are currently under fire, quite literally,” she added.

"Five premature babies found dead in Gaza hospital, says region's health ministry","
FIVE PREMATURE BABIES have been found dead at a hospital in Gaza City during a pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas, the Hamas-run health ministry today said.
Before a temporary truce in the seven-week war came into force on Friday, several hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip had been targeted by Israeli raids, with some evacuated on the orders of the Israeli army.
Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra told AFP that Israeli soldiers had blocked access to the intensive care unit at Al-Nasr paediatric facility, and doctors were finally “able to get into the ward on Tuesday night”.
There, Qudra said, “the occupation (Israeli) forces left five premature babies” who were found “partly decomposed”.

“The soldiers forbade the families from going near” the newborns before Tuesday, he said.
The Israeli army said it was unable to immediately comment on the matter when contacted by AFP.
Earlier this month, the world followed the fate of 39 premature babies trapped in another major Gaza City hospital, Al-Shifa, which was besieged and ultimately raided by Israeli forces.
Eight of the infants died due to a lack of electricity to run their incubators, the Hamas-run health ministry said.
Another 31 were evacuated, most of whom went on to Egypt for treatment.

Debunked: Old footage from Egypt shared with false claims it shows Israel storming Gaza hospital,"
DECADE-OLD FOOTAGE from Egypt has been re-shared online, where it has falsely been described as showing the Israel Defense Forces storming the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza.
The footage appears to show people seeking shelter in a hospital as gunshots can be heard outside.
“The Israeli army opened fire on the medics of the al-Shifa hospital in the Gaza Strip – Al Mayadeen TV channel,” a tweet featuring the footage that has been viewed more than 15,500 times on Twitter/X reads.
The same video and description were copied in posts by Irish users.
However, the video contains evidence that shows that this is not the case – not least, a logo in the corner of the Rassd News Network, an alternative media network based in Cairo, which is not for the Lebanese Al Mayadeen TV channel cited in the posts.
The video also features a view looking out the doors of the hospital, where large ornamental buildings can be seen which would look out of place in Gaza.
The buildings that can be seen match with the buildings of the Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque in the Nasr City district of Cairo.
A quick shot of the buildings outside the hospital allow for the location of the footage to be verified
Distinctivearches,parapets, and multiplesetsofwindows, as well as the buildinglayoutall appear to match images of the Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque which can be viewed online.
Interior shots in the video also matchimagesof the inside of the Rabaa Al-Adawiya Specialized Hospital, which look out onto that mosque.

Both of these buildings were in the area of a mass killing of civilians in 2013 when police sought to break up demonstrators, many of whom were protesting against a military coup that had deposed Egypt’s President Mohamed Morsi the previous month.
Known as the Rabaa massacre, the number of deaths as a result of the clashes is still a subject of dispute, with estimatesrangingfrom hundreds to as many as 2,600.
The YouTube account of the Rassd News Network, whose logo can be seen in the video, first uploadedthe videoin 2013, describing it as showing the Rabaa massacre, as had been identifiedby Reuters.
The Al-Shifa hospital was raided by Israeli forces earlier this month.
The hospital, Gaza’s largest, has become a focal point for Israel’s military operations, with the army repeatedly saying Hamas uses it as a base, a claim the Israeli military has been under pressure to back up.
The militants and medical staff have denied that a command centre is under the hospital.
Al-Shifa was described Sunday as a “death zone” by the World Health Organization, in the wake of incursions by Israeli soldiers and multiple strikes on the facility.
More than 250 patients and 20 healthcare workers remain at the hospital, the WHO said, after 31 premature babies were evacuated southwards, 28 of whom were transferred to Egypt on Monday.
The Journalhas previously debunked anold video from Syria that was shared online, falsely said to show Israel bombing another hospital in Gaza.
Since the recent wave of violence in Israel and Gaza began, misinformation and disinformationhas surgedon social media sites, often described as evidence of actions by either Hamas or Israeli forces.
These include video game clips being passed off ascombat footage, years-old videos of attacks,military demonstrations, orfirework displaysfrom other countries being shared with descriptions that they show combat in Gaza; fake accounts formedia organisationsand journalists being used to spread misinformation; and doctored government documents.

"Eight-year-old boy and teenager shot dead in West Bank, say Palestinian health ministry","
AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD boy and a teenager were killed by the Israeli army today in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
The ministry said in a statement that “Adam al-Ghul, eight years old, and Bassem Abu el-Wafa, 15 years old, were killed by bullets from the occupier”.
CCTV footage circulating online and on television news shows a boy being struck by a bullet and falling in the street, sending other children fleeing.

The teenager can be seen struggling on the ground in apparent agony for at least half a minute.
An official with the Palestinian Red Crescent told AFP that the boy and the teen had been on a side street of central Jenin’s main thoroughfare, an area theoretically off limits to the Israeli military as it is under the sole control of the Palestinian Authority.
Asked about the deaths by AFP, the army said it was “verifying” the information.
Since the 7 October attack on Israel and its ensuing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, violence in the West Bank has flared, with nearly 240 Palestinians killed by either soldiers or Israeli settlers, according to the health ministry.

"Emily Hand could only whisper after being released by Hamas, her father says","THE FATHER OF Irish-Israeli girl Emily Hand, who wasreleased last Saturdayafter being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for almost 50 days, has said his daughter would only speak in whispers after she was freed.
Thomas Hand, originally from Dun Laoghaire in Dublin, spoke toCNN last nightand described what his daughter experienced while being held hostage.
Nine-year-old Emily had been on a sleepover in the Kibbutz Be’eri where she lived, when it was raided by Hamas last month. Thomas was initially told she had died in the attack.
Describing seeing her for the first time after her release, he told CNN: “All of a sudden the door opened up and she just ran. It was beautiful, just like I had imagined it.
“The most shocking, disturbing part of meeting her was she was just whispering, you couldn’t hear her. I had to put my ear on her lips,” he said.
He said Emily thought he had also been kidnapped by Hamas, and when he asked her how long she had been held for, she said “a year”.
“Apart from the whispering, that was like a punch in the guts,” he said.

Speaking to The Sun, Thomas said he will do “whatever it takes” to restore his daughter’s sense of safety and wellbeing.
“I can’t bear to think about what she’s been through – she’s been terrorised by terrorists in hell – but as her dad, it’s my job to make it better, and I will,” he said.
Emily turned nine while being held hostage by Hamas. Her father said she lost more than half a stone during her time in captivity, but he is determined to help her heal.

He added: “It’s going to be a long road, but we’ll get there.”
Thomas thought his daughter was being held prisoner in tunnels nicknamed the “Gaza Metro” but Emily told him that was not the case.
“They made her run from the Israeli army from house to house. She was constantly being moved – sometimes under fire – to stay one step ahead of the army,” he said.
“She must have been absolutely terrified – an eight-year-old girl being led by strangers from one blown-up shell of a house to the next in the middle of a war zone.”

He continued: “I said when she was being held that I was horrified by the thought of her spending her ninth birthday in the tunnels under Gaza.
“But the reality of what was happening to her was actually much worse – and I’m glad I didn’t know what she was going through at the time.”
Thomas said that Emily remains in shock and is being evaluated by child trauma specialists in a hospital near Tel Aviv.
He said doctors have put her on a course of vitamins to boost her nervous system, and she is now “eating like a horse” after being deprived of food for more than seven weeks.
“I know now I’m going to become an overprotective dad and still can’t bear to let her out of my sight,” he said.
“But the last thing I would ever want is for her to feel trapped or threatened in any way again.”

Israeli President says Ireland needs to 'admit the truth' about conflict in Gaza,"THE ISRAELI PRESIDENT has questioned why he says the Irish government has not recognised the “tragedy Israel has seen”, asking: “What is the problem with admitting the truth?”
In an interview onRTÉ’s Prime Time last night, Isaac Herzog – whose father was Irish – justified his country’s government’s reaction to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s tweet and subsequent statement by saying it “hardly mentions” Israel and Hamas.
He added that while he has a lot of respect for Ireland and is proud for his family lineage to have hailed from the country, he questioned why the government could not be more specific in its statement.
Herzog said: ”How can it be that the Irish government cannot say, ‘Emily [Hand] – little Emily – she returned from being a hostage by Hamas, abducted from her home in Be’eri, Kibbutz  Be’eri,’ What’s wrong with that?”
In a statementafter the release of Emily Hand, Varadkar said: “A little girl was snatched from her home and held captive for almost seven weeks. She spent her ninth birthday as a hostage. We hope she will soon heal and recover from the traumatic experience in the loving embrace of her family.”
The taoiseach also called for all hostages to be released, and for a ceasefire to be placed in the region,a call he reiterated when responding to criticism to his original statement.
Herzog continued: “What’s the problem in just admitting the truth? And saying ‘We are really sorry for the tragedy Israel has seen and has befallen the people of Israel and Emily herself’.”

Members of government and opposition highlighted such Israeli strugglesin statements after the announcement of Emily Hand.
Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said: “I am conscious today that many more hostages remain in the hands of Hamas. I reiterate my call that all hostages in Gaza should be released immediately and unconditionally.”
Elsewhere in his statement Martin mentions the “weeks of trauma” Israeli hostages suffered from Hamas.
In a separate statement, Sinn Féin TD and leader of the opposition Mary Lou McDonald thanked all the mediators between Israel and Hamas who led the negotiations to free the hostages from Gaza and prisoners from Israel.
“The trauma and heartbreak that little Emily and her family have been subjected to over the last number of weeks is unimaginable,” she said.
On Saturday, Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen accused Varadkar of trying to legitimise and normalise terror and told him to check his moral compass.
Although Herzog could not speak for the country’s foreign minister he did ask to be told why Ireland isn’t staunchly pro-Israel.
“One has to understand the feeling that we’re feeling from out here. We’re looking at the picture and looking at Ireland, which is a very respected country and a great nation, and asking ourselves: ‘What did we do wrong that Ireland is so indifferent?’.”
Asked if Herzog truly believed his statement he argued “how could it not be” as he believes neither the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste express their support for Israel “outright”.

More hostages to be released as extended truce between Israel and Hamas enters fifth day,"
A TRUCE BETWEEN Israel and Hamas has entered a fifth day after both sides agreed to an extension of two days, as more hostages were freed from Gaza in exchange for the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners.
Mediator Qatar and Palestinian militant group Hamas confirmed the extension and Israeli media reported the government had received a new list of 10 more hostages who would be freed.
The 7am (5am Irish time) deadline for the previous pause in fighting to expire passed without incident, after 11 more Israeli hostages were freed from Gaza overnight.
This was matched by Israel with the release of another 33 Palestinian prisoners – the last exchange under the initial deal.
Qatar said the released Palestinian prisoners were made up of 30 children and three women. The Palestinian prisoners released so far have been mostly teenagers.
Many of the prisoners are being held for stone throwing and damaging property. According to BBC, most are in prison awaiting trial, with less than a quarter of those on the list having been convicted.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres hailed the “a glimpse of hope and humanity in the middle of the darkness of war”.
The truce paused fighting that began on 7 October when Hamas militants crossed the border into Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping dozens.
Israel’s retaliatory ground and air operation in the Gaza Strip has killed almost 15,000 people, mostly civilians, according to the Palestinian government.
Despite the truce extension, Israel has vowed to stick to its war aim of destroying Hamas and rescuing all 240 hostages held in the war zone.
Eleven hostages arrived in Israel late yesterday, the military said, adding: “Our forces will accompany them until they are reunited with their families.”

Most of the group are dual nationals, with Argentinians, French and Germans among those released, and all 11 were from the Nir Oz kibbutz, the community said.
Kibbutz official Osnat Peri said the releases brought “a sigh of relief to our community, however we remain deeply concerned about our loved ones that are still held hostage”.
Images released by the Israeli military showed French-Israeli child Eitan Yahalomi reunited with his mother, who gripped him tightly to her.

Shortly after the arrival of the hostages was confirmed, Israel’s prison authority said 33 Palestinian inmates had been released.
In annexed east Jerusalem, prisoner Muhammad Abu Al-Humus called his release “an indescribable joy” and kissed his mother’s hand as he entered his home.
Crowds in the West Bank town of Beitunia waved green Hamas flags to greet those arriving on a coach.
But nearby there were also clashes with Israeli troops by Ofer prison, with Palestinians burning tyres and throwing stones. The Palestinian health ministry said one person was killed.
Under the truce, 50 Israeli hostages have been released in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners. Another 19 have been freed under separate deals, including Thai workers and a dual Russian-Israeli citizen.
Hamas said it was now drawing up lists of additional hostages to be released, though the process is reportedly complicated by the fact that some are held by other militant groups.
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that “in order to extend the pause, Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children”.
Israel views the truce as temporary to secure hostage releases and plans to continue its war, with the government agreeing a 30.3 billion shekel (€7.4 billion) war budget that will now go to parliament.
Palestinians inspect the effects of destruction caused by Israeli air strikes on their homes in the Khuza'a area, in Khan Yunis, Gaza, on Monday.
But it faces increasing pressure for a more lasting ceasefire and the ramp-up of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where an estimated 1.7 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations.
This week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will pay his third wartime visit to the Middle East, meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah.
“The secretary will stress the need to sustain the increased flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza, secure the release of all hostages and improve protection to civilians in Gaza,” a senior US official said.
Blinken would discuss “the principles he laid out for the future of Gaza and the need to establish an independent Palestinian state,” the official added.
Inside Gaza, the health ministry said no fuel had arrived for generators at hospitals in the territory’s north, despite the truce.
And senior UN official Tor Wennesland warned the humanitarian situation “remains catastrophic”.
It “requires the urgent entry of additional aid and supplies in a smooth, predictable, and continuous manner to alleviate the unbearable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza,” the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process said.
Yesterday, UN expertscalled for investigations into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanityperpetrated in Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory on 7 October and thereafter.

A joint statement by Morris Tidball-Binz, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and Alice Jill Edwards, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture, said the investigations should be “prompt, transparent and independent”.
They called on Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the authorities in Gaza to cooperate fully with investigations.
“The duty to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity, including any act of summary or extrajudicial killing, torture or other outrages on human dignity, is a fundamental legal obligation.”
“There is no statute of limitation for such crimes, and they fall under universal jurisdiction, which means that courts in any country can exercise their authority to prosecute those responsible, regardless of their nationality and the country where the crimes were committed,” they said.
Meanwhile, the truce has allowed residents who fled fighting in northern Gaza to return to Gaza City, which has been ravaged by relentless Israeli bombardment.
People walked or bicycled along debris-lined streets, where the cars were flattened and buildings torn apart.
Gaza City Mayor Yahya al-Siraj said that without fuel, the territory could not pump clean water or clear waste accumulating in the streets, warning of a potential public health “catastrophe”.

The fighting has left many with devastating injuries, which doctors in Gaza have struggled to treat because of limited supplies.
Clean-up was under way at Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, which Israel targeted saying it was used as a command centre by Hamas – claims it denies.
“We hope it can soon resume its activities,” said Gaza health ministry spokesman Mahmud Hammad.
A limited number of Palestinians have been airlifted to the United Arab Emirates for treatment after crossing from Gaza to Egypt, including seven-year-old Yussef, who gnawed on his nails next to his mother Nouzha Fawzi.
“He was not like that before,” she said of Yussef, who suffers the blood disorder hemophilia.
“Since the war, he no longer speaks much. He is afraid of everything,” she added. “He asks me if he will die.”

Israel and Hamas agree two-day extension to Gaza truce as 11 more Israeli hostages freed,"LAST UPDATE|27 Nov 2023

A HUMANITARIAN PAUSE in fighting between Israel and Hamas will be extended by two days, mediator Qatar said today, as an initial four-day truce in Gaza was set to expire.
“The State of Qatar announces that, as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip,” Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari said on X, formerly Twitter.
Later, Qatar confirmed 11 Israeli hostages would be freed on the fourth day of the truce, among them three French, two German and six Argentinian dual nationals.
The Israeli military added: “Based on information that was received from the Red Cross, 11 hostages are currently on their way to Israeli territory.”
A total of 33 Palestinians in Israeli prisons – 30 minors and three women – were released, Ansari said.

Over the course of the humanitarian pause and in weeks prior, Qatar, with the support of the United States and Egypt, has been engaged in intense negotiations to establish and prolong the truce in Gaza, which mediators had said was designed to be broadened and expanded.
Including the 11 hostages set to return home today, a total of 50 civilian hostages, women and children, were freed by Hamas during the initial truce.
In exchange, 150 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel were released and humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza.
As a result of parallel negotiations led by the Gulf state, 17 Thais, one Filipino and one dual Russian-Israeli national have also been released by the Palestinian militants.
With just hours to go before the so-called “humanitarian pause” was to end early Tuesday, Hamas said that an agreement had been reached to prolong it by 48 hours under the existing terms.
There was no immediate confirmation from the Israeli side of the extension, which was nevertheless hailed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as “a glimpse of hope and humanity in the middle of the darkness of war”.
Qatar – with the support of the United States and Egypt – has been engaged in intense negotiations to establish and prolong the truce in Gaza.
Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari announced that “an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip.”
Hamas, which runs Gaza and triggered the latest round of fighting by launching a bloody cross-border raid last month, said it was drawing up a new list of hostages for release.

Meanwhile, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had informed families of the identities of hostages to be released today, the last day of the initial four-day truce.
Israel has been clear that the pause is designed to allow Hamas to free more of the hostages it is holding since the 7 October attack, which killed 1,200 Israelis including many women and children, according to Israeli officials.
But both sides are under pressure to build on the break in hostilities to allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza, where Israel’s campaign against Hamas has left almost 15,000 dead, mostly Palestinian civilians, according to Gaza’s Hamas government.
The Qatari announcement came after US President Joe Biden, top EU envoy Josep Borrell and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg all joined a global chorus urging the parties to extend their temporary break in fighting.
Tánaiste Micheál Martin also voiced his support for an extension to the truce.
In a statement today he appealed to “all parties to build on the important steps that have been taken and extend and expand this truce”.
He added that Ireland has “repeatedly called for a sustainable humanitarian ceasefire to be established” and that “Gaza’s civilian population cannot be allowed to suffer any further”.
Martin also said he was “delighted and relieved by the release of Emily Hand” and added that “it is our sincere hope that all remaining hostages will soon also be reunited with their friends and families”.
As part of the truce deal, Hamas has so far released 39 Israeli hostages, including Emily Hand, the nine-year-old Irish-Israeli girl who had been held hostage in Gaza since the 7 October attacks.She was released on Saturday night.

Israel has freed 117 Palestinian prisoners under the terms of the agreement.
In parallel, 19 foreign nationals have also been released by Palestinian militants.
Tearful reunions of families and hostages have brought relief from images of civilian death and suffering in the seven-week war.
“That’s our goal, to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief in to those in need,” Biden said Sunday.
The White House welcomed the agreement to extend the truce.
“We would of course hope to see the pause extended further, and that will depend upon Hamas continuing to release hostages,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
Kirby said that “in order to extend the pause, Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children.”

The EU’s Borrell had called for the pause to be prolonged “to make it sustainable and long lasting while working for a political solution.”
“Nothing can justify the indiscriminate brutality Hamas unleashed against civilians,” he said. “But one horror cannot justify another horror.”
Three successive days of hostage releases have buoyed spirits in Israel, with tearful reunions weeks after Hamas militants poured across the border on 7 October.
The third group of hostages released Sunday included a four-year-old American citizen called Abigail whose parents were both killed in the Hamas attacks.
Inside Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry complained that, despite the four-day pause, no fuel had been taken to generators in hospitals in the north of the Gaza Strip.
And Yahya al-Siraj, the mayor of Gaza City, complained that without fuel the territory could not pump clean water nor clear waste accumulating in the streets, warning of a potential public health “catastrophe”.
A French warship arrived in the Egyptian town of El-Arish near the border with Gaza to serve as a hospital for wounded civilians, a port source said.
Israel has faced mounting pressure to extend the pause mediated by Qatar, the United States and Egypt, though its leaders have dismissed any suggestions of a lasting halt to the offensive.
“We continue until the end — until victory,” Netanyahu said in Gaza on Sunday, on the first visit by an Israeli premier since 2005.
His office has proposed a war budget of 30 billion shekels ($8 billion) for 90 days.
Wearing military fatigues and surrounded by soldiers, Netanyahu vowed to free all the hostages and “eliminate Hamas”, in footage posted online by his office.

In another sign of mounting international concern, UN rights experts called Monday for independent investigations into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out in Israel and the Palestinian territories since October 7.
Morris Tidball-Binz, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, and Alice Jill Edwards, the special rapporteur on torture, issued a joint statement stressing the need for “prompt, transparent and independent investigations”.

Biden 'horrified' after three Palestinian college students shot in Vermont,"
AN AMERICAN MAN has been charged with attempted murder in Vermont over the shooting of three men of Palestinian descent, in a crime the US president Joe Biden has reacted with “horror” towards.
With the investigation in its early stages, Vermont state attorney Sarah George said there was not yet sufficient evidence to support a hate crime enhancement of the charges against the suspect, identified as Jason Eaton, 48.
But “I do want to be clear,” George told reporters in Burlington, the northeastern US city where the shooting occurred. “There is no question this was a hateful act.”
The attack — police said a gunman stepped off a front porch, “unprovoked,” and opened fire on the three college students as they walked together on a city block — occurred during high tensions in the United States over the Israel-Hamas war.
In a statement, Brown University President Christina H Paxson said one of the men had Irish links but it is unclear this evening what those links are.
College campuses and other locations have seen mounting threats and incidents of violence including acts of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.
The White House said President Joe Biden was “horrified” by the shooting of the three university students, who had gathered to observe the American holiday of Thanksgiving.
The attack also prompted anger and shock among several US lawmakers.
Eaton was arrested Sunday, and appeared before a judge in a Burlington court on Monday. NBC reported he pleaded not guilty to the shootings.
Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad described how law enforcement agents encountered Eaton when they knocked on his apartment door, and he responded by saying “I’ve been waiting for you.”
When the agents asked why, Eaton said “I would like a lawyer,” according to Murad.

Authorities searched the premises and retrieved a weapon and ammunition that matched the shells recovered from the scene of the shooting, the police chief said.
- ‘Domestic violent extremists’ -US Attorney General Merrick Garland warned Monday of increasing threats from “domestic violent extremists” amid growing attacks against minority groups, as he vowed a full investigation into the shooting, including whether a hate crime was committed.
“There is understandable fear,” Garland said, as the United States experiences a “sharp increase” in threats and attacks against Jewish and Muslim communities since October 7, when Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip launched a deadly raid on Israel, sparking a brutal war.
Burlington police had earlier described the shooter as a white man with a handgun.
“Without speaking,” police said, “he discharged at least four rounds from the pistol and is believed to have fled on foot.”
A police statement said two of the victims were in stable condition, and the third suffered “much more serious injuries.” It said two are US citizens and one a legal resident.
Two of the young men were wearing keffiyehs, the traditional black and white Palestinian scarf.
All three victims were graduates of the Ramallah Friends School, a private Quaker school in the West Bank, and are now attending different universities in the northeastern United States, according to a statement from a spokesman for the victims’ families.
The shooting came as civil rights groups have warned of a rise in hate crimes against Arab and Muslim Americans — as well as growing anti-Semitism.
The families have said they are devastated by the shootings. Richard Price, an uncle of one of the victims, and who was hosting the trio for Thanksgiving, told the Burlington press conference that “the families fear that this was motivated by hate.”
Radi Tamimi, an uncle of another of the victims, said his family was still in shock.
“Kinnan grew up in the West Bank and we always thought that that could be more of a risk in terms of his safety and sending him here would be, you know, the right decision,” Tamimi said.
“We feel somehow betrayed in that decision here and, you know, we’re just trying to come to terms with everything.”","7.56pm, 27 Nov 2023",,
Elon Musk visits Israel amid growing accusations of antisemitism on his social media platform X,"ELON MUSK HAS paid a visit to Israel, where he toured a kibbutz that was attacked last month by Hamas militants.
The billionaire has been under fire over accusations of antisemitism flourishing on his social media platform X.
Musk and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured the Kfar Azza kibbutz, a rural village that Hamas militants stormed on 7 October in a deadly assault that launched the war.
The entrepreneur, wearing a protective vest and escorted by a phalanx of security personnel as rain fell, used his phone to take photos or videos of the devastation, according to video released by Netanyahu’s office.
The Tesla chief executive and the Israeli Prime Minister visited the homes of some victims, including the family of Abigail Edan, a four-year-old girl with dual Israeli-US citizenship who was held hostage by Hamas after her parents were killed.
She was released yesterday in the latest round of exchanges during a ceasefire in Gaza set to expire after Monday.
Musk was also due to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Benny Gantz, a former defence minister who is now part of a special war cabinet in Israel.
Israeli Government spokesperson Eylon Levy declined to say whether Musk was invited or came on his own.

X, formerly known as Twitter, did not respond to a request for comment.
Israel’s communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, tweeted earlier on Monday about a deal that his ministry had reached with Musk’s Starlink satellite internet company.
“As a result of this significant agreement, Starlink satellite units can only be operated in Israel with the approval of the Israeli ministry of communications, including the Gaza Strip,” Karhi wrote, without providing further details.
Musk has faced accusations from the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil-rights organisation, and others of tolerating antisemitic messages on the platform since purchasing it last year, and the content on X has gained increased scrutiny since the war between Israel and Hamas began.
A slew of big brands, including Disney and IBM, decided to stop advertising on the platform after a report by liberal advocacy group Media Matters said ads were appearing alongside pro-Nazi content and white nationalist posts.
It came the same week Musk endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory that drew outcry, including from the White House.
Musk responded on X this month to a user who accused Jews of hating white people and professing indifference to antisemitism by saying: “You have said the actual truth.”
X has since sued Media Matters, saying the Washington-based non-profit manufactured the report to “drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp”.
Today’s visit is not the first time Musk and Netanyahu have met.
Netanyahu came to California in September, telling the Tesla CEO that he hopes Musk can find a way to roll back antisemitism and other forms of hatred within the limits of the First Amendment.","3.22pm, 27 Nov 2023",,
Irish ambassador 'surprised' at Israel's criticism over Taoiseach's Emily Hand statement,"LAST UPDATE|27 Nov 2023
THE IRISH AMBASSADOR to Israel expressed surprise at the Israeli government’scriticism of the Taoiseach’s statementin relation to the release of Irish-Israeli hostage Emily Hand.
Sonya McGuinness was summoned by Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen after he condemned Leo Varadkar’s use of the word “lost” in relation to nine-year-old Emily.
Today, at a meeting in Jerusalem, McGuinness reiterated the “full statements” from the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and “expressed surprise on the part of the Irish Government that these expressions of evident relief at Emily’s release had been publicly criticised by the Israeli Government”.
In a statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs said the Ambassador restated Ireland’s position that all hostages should be released immediately and unconditionally.
It said she also expressed “the importance of fully respecting International Humanitarian Law and getting desperately-needed humanitarian supplies to civilians in Gaza” and that “the current truce should become a sustainable humanitarian ceasefire”.
“The international community must focus on a pathway to deliver a two-state solution which can allow the people of Israel and Palestine to live in peace and security as neighbours.”
Upon the release of Emily Hand on Saturday night, Varadkar said onX, formerly Twitter:
“This is a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily Hand and her family. An innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned, and we breathe a massive sigh of relief.  Our prayers have been answered.”
In response to Varadkar’s tweet, Cohen said: “Mr Prime Minister, It seems you have lost your moral compass and need a reality check.
“Emily Hand was not ‘lost’, she was kidnapped by a terror organisation worse than Isis that murdered her stepmother. Emily and more than 30 other Israeli children were taken hostage by Hamas, and you @LeoVaradkar are trying to legitimise and normalise terror. Shame on you!”

In a later tweet, he confirmed that he had summoned McGuinness “for a reprimand”.
The Israeli President Isaac Herzoghas also criticisedthe use of the word “lost”, calling Varadkar’s statement “unacceptable”.
The issue and controversy has since gained international traction.
The tweet sent by Varadkar was the first lines of a lengthy statement, published by the Taoiseach, in which he detailed how Emily was “snatched from her home home and held captive for almost seven weeks”.

Varadkar also noted in his original full statement the fact that Emily spent her ninth birthday as a hostage.
Varadkarresponded to the controversyyesterday, saying: “It’s really good news that Emily has been released and she’s now at home with her family. The Irish government worked very hard with the Qatari, Egyptian, Israeli authorities, and the Red Cross to press for her release. And I’m really glad that she has been released and that’s the most important thing.
“I think the vast majority of people understand what I was saying, recalling the amazing joy and awe that occurs when a child comes home. I’ve always been consistent in my unequivocal condemnation of Hamas and hostage taking.”
He also called for all hostages to be released without any conditions “and I have always done so”.
Israelalso summoned ambassadors from Spain and Belgiumfollowing remarks from the countries’ leaders which criticised Israel in relation to the conflict in Gaza.
Members of Government and opposition parties have defended the Taoiseach in recent days.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland this morning, Higher Education Minister Simon Harris called the issue “a complete distraction” and said the country and the Government are “utterly elated” about the release of Emily Hand.
“The Government worked really hard with diplomatic partners in relation to this and I think anyone who reads the Taoiseach’s statement and indeed anyone who knows the Taoiseach’s record – of course he calls out terrorism. Absolutely.”
Asked if Varadkar had put further strain on Ireland’s relation with Israel, Harris said he did not believe he had.
“Israel have decided to summon a number of ambassadors from a number of European countries in recent days. It’s their prerogative to do that. I think it is a bit of an overreaction being honest,” he said.
“I think the Taoiseach’s statement was extraordinarily clear and the main thing is Emily Hand is back with her family.”
Speaking onRTÉ’s The Week in Politicsyesterday, Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty labelled the move as a “complete and utter deflection” from the debate around Israel’s siege of Gaza.
Doherty said: “Leo Varadkar statement is very clear. Emily Hand was taken hostage by Hamas. It has been condemned across the board, across the political divide and by the Taoiseach over and over again.
“This is absolute just deflection from from Israel, who are preparing I’m sure to begin their bombardment of Gaza again after the ceasefire.”
Asked on the same programme if the Taoiseach’s comments were “clumsy”, Minister of State Jack Chambers said Varadkar’s statement is “clear” in its reference to how Emily was taken.
Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore also said the comments about the Taoiseach are “disgraceful” and reiterated her party’s call to expel the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland.

Hamas releases 17 more hostages as 39 Palestinian prisoners freed,"
HAMAS MILITANTS HAVE released a third group of hostages including a four-year-old American girl with more Palestinian prisoners freed in exchange, as a source close to the group said it was willing to prolong a truce.
The transfers under a four-day ceasefire that started Friday have been the first relief for captives’ families since the militant group attacked Israel on 7 October, prompting devastating Israeli bombardments of the Gaza Strip.
Israeli officials said a total of 17 hostages were now back on Israeli territory.
United States President Joe Biden announced that among those freed is a four-year-old American girl.
“She’s been through a terrible trauma,” Biden said of Abigail, whose parents were murdered by Hamas militants in the unprecedented attacks.
Along with 13 Israelis, four others were released outside the terms of the truce – including one Russian-Israeli who Hamas said was freed “in response to the efforts of Russian President Vladimir Putin”.
Those freed were among around 240 captured on 7 October when Hamas fighters broke through Gaza’s militarised border with Israel in the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, killing about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners, according to Israeli authorities.
In response, Israel launched an air, artillery and naval bombardment alongside a ground offensive to destroy Hamas, killing nearly 15,000 people, mostly civilians and including thousands of children, according to the Hamas government in Gaza.
Today’s releases bring the total number of Israelis freed under the deal to 39 since Friday. In exchange, a further 39 Palestinian prisoners were freed, the Israeli prison service said.
This followed the release of 78 other Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails over the past two days.
A source close to Hamas said the Islamist movement, which has an armed wing, was willing to extend the current truce for up to four days beyond its initial expiry date.
“Hamas informed the mediators that the resistance movements were willing to extend the current truce by two to four days,” the source told AFP.
“The resistance believes it is possible to ensure the release of 20 to 40 Israeli prisoners” in that time, they added.
Four Hamas leaders killed
Under the terms of the truce, 50 hostages held by the militants are to be freed over four days in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners, with a built-in extension mechanism to prolong the process as long as at least 10 Israeli captives are released each day.
A Qatari operations team visited Israel to “coordinate with the parties on the ground and with counterparts in Doha to ensure the deal continues to move smoothly, and to discuss further details of the ongoing deal”, according to a source with knowledge of the talks.
Biden said today he hoped the truce brokered by Egypt, Qatar and the United States, would extend “beyond tomorrow”.
Israeli leaders have tempered hopes of a lasting halt to the offensive.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday:
“We continue until the end – until victory.”

Wearing green military fatigues and surrounded by soldiers, he vowed to free all the hostages and “eliminate Hamas”, in footage posted online by his office.
He spoke while making the first visit to Gaza by an Israeli premier since 2005.
“Nothing will stop us, and we are convinced that we have the power, the strength, the will and the determination to achieve all the war’s goals, and we will,” Netanyahu said.
In the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, residents received a text message from Israeli forces that said: “We know there are hostages being held in Khan Yunis. The army will neutralise anyone who has kidnapped hostages.”
‘That’s enough’
Elsewhere in Gaza, residents ventured back to pick through the ruins of their homes among heaps of rubble following weeks of bombardment.
“I came to see if there was anything left, if there was anything I could salvage. We fled with nothing,” said Oussama al Bass, inspecting the ruins of his home in Al-Zahra, south of Gaza City.
“It’s nothingness, everything is destroyed, everything is lost,” he said. “We’re tired. That’s enough. We can’t take it anymore.”
On the outskirts of Gaza city, families took to the road on foot to head south, pushing luggage and relatives in wheelchairs, and carrying children in their arms.
Hamas’s military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said that its northern brigade commander Ahmed Al-Ghandour and four other senior leaders had been killed, without specifying when.
Happiness at hostage release
In the previous round of captive releases, relatives voiced joy at the return of hostages including nine-year-old Israeli-Irish girl Emily Hand, and cheering crowds greeted Palestinian prisoners as they left a jail in the West Bank.
“We are overjoyed to embrace Emily again, but at the same time, we remember… all the hundreds of hostages who have yet to return,” her family said.
Among the group of Palestinians released earlier was 38-year-old Israa Jaabis, sentenced to 11 years in jail for detonating a gas cylinder at a checkpoint in 2015.
“I… have pain on an emotional level and I am missing my relatives. But this is the tax a prisoner pays,” she said after returning to her home.
Saturday’s releases went ahead despite a last-minute delay that highlighted the fragile nature of the process. Hamas had accused Israel of breaking the terms of the agreement. Israel denied the allegation.
Aid trucks enter Gaza
The pause in fighting has allowed more aid to reach Palestinians struggling to survive with shortages of water and other essentials.
Adnan Abu Hasna, a spokesman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), warned of “unprecedented” humanitarian needs.
“We should send 200 lorries a day continuously for at least two months,” he said.
Gaza civil defence spokesman Mahmoud Bassel called for deliveries of heavy machinery “to search for survivors and bodies and to clear the ruins”.
The UN estimates that 1.7 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been displaced by the fighting.","7.49pm, 26 Nov 2023",,
Varadkar responds after Israel summons Irish ambassador over his ‘lost and found’ comment in Emily Hand statement,"LAST UPDATE|26 Nov 2023
AN TAOISEACH LEO Varadkar has responded after the Irish ambassador to Israel was summoned by the Israeli foreign minister to be reprimanded over comments he made over the release of Irish-Israeli hostage Emily Hand.
Sonya McGuinness has been summoned by the Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed this afternoon.
Upon the release of nine-year-old Hand last night, Varadkar said onX, formerly Twitter:
“This is a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily Hand and her family. An innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned, and we breathe a massive sigh of relief.  Our prayers have been answered.”
In a reply to Varadkar, a spokesperson for the Israeli government Eylon Levy said: “Emily Hand wasn’t ‘lost’. She was brutally abducted by the death squads that massacred her neighbors.”
“She wasn’t ‘found’. Hamas knew where she was all along and cynically held her as a hostage. And Hamas didn’t answer your prayers. It answered Israel’s military pressure.”
The issue and controversy has since gained international traction.
The tweet sent by Varadkar was the first lines of a lengthy statement, published by the Taoiseach, in which he detailed how Emily was “snatched from her home home and held captive for almost seven weeks”.
Varadkar also noted in his original full statement the fact that Emily Hand spent her ninth birthday as a hostage.
In response to the controversy today, Varadkar said in a statement:
“It’s really good news that Emily has been released and she’s now at home with her family.

I think the vast majority of people understand what I was saying, recalling the amazing joy and awe that occurs when a child comes home. I’ve always been consistent in my unequivocal condemnation of Hamas and hostage taking.
Speaking earlier, a Government spokesperson said that the “Government has been clear at every stage that all hostages abducted by Hamas should be released immediately and unconditionally”.
McGuinness is expected to outline this position to the Israeli government during her meeting with the minister tomorrow. The Israeli Government on Friday also said it would summon the Spanish and Belgian ambassadors following criticisms made by those countries’ leaders on a two-day visit to Israel, the Palestinian territories and Egypt last week.
Original tweet
The remark made by Varadkar in his tweet is a reference to a New Testament Bible verse, Luke 15:24, about someone who was believed to be dead but actually was alive.
The verse reads: “For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.”
A clarification note below the tweet, from the community on Twitter, reads: “The terms ‘lost’ and ‘found’ are misleading.
“8 year old Emily was ‘lost’ when she was kidnapped from a kibbutz by Hamas terrorists. She was ‘found’ 50 days later when she was exchanged by Hamas for 3 Palestinian prisoners.”

Earlier today, on X, Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen said he will be summoning the Irish ambassador to Israel for a reprimand after what he labelled the “outrageous” words from Varadkar.

In a statement the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich said for a number of weeks Israel has been working with Irish counterparts who are all “happy to see the return of Emily Hand to her loving family”.
Erlich said: “Words matter, especially in war when lives are at stake, and when there is an increase of extreme discourse. It is important to remember Emily was kidnapped by terrorists who knew very well where she was all this time – in their hands.
“So too is still the fate for many Israeli men women and children who were kidnapped and are still held in Gaza. We continue to work and call for their immediate release,” she added.
Speaking on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics today, Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty labelled the move as a “complete and utter deflection” from the debate around Israel’s siege of Gaza.
Doherty said: “Leo Varadkar statement is very clear. Emily Hand was taken hostage by Hamas. It has been condemned across the board, across the political divide and by the Taoiseach over and over again.”
“This is absolute just deflection from from Israel, who are preparing I’m sure to begin their bombardment of Gaza again after the ceasefire.
“What we need now is a focus on it to make sure that Israel doesn’t do that, that this ceasefire is a lasting ceasefire and that there is space and opportunity for dialogue and for a peace process to emerge out of what we have in the last couple of days,” he added.
Asked on the same programme if the taoiseach’s comments were “clumsy”, Minister of State Jack Chambers said Varadkar’s statement is “clear” in its reference to how Emily was taken.
Chambers said: “I absolutely reject the assertion being made here and the complete misrepresentation of the taoiseach’s statement.
“Everyone as across the political divide, is delighted that Emily Hand has been returned to her family and Tom Hand, who brought dignity and determination to having her returned.
“But this has been completely misrepresented and I absolutely reject what has been set out. The taoiseach’s statement is very clear. If anyone reads it, in terms of people being taken from their home and held captive, and if you read anything else he has said as well – I think anyone everybody knows his integrity on this issue,” Chambers added.
The taoiseach met Emily Hand’s family and the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland last week where he pledged that he would use all channels of communication to pursue Emily’s release.
Varadkar spoke to the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, having previously raised Emily Hand’s case with the Palestinian Prime Minister, the Egyptian Foreign Minister and Prince Rashid of Jordan.
Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore said the comments about the taoiseach are “disgraceful” and reiterated her party’s call to expel the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland.
“I think the comments from the Israelis in relation to the taoiseach are disgraceful, but it’s not the first time that we’ve had them.
“We’ve hadcomments about what our president has said, we’ve have officials within the embassy saying that thatour government has funded Hamas.
“We cannot accept that kind of language and those statements to go out worldwide either and I think it’s really important that the taoiseach address this,” she added.
“The Social Democrats call for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, and we will reiterate those calls because it is really important they’re held to account for this language. We’ve seen nothing but propaganda during this this 50 days,” Whitmore said.

Emily had been on a sleepover in the Kibbutz Be’eri where she lived, when it was raided by Hamas last month. Thomas was initially told she had died in the attack.
Fifty of the 241 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza are to be released, under the terms of a ceasefire deal.
Thomas Hand added that he is looking forward to giving Emily a “huge hug” and told the newspaper that her beloved dog Johnsie and cuddly toys were waiting to greet her when she is released to the family.
The family are planning to give the young girl – who spent her ninth birthday in captivity – “the best birthday party she never had”.
Images released by the Israeli Defence Forces show that Emily has since been reunited with her father, who greeted her with a big hug.

Most of those held hostage were taken during the 7 October attacks in which 1,200 Israelis were killed.
Almost 50 days since she was taken hostage, Emily has been reunited with family in Israel.
The armed wing of Hamas said this evening that it had handed over 13 Israeli hostages to the Red Cross under the terms of an agreement with Israel, along with an additional seven foreign citizens.
The transfer – which had beendelayed after Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement, claims denied by Israeli officials – took place “in the context of the humanitarian pause”, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said in statement.
President Michael D Higgins, who earlier this month met with the Hand family and families of others who have been held hostage in 7 October, has said he hopes Emily can now “despite all that she has endured, enjoy a happy and fulfilling life”.
Higgins said: “The release of Emily Hand brings to an end what has been a horrific time for all of her family.
“May I send my best wishes to Emily, to her father Thomas and her sister Natali who I have met in recent weeks, and to all those who are close to her after what I know has been an extremely traumatic time.”
Higgins said the release of Emily to her family has been a priority of the Government in their diplomatic efforts in recent weeks, adding that he thought it was important to recognised the work of the team.
As reported byThe Journalearlier this month, a small team of Irish officials spread across the Middle East and in Dublin were working quietly and secretly through diplomatic channels in an attempt to rescue Emily Hand.
It was determined by the Israeli military, through gathered intelligence, that there was a strong possibility that Emily Hand was among the hostages taken.

Along with Emily Hand, President Higgins also met with the families of captured Shoshan Haran, and of Adi, Naveh and Yahel Shoham. It was announced that all four were also released yesterday.
Higgins said : “I also welcome the release of Shoshan Haran, and of Adi, Naveh and Yahel Shoham, whose relatives I also met with the Hand family.”
The full list of hostages released last night was posted to X, formerly Twitter, by the Israeli state account last night.

On X last night, Tánaiste Micheál Martin also welcomed the Shoshan Haran and Adi, Naveh and Yahel Shoham. Martin said he was “very pleased” to learn the news.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described“a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily Hand and her family”.
“An innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned, and our country breathes a massive sigh of relief. Our prayers have been answered,” he said.
“A little girl was snatched from her home and held captive for almost seven weeks. She spent her ninth birthday as a hostage. We hope she will soon heal and recover from the traumatic experience in the loving embrace of her family.”
He paid tribute to her family’s tireless campaigning for Emily’s release.
Tànaiste and Minister of Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said he was delighted that Emily Hand, who he described as a “bright and beautiful young girl”, has been released.
“After weeks of trauma, this is a precious and deeply moving moment for the Hand family. The people of Ireland have been touched by Emily’s story, her innocence and the quiet dignity and determination of her father, Tom,” he said, adding that he had met Tom before travelling to the region recently.
“I was struck by the strength and resilience with which he advocated for his daughter’s release. This is a message that I and my colleagues in government sought to amplify as we engaged internationally, through political, diplomatic and security channels, in a bid to secure Emily’s safe return.”
Martin also acknowledged the role played by the US, Qatar and Egypt in securing the release of hostages.
Echoing the Taoiseach’s words, he said: “I am conscious today that many more hostages remain in the hands of Hamas. I reiterate my call that all hostages in Gaza should be released immediately and unconditionally.”

Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald thanked the mediators after welcoming Emily’s release.
“The trauma and heartbreak that little Emily and her family have been subjected to over the last number of weeks is unimaginable,” she said in a statement.
“I commend the mediators’ efforts, including the government of Qatar and all other neighbouring states, for the constructive role that they have played in securing the release of Emily and the other hostages, as well as Palestinian women and children who were imprisoned under administrative detention, who are finally reuniting with their loved ones today,” she said in the statement, which also called for a full ceasefire.
In his statement, Higgins also renewedhis calls for a ceasefire.
“While we particularly recognise this important moment as an Irish-Israeli child is released we must also retain a focus on what is now needed – a durable ceasefire,” Higgins said.
“The release of all remaining hostages, and a commitment from all sides to engaging in the task of building what can be an enduring peace.”

Emily Hand - the 9-year-old Irish-Israeli girl held hostage by Hamas - has been released,"Emily (in pink) in a video released by Hamas (Screenshot: Al Jazeera)
EMILY HAND, THE 9-year-old Irish-Israeli girl who had been held hostage in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, has been released.
Confirming the news, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said “our country breathes a massive sigh of relief” and that “our prayers have been answered”.
Emily had been on a sleepover in the Kibbutz Be’eri where she lived, when it was raided by Hamas last month.

News of Emily's release on Israeli TV
The Journalunderstands Tom Hand has been told his daughter has been freed and he is currently waiting to meet her.
In his statement this evening, Varadkar said the past seven weeks have been “a slow and cruel torture” for Emily’s family.
Addressing the horror’s of her kidnap, he said, “A little girl was snatched from her home and held captive for almost seven weeks. She spent her ninth birthday as a hostage. We hope she will soon heal and recover from the traumatic experience in the loving embrace of her family.”
In the lengthy statement, he added: “We all recall the initial response from her father Tom Hand – the painful grief mixed with relief with the mistaken belief that his daughter had not been taken hostage, which turned into an ember of hope when it was discovered she was still alive.

“Throughout all these different emotions his love has been constant. Tom and Emily’s half-sister Natali turned that ember of hope into a flame by channelling their sorrow and campaigning tirelessly for Emily’s release. They travelled across Europe to keep her plight in the public eye. When I met Tom and Natali in Dublin, their pain was etched on their faces, but so was their courage and determination to ensure that Emily would be freed.
“Irish people everywhere share in the relief of Emily’s family. Our thoughts and prayers are with all the hostages in Gaza, but we followed particularly closely the fate of Emily, a dual Irish-Israeli citizen.
“Since our country first heard that she may still be alive, we have hoped beyond hope that her name would be on one of the lists of hostages to be released. Emily now returns to her family, but we cannot forget that many more hostages remain in captivity in Gaza.
“Their fate is unknown, but we hope that like Emily, they will also be allowed to return to their homes and their families. We think of all the families suffering in this troubled region, and we redouble our efforts to work for a permanent ceasefire, and for a just a lasting peace.”
Tànaiste and Minister of Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said he was delighted that Emily Hand, who he described as a ‘bright and beautiful young girl’, has been released.

“After weeks of trauma, this is a precious and deeply moving moment for the Hand family. The people of Ireland have been touched by Emily’s story, her innocence and the quiet dignity and determination of her father, Tom,” he said, adding that he had met Tom before travelling to the region recently.

Hamas frees first group of hostages as Gaza truce takes hold,"LAST UPDATE|24 Nov 2023
HAMAS TODAY FREED a first batch of hostages seized in the deadliest attack in Israel’s history under a deal that saw a temporary truce take hold in war-ravaged Gaza.
Thirteen Israeli hostages captured during Palestinian militants’ cross-border raids were back in Israeli territory where they would undergo medical checks before being reunited with their families, the army said.
They included four children and six elderly women, an official Israeli list showed.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to bring all the hostages home.
“This is one of the goals of the war, and we are committed to achieving all the goals of the war,” he said.
A convoy of Red Cross vehicles was earlier seen crossing the border between Gaza and Egypt, with some of the passengers waving, after Hamas handed over the hostages to the humanitarian organisation.
Israel is set to free three times as many Palestinian prisoners – women and teenage boys – under a deal that followed weeks of talks involving Israel, Palestinian militant groups, Qatar, Egypt and the United States.
Key mediator Qatar confirmed Hamas today released a total of 24 hostages and that Israel had freed 39 women and children from its prisons.

“Those released include 13 Israeli citizens, some of whom are dual citizens, in addition to 10 Thai citizens and a Filipino citizen,” its foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari said.
Hamas released a two-minute video later today showing masked militants wearing the green headband of its armed wing handing hostages over to Red Cross officials.
US President Joe Biden said today’s release was just a “start” and that there were “real” chances to extend the temporary truce in Gaza.
Speaking to reporters in Massachusetts, where he was spending the Thanksgiving holiday, Biden urged a broader effort to emerge from the crisis with a viable Palestinian state alongside Israel.
Pictures released by the Israeli army showed bright pink and blue headphones sitting on the seats of a helicopter ready for the released hostages to use, along with toys and teddy bears waiting at a reception centre where they were being taken.
Hamas broke through Gaza’s militarised border with Israel on 7 October to kill, according to Israeli officials, about 1,200 people and seize around 240 Israeli and foreign hostages.
During a four-day truce, at least 50 hostages are expected to be freed.

In exchange, 150 Palestinians prisoners are expected to be released.
Of the 39 prisoners released today, 28 were freed in the occupied West Bank, an AFP correspondent reported, while the other 11 were brought to annexed east Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club.
Those released in the West Bank were greeted by large crowds and fire crackers that lit up the night sky. In east Jerusalem, Israeli police issued orders banning celebrations.
“The police are in our house and are stopping people coming to see us,” said Fatina Salman, whose daughter Malak, now 23, was among those released.
It is believed Irish-Israeli nine-year-old Emily Hand is among the hostages in Gaza, captured by Hamas.
Some outlets yesterday reported that Emily was not expected to be among the first group of hostages released by Hamas today.
Speaking to RTÉ’s Prime Time last night in Tel Aviv, former Israeli diplomat Lasha Shakulashvili said: “These people will not be allowed to make comments to with the media. It’s very strict. They will be taken to medical facilities.”
Shakulashvili told the programme that the 50 hostages will include 30 children, 12 mothers and eight elderly women.
He added that it’s “very important” that Hamas fulfils this agreement, brokered by Qatari mediators.

The pause in fighting in Gaza triggered a mass movement of thousands of people who had sought refuge in schools and hospitals from relentless Israeli bombardment begun after attacks by Hamas militants.
“I’m going home,” Omar Jibrin, 16, told AFP after he emerged from a hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip where he and eight family members had sought refuge.
In Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza where many Palestinians fled, a cacophony of car horns and ambulance sirens has replaced the sound of war.
For Khaled al-Halabi, the truce is “a chance to breathe” after nearly seven weeks of war.
Israel’s retaliatory air, artillery and naval strikes alongside a ground offensive have killed about 15,000 people, most of them civilians, the Hamas government in Gaza said.
Gazans have struggled to survive with shortages of water and other essentials.
Trucks carrying aid, including fuel, food and medicine, began moving into Gaza through the Rafah crossing from Egypt shortly after the truce began at 7:00 am (05:00 Irish time).
A total of 200 aid trucks passed through today – the biggest humanitarian convoy to enter the besieged territory since the war started – according to the Israeli defence ministry body that handles Palestinian civil affairs.

Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency, OCHA, expressed hope that the pause “leads to a longer-term humanitarian ceasefire”.
The UN estimates that 1.7 million of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been displaced by the fighting.
In Khan Yunis, they loaded belongings onto carts, strapped them to car roofs, or slung bags over their shoulders, crowding streets to return to their homes from temporary shelters.
Israeli warplanes dropped leaflets warning people that the war is not over and it is “very dangerous” to return north, the focus of Israel’s military campaign.

Ziv Agmon, legal adviser to Netanyahu’s office, told reporters before the hostages were freed that they would be received individually or in groups by the Red Cross, taken across the border and handed to the Israeli army.
From El-Arish, in the Sinai, they would be flown to Israel, an Egyptian security source said.
Agmon said soldiers had been carefully prepared to receive potentially deeply traumatised women and children.
After medical examinations, the former captives will be able to telephone family members before reunions later at Israeli medical facilities, he added.
AFP has confirmed the identities of 210 of the roughly 240 hostages.
At least 35 of those seized were children, with 18 of them aged 10 or under at the time of their abduction.

Hamas earlier released four women and Israeli forces rescued another. Two other captives, including a woman soldier, were found dead by Israeli troops in Gaza.
Maayan Zin, whose eight- and 15-year-old daughters Ela and Dafna are among the hostages, posted on social media platform X that she had been informed their names were not on the list of those due to be released.
“This is incredibly difficult for me; I long for their return,” she wrote.

Lord Mayor of Dublin u-turns on decision to hold meeting with Israeli ambassador next week,"THE LORD MAYOR of Dublin has written to the Israeli ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich to cancel their planned meeting next week.
In the letter, which Daithí de Róiste shared on social media, the Lord Mayor states over the last number of days and following further discussions there is “no longer a consensus” among group leaders for the scheduled meeting to go ahead.
“Due to the ongoing violence in Gaza and a situation hat has a disregard for human rights and the need for a permanent ceasefire, all parties are united in the view that they no longer support the proposed meeting and we have therefore decided to cancel it,” the letter states.

The Lord Mayor wascriticised for agreeing to a meeting with Erlichwhich was due to take place on 29 November, what is the United Nations’ International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.
Following the criticism, de Róiste defended the decision to hold the meeting, stating that Erlich contacted the Mansion House for a meeting with him.
He said the matter was discussed a group leaders meeting (with leaders of all political parties and independents), where he expressed that he was happy to refuse this request, but he added that it was unanimously agreed to go ahead with the meeting.
However, in a u-turn today, the Lord Mayor has decided to cancel the meeting.
People Before Profit councillor Hazel de Nortúin criticised the initial decision to meet the Israeli ambassador calling it “absolutely disgraceful”.
In a statement toThe Journal, Sinn Féin councillor Daithi Doolan, leader of the Sinn Féin Dublin City Council group, said such a meeting would be “inappropriate”.

"Israel-Hamas ceasefire to begin tomorrow morning, Qatar says","A PAUSE IN the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza will start tomorrow morning with the first hostages to be released hours later, mediator Qatar said, after nearly seven weeks of fighting.
The truce is set to begin at 7am tomorrow local time (5am Irish time).
Families of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and of Palestinians detained by Israel were forced to wait an extra day after the breakthrough four-day truce deal was put on hold.
“The pause will begin at 7am on Friday … and the first batch of civilian hostages will be handed over at approximately 4pm on the same day,” Dr Majed Al Ansari, the official spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said.
He added that 13 people will be freed in the first group.
The Ministry also confirmed on X, formerly Twitter, that the list of hostages that will be released has been handed to the Israeli Intelligence Services.
Earlier, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi indicated the release of at least 50 Israeli and foreign hostages held by Hamas was still on track, but would not happen today as expected.
“The contacts on the release of our hostages are advancing and continuing constantly,” he said in a statement.
“The start of the release will take place according to the original agreement between the sides, and not before Friday.”
A Palestinian official told AFP today that the delay in implementation of the truce was due to “last minute” details over which hostages would be released and how.
The truce had been put back over “the names of the Israeli hostages and the modalities of their release”, said the official, who has knowledge of the negotiation process.
Speaking to Newstalk’s Pat Kenny Show, Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich said it is her understanding that “some technicalities” need to be agreed on before implementing the truce.
The complex and carefully choreographed deal saw Israel and Hamas agree a four-day truce, during which at least 50 hostages taken in the Palestinian militant group’s deadly 7 October attacks would be released.

Emily Hand
It is believed Irish-Israelinine-year-old Emily Handis among the hostages in Gaza, captured by Hamas – but it is not clear if she will be among those released tomorrow.
While there were reports carried by some outlets yesterday that Emily was on an official list of hostages to be released, no announcement has yet been made by the Israeli government regarding the identities of the first hostages expected to be freed.
Speaking to reporters this morning, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “It’s a rapidly developing situation and it’s hard to get accurate information from day to day and hour to hour.”
He said that “it is our understanding that there will be a four-day ceasefire from tomorrow”.
“That will allow 50 hostages to be released by Palestinian militant groups. We believe among those will be Emily Hand but that’s not confirmed at this stage,” Varadkar said.
“We’re certainly hoping that she’ll be at home with her father in the next couple of days,” he said.
Erlich said she is “hoping” for Hand’s release, adding: “I know how much the Irish people are worried and are praying with her family for her release.”
For every 10 additional hostages released, there would be an extra day’s “pause” in fighting, an Israeli government document said.
In turn, Israel would release at least 150 Palestinian women and children and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.

‘We are winning’
The agreement has been approved by Hamas leaders and by Israel – despite fierce opposition from some within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government.
Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir described the deal as a “historic mistake” that would embolden Hamas and risk the lives of Israeli troops.
Around 240 hostages were taken by Hamas and other Palestinian gunmen during bloody raids into Israel on 7 October, which also killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities.

Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
The attack prompted a blistering Israeli offensive into Hamas-run Gaza, which authorities there say has killed more than 14,000 people, thousands of them children.
Netanyahu has backed the agreement with Hamas, but vowed the truce will be temporary and will not end the campaign to destroy Hamas.

In Washington, the White House said President Joe Biden had spoken to Netanyahu yesterday and “emphasised the importance of maintaining calm along the Lebanese border as well as in the West Bank”.
The White House has pressed Israel not to escalate clashes with Hezbollah, for fear of sparking a war that could drag in US and Iranian forces.
UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron is in Israel today where he visited Kibbutz Be’eri, scene of some of the worst violence during the Hamas assault.

"Israel-Hamas ceasefire expected tomorrow, but release of 50 hostages won't begin before Friday","LAST UPDATE|22 Nov 2023
ISRAEL AND HAMAS have announced a deal allowing at least 50 hostages and scores of Palestinian prisoners to be freed while offering besieged Gaza residents a four-day truce after weeks of conflict.
In the first major diplomatic breakthrough in the bloodiest ever Gaza conflict, Palestinian militants are set to release 50 women and children kidnapped during their deadly 7 October raids into southern Israel.
However, the Israel national security adviser has tonight said that there will be no hostage releases before Friday.
It had been thought that hostages would be released in a staggered manner from tomorrow.
“We are very happy that a partial release is pending,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum group said in a statement today.
“As of now, we don’t know exactly who will be released when.”
It is believed Irish-Israeli,9-year-old Emily Handis among the hostages in Gaza, captured by Hamas. The identities of the 50 hostages remain unknown.
While there were reports carried by some outlets earlier today that Emily was on an official list of hostages to be released, no announcement has yet been made by the Israeli government regarding the identities of the first hostages expected to be freed.
In a statement toThe Journal,the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland said: “At this difficult time, we are not at liberty to give out any specific information.
“We are committed to the return of all the kidnapped and will continue to work tirelessly until they are all back home.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil today that he was hopeful Emily Hand would be among the hostages released.
Speaking more generally, Varadkar also said: “Sadly, the Israeli government doesn’t listen to us. I’m not sure if the Israeli government listens to anyone anymore. They used to listen to the Americans. I’m not even sure that’s the case anymore.”
At tonight’s Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting, Varadkar said the temporary ceasefire “offered a spark of hope to all”.
He said he hopes Emily will be released back to her family in the coming days and added that every effort is continuing to be made through diplomatic channels to ensure Emily’s release.
Meanwhile at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said the immediate priority for the government was the release of Irish Citizens in Gaza and Emily Hand.
He added that Arab states in the region were extremely supportive, particularly Egyptian authorities.
Martin also spoke about Lebanon and Irish peacekeepers stationed there and described the entire situation as very sensitive.
Israeli bombardment of south Lebanon yesterday killed eight people, official media said, including two journalists from Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen television, the broadcaster reported, in ongoing violence at the Lebanon-Israel border.

Martin said there is a need for the international community to redouble diplomatic efforts.
After weeks of Qatar-brokered negotiations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet approved the truce accord at the end of an almost all-night meeting, with the premier telling ministers this was a “difficult decision but it’s a right decision”.
The cabinet’s sign-off was one of the last stumbling blocks after what one US official described as five “extremely excruciating” weeks of talks.
Hamas welcomed the “humanitarian truce” and said it would see 150 Palestinians released from Israeli jails.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
The current conflict started after Hamas gunmen on 7 October launched the worst attack in Israel’s history that left around 1,200 people dead, most of them civilians, according to the Israeli government.
Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups also took an estimated 240 Israelis and foreigners hostage, among them elderly people and young children.
Israel declared war on Hamas, vowing to bring the hostages home and to destroy the militant group.
It launched a major bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza, which, according to the Gaza health ministry, has killed 14,100 people, thousands of them children.
Israel said that to facilitate the hostage release it would initiate a four-day “pause” in its air, land and sea assault of Gaza, while it stressed that the agreement did not spell the end of the war.
Israeli news outletHaaretzhas reported that the Israel-Hamas truce is due to begin at 10am local time tomorrow (8am Irish time).
For every 10 additional hostages released, there would be an extra day’s “pause”, the Israeli government said.
However, humanitarian and human rights organisations today said a four-day truce is too short and called for more time to deliver vital aid to the Gaza Strip.
Paul O’Brien, from Amnesty International USA, said on a conference call of major non-governmental organisations that the four-day truce was “not enough and it’s certainly not enough in human rights terms”.
Sources from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad group had earlier told AFP the truce would include a ceasefire on the ground and a pause in Israeli air operations over southern Gaza.
The negotiations have involved the US Central Intelligence Agency, Israel’s overseas spy agency Mossad, Egyptian intelligence, and leaders in Doha, Cairo, Washington, Gaza and Israel.
A senior US official said three Americans, including three-year-old Abigail Mor Idan, were among the 50 earmarked for staggered release.
US President Joe Biden said he was “extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls … will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented”.

Qatar’s foreign ministry confirmed the deal, saying that “a number of Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons” would be released in exchange for the hostages.

“The starting time of the pause will be announced within the next 24 hours and last for four days, subject to extension,” the ministry said.
Israel released the names of 300 Palestinian prisoners being considered for release, without specifying who might be freed in the first phase.
Among the Palestinians slated for release is Shrouq Dwayyat, convicted of attempted murder in a 2015 knife attack.
The deal has been welcomed by countries including Britain, China, France, Germany, Jordan and Egypt, where the office of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi touted the “success” of mediation by Cairo, Doha and Washington.
The Palestinian Authority also hailed the agreement while reiterating its call for “a comprehensive cessation of the Israeli aggression” and more aid deliveries, senior official Hussein al-Sheikh wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
Ahead of the Israeli cabinet vote, Netanyahu had faced criticism from within his right-wing coalition, some of whom thought the deal gave too much to the Palestinian militants.
Hardline Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir signalled he would vote against the agreement, saying it should include the release of Israeli soldiers also taken by Hamas.
But with dozens of families in Israel who are desperate to have their loved ones returned home, and the Israeli public gripped by the hostages’ fate, the government ultimately set aside any misgivings.

Israel’s hawkish Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said before the crunch meeting that he had won assurances that the deal would not spell the end of the war.
“Immediately after we have exhausted this phase”, security operations would “continue in full force”, he said.
The government underscored that Israel “will continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza”.
A US official said there was hope that the deal would lead to a “full pause” in deadly exchanges of fire along the Israel-Lebanon border with Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran.
Large parts of Gaza have been flattened by thousands of air strikes, and the territory faces shortages of food, water and fuel.
Israel appeared to continue its offensive in northern Gaza today, with witnesses reporting dawn strikes on Kamal Adwan hospital and nearby homes. A casualty toll was not immediately available.
Medical workers treated bloodied, dust-covered survivors as other residents fled through debris-strewn streets to safety.
Israel says Hamas uses medical facilities to hide fighters and as bases for operations, making them legitimate military objectives while insisting it does everything possible to limit harm to civilians.

Varadkar: 'I’m not sure if the Israeli government listens to anyone anymore',"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he is not sure that the Israeli government is listening to anyone, including US President Joe Biden.
Speaking during Leaders’ Questions today, Varadkar said:
“Sadly, the Israeli government doesn’t listen to us. I’m not sure if the Israeli government listens to anyone anymore. They used to listen to the Americans. I’m not even sure that’s the case anymore.

“They are, as President Biden said, at risk of being blinded by rage and as a sad reality that I’m not actually sure that any action or statement by us or the European Union or the US will change the current course of action they are on.”
He was responding to a Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns who said that Israel should not be congratulated for doing the “bare minimum” in allowing some humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Despite the Israeli government not listening, Varadkar said that “doesn’t mean that we don’t do the right thing”.
He said the Irish government has increase funding in humanitarian aid to Palestine as well as the International Criminal Court so it can continue its investigation into any potential war crimes that have been committed in recent weeks.

Ireland will continue to use its influence at EU and UN level, but reiterated that his view is that sanctions against Israel should be done on a multilateral basis.
The government today tabled a countermotion toPeople Before Profit’s motion on Israel, with Varadkar saying it is doing so because it omits reference to Hamas and the human rights abuses committed against Israeli citizens. The motion will be voted on later today.

Lord Mayor of Dublin defends decision to hold meeting with Israeli ambassador next week,"THE LORD MAYOR of Dublin has defended a decision to host the Israeli ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich at the Mansion House next week.
Daithí de Róiste was criticised by People Before Profit for inviting Erlich to the meeting on 29 November, what is the United Nations’ International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.
The party is calling for a protest to take place at the Mansion House on 29 November.
In a statement on social media, de Róiste said Erlich contacted the Mansion House for a meeting with him as Lord Mayor.
“I raised this at group leaders meeting (with leaders of all political parties and independents). I expressed that I was happy to refuse this request, or if it was the opinion of group leaders to go ahead with the meeting where we could collectively express our disgust with their actions of genocide in Gaza,” he wrote.
“It was unanimously agreed to go ahead with the meeting by all present and that group leaders of all parties and independents would join the meeting in the Mansion House. This was also minuted.”
People Before Profit councillor Hazel de Nortúin said it is “absolutely disgraceful” that de Róiste would host Erlich “while Palestinians living in Gaza are being bombarded daily, and having to endure apartheid conditions, ethnic cleansing, and genocide”.

“Ireland needs to lead the way on sanctioning Israel – by imposing boycott, divestment and sanctions on Israeli goods and services, and by expelling the Israeli ambassador and diplomatic staff,” the Ballyfermot-Drimnagh councillor said.

“I am calling on the Lord Mayor to cancel this meeting and join the call for the ambassador to be expelled, and for him to stand in solidarity with Palestine.”
In a statement toThe Journal, Sinn Féin councillor Daithi Doolan, leader of the Sinn Féin Dublin City Council group, said he would not be attending the meeting on 29 November.
“I will not be attending the meeting with the Israeli Ambassador. I realise that this date, November 29th, is the UN International Day of Solidarity with Palestine,” he said.
“I think it would be inappropriate to meet the Israeli Ambassador on this day considering what is happening in Palestine at this time. I have urged An tArd Mheara to seriously reconsider the invite.”
Dublin City Council Independent group leader Cieran Perry toldThe Journal: “On a personal level I would be willing to meet the Israeli ambassador as an opportunity to question her complicity in the ongoing genocide of the people of Gaza but I don’t believe it is appropriate to meet with her on the United Nations International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people.”
The Journalalso asked the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour group leaders for comment.
Last week, the Governmentdefeated a motionin the Dáil seeking to expel Erlich and impose economic sanctions on Israel.
People Before Profit have tabled a motion calling for sanctions on Israel and for Shannon Airport to be closed to the US military.
But the Government has tabled a countermotion to PBP’s motion, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar saying it is doing so because it omits reference to Hamas and the human rights abuses committed against Israeli citizens.
The motion is being debated in the Dáil this morning.

From the West Bank: 'Settler violence and military restrictions strangle Palestinian life',"THE NORMALLY BUSY main road of Huwara, a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank, is deserted but for a few Israeli soldiers stationed at intersections along the road. Children peer down at the road from balconies looking onto the road, unable to play outside.
Ramzi Farrah and his daughter wave down from their apartment balcony and invite me and another journalist into their home for coffee. The two had travelled from Gaza to the West Bank for medical treatment for the 7-year-old girl before the war began last month. Now, they have found themselves in a deserted town and cut off from the rest of their family in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.

Normally a bustling middle-class Palestinian town of 7,000 people and a commercial centre near Nablus city, Huwara has been a flashpoint for settler violence over the last two years with several hardline illegal settlements based nearby.
At the end of February, after two Israeli brothers were shot driving through Huwara, a mob of over a hundred angry settlers set fire to shops and cars, smashed windows and shot dead one Palestinian man in a night described as aPalestinian Kristallnacht.
Huwara is now facing a slow economic death. Since 7 October, when Hamas launched its bloody attack that left1,200 people deadin southern Israel, much of the West Bank has been under lockdown, with the movement of Palestinians living there heavily restricted.

An estimated 24 per cent of jobs have been lost in the West Bank since the war began, according to the UN, and many business owners have been told the restrictions will last as long as the war.
In Huwara, businesses on the main street have been closed for over a month while local residents are not allowed to cross the main road, from one side of the town to another – not even the mayor of Huwara Mo’een Dumaidi can cross without permission.

Along Huwara’s main street is the rubble where the Eiffel Bakery once operated as a busy pizzeria. On 13 October, the Israeli forces used a bulldozer to demolish the pizzeria after its Facebook account reportedly shared an advert with an image of one of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.

The owner published a post on Facebook an hour after the pizzeria was demolished apologising and saying the image had been posted without their consent.
Further along Huwara’s main street, a few people are harvesting olives from trees dotting the road. Olives are an important export for the West Bank but the harvesting season has become increasingly dangerous for Palestinians.

Some have suffered attacks at the hands of settlers while harvesting olives and a number have been killed. Earlier this month, Smotrich called for a ban on Palestinians harvesting olives close to illegal Israeli settlements and some settlers have damaged or uprooted olive trees owned by Palestinians.
Many families in Huwara have left for cities like Jenin, Nablus and Hebron – although parts of Hebron city are also experiencing a heavy-handed lockdown imposed by the Israeli military.
The house of Palestinian activist Issa Amro lies inside H2, a longstanding militarised zone inside Hebron, the largest city in the occupied West Bank. 1,000 extremist Israeli settlers live alongside the local Palestinian community in H2 who are subject to military law and heavy restrictions on their daily life that are now common across the West Bank since the war began.

Amro regularly hosts visiting groups of journalists and diplomats at his home where he explains the restrictions facing Palestinians living in H2. On 7 October, when the militant group Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israel from Gaza, Amro was violently attacked while he was returning home. He says he was surrounded by around a dozen people who were dressed in Israeli military uniforms. “Many of them are settlers in an army uniform,” he says.
Amro says he was then handcuffed with his hands behind his back, blindfolded and gagged for a ten-hour ordeal by the group who assaulted him. “I was beaten, kicked, pushed, threatened to be killed and threatened to be raped,” he says. “They were spitting on me all the time and settlers came and took photo selfies with me in that situation.” Amro showed photos of his hand with a severe indent and said his hands still haven’t recovered from having the blood flow restricted for ten hours.

Settlers clad in Israeli military uniforms attacking Palestinians is a relatively new phenomenon, says Ori Givati fromBreaking the Silence, an NGO supported by the EU and Trocáire where former members of the Israel Defence Forces campaign against the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory. “The settlers are doing literally whatever they want… they just terrorise Palestinian communities that are defenceless.”
The heavy restrictions placed on Palestinians in Huwara and H2 in Hebron have forced many to leave. “There is an official displacement policy in Gaza from the Israeli government and there is an unofficial displacement policy in the West Bank as well,” says Amro, who believes that the Israeli government is using the war to hasten settlement expansion and displace more Palestinians from their homes in the West Bank. According to the UN, 1,149 Palestinians have been forced to leave their homes since 7 October, as settler violence and intimation escalates across the West Bank.
A spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces said that in light of “a situational assessment” of the West Bank, “there are barriers as well as the monitoring of movement in various areas in the sector, including in Hebron.”
On Friday 20 October, he was violently evicted from his home on the basis that he had two guests. Michael Sfard, Amro’s lawyer, says that under international law a Palestinian living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank is a protected person and cannot be forcibly transferred by the Israeli authorities unless he poses an imminent and grave danger to others or in order to protect him from imminent danger from others – “this is not the case here – it’s a political act that was done to exploit the time of war.”

Sfard believes that the military commander for Hebron likely views the war as a good opportunity to stop Issa from hosting groups and the public recognition that comes with it – “Issa is a recognised human rights defender that is preaching non-violence and that is something that they don’t know how to deal with.”
As well as infringing on Palestinians’ freedom of movement, the lockdowns imposed on Palestinians – but not Israeli settlers – across the West Bank have had a devastating impact on the local economy, where already the average Palestinian earned 8 cents for every dollar earned by an Israeli citizen. During the first month of the war, the gross domestic product shrank by 4% in the West Bank and Gaza, sending over 400,000 people into poverty. The UN said that this is an economic impact unseen in the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine or in any previous Israel-Hamas war.
If the war continues for a second month, the UN estimates that the Palestinian GDP, which was $20.4 billion before the war began, will drop by $1.7 billion (8.4%). And if the conflict lasts a third month, Palestinian GDP will drop by 12%, pushing more than 660,000 into poverty.

Negotiations for truce agreement 'at final stage' as Israel PM says deal is 'right decision',"LAST UPDATE|21 Nov 2023

THERE IS HOPE that Hamas could release dozens of hostages from war-torn Gaza after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyah said a truce deal was the “right decision”.
Hamas’ leader and key mediator Qatar also said an agreement was in sight.
The announcements are the most optimistic yet of a potential breakthrough in the conflict, which has raged for more than six weeks and left thousands dead on both sides.
Netanyahu told a meeting of his cabinet that accepting a deal for the release of hostages taken in the Hamas attacks of 7 October was “a difficult decision but it’s a right decision”.
Netanyahu, who has vowed to destroy Hamas, said US President Joe Biden had helped to “improve the framework being laid out before you… to include more hostages at a lower price”.
“The entire security establishment fully supports it.”

Despite talk of a temporary truce, fighting raged on in Gaza’s bloodiest ever war, sparked by the 7 October attack in which Israel says Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized around 240 hostages.
In retaliation, Israel launched a relentless bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza.
According to the Hamas government, the war has killed more than 14,100 people, including nearly 6,000 children and close to 4,000 women.
The hostages’ families have demanded that Israel should insist on the return of all those being held, and the Religious Zionist party, which is part of Netanyahu’s coalition government, has voiced opposition to the deal, denouncing it as “bad” for Israel’s security, for the hostages and soldiers.
Here at home, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar this evening met with representatives of Islamic countries, as well as a group of Arab Ambassadors to Ireland to discuss the situation in the Middle East.
It is understood they discussed the case of Emily Hand, a nine-year-old Irish-Israeli girl who was taken hostage and is believed to be alive.
The Taoiseach at this evening's meetingSasko LazarovSasko Lazarov
Sources from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which also took part in the 7 October attacks, told AFP on condition of anonymity that the tentative agreement would include a five-day truce.
This would comprise of a complete ceasefire on the ground and an end to Israeli air operations over Gaza, except in the north, where they would only halt for six hours daily.
Under the deal, which the sources said could yet change, between 50 and 100 Israeli and dual-national civilians would be released in exchange for some 300 Palestinian women and children currently held in Israeli jails.
The agreement needs the backing of Israel’s war cabinet, security cabinet and cabinet. The first two meetings have been held, but the results have not yet been made public.

Hopes of a release deal have been mounting since Qatar on Sunday said only “minor” practical issues remained.
Ahead of the meetings, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh had said: “We are close to reaching a deal on a truce”.
In Qatar, foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said “we’re very optimistic, very hopeful” and told reporters: “We are at the closest point we ever had been in reaching an agreement.”
Biden, who does not support a full ceasefire, said a temporary truce was “now very close”.
“We could bring some of these hostages home very soon,” he said. “But I don’t want to get into the details of things because nothing is done until it’s done.”
The BRICS group of nations including Russia, India and China called for an “immediate, durable, and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities” in Gaza aimed at drawing up a common response to the conflict.
Rafah resident Hamza Abdel Razeq said a ceasefire would bring some respite for Gazans who have endured Israel’s bombing and expanding ground offensive.
“The people are really suffering,” he told AFP. “If they reach a five-day truce deal now, I believe it will pave the way for longer truces or even a total ceasefire.”

Another resident, Mahmud Abu Najm, added: “We… pray to God for its success because the people are enduring an unbearable situation.”
Large parts of Gaza have been flattened by thousands of air strikes, and the territory is under siege, with minimal food, water and fuel allowed in.
According to the Hamas and Islamic Jihad sources, the proposed deal would also allow for up to 300 trucks of food and medical aid to enter Gaza.
Israel has vowed to press on with its offensive, pledging to crush Hamas and ensure the hostages are released.
The Israeli military, meanwhile, said air strikes had hit “around 250″ Hamas targets in the past day, destroying three underground shafts in the Jabalia area, which it said it had fully surrounded.
Two soldiers were killed in northern Gaza, it added.
In the occupied West Bank, the health ministry said the Israeli army killed one Palestinian in Nablus.
In southern Lebanon, where exchanges of fire between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah have raised fears of a wider conflict, eight people including two journalists were killed Tuesday in Israeli strikes.
And in Iraq, a US strike killed multiple Iran-backed militiamen after they fired a short-range missile at American and allied forces in the country, the Pentagon said.
Medics and patients have been increasingly caught up in the fighting, as Israel expanded its operation across northern Gaza.
The Hamas-run health ministry said Israel had laid siege to and hit the Indonesian Hospital in Jabalia yesterday, killing dozens, but there was no independent confirmation of the toll.

The Israeli army said later its troops had “directly targeted” the source of fire from within the Indonesian Hospital.
Twenty-eight premature babies from Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, were taken to Egypt for treatment on Monday. Three others remained in southern Gaza, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday.
Two babies died before the evacuation, it said.

The Indonesian Hospital lies near Gaza’s largest refugee camp Jabalia, which has been the scene of intense Israeli bombing.
The health ministry official said there were still about 400 patients inside the hospital, as well as 2,000 people seeking shelter.
Around 200 people were evacuated from the hospital on Monday and bussed to the relative safety of a hospital in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said three doctors, including two it employed, were killed in an Israeli strike on the Al-Awda hospital in Jabalia refugee camp.
MSF said it has “regularly shared information about Al Awda as a functioning hospital” and added that “GPS coordinates were shared with Israeli authorities yesterday”.
MSF today reiterated its call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the protection of medical facilities and medical staff.
Israel says Hamas uses medical facilities to hide fighters and as bases for operations, making them legitimate military objectives, while insisting it does everything possible to limit harm to civilians.
But criticism of Israel’s conduct of the war has grown, from international agencies and some governments, with protests held worldwide.
The WHO said it was “appalled” by the strike on the Indonesian Hospital, calling it just one of 164 documented attacks on health facilities and workers since the war began.
The UN children’s agency, meanwhile, warned that fuel shortages and worsening sanitation in Gaza were shaping up to be “a perfect storm for tragedy” through the spread of disease.
Meanwhile, the owner of X, formerly Twitter, Elon Musk announced that X Corp will donate all revenue from advertising and subscriptions “associated with the war in Gaza” to both hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza.
Asked by an X user how the company can guarantee the money “won’t end up in Hamas’ hands”, Musk said they plan to track all funding, but “better ideas are welcome”.
“We should care about the innocent regardless of race, creed, religion or anything else,” he wrote.

Taoiseach hears views of Arab and Islamic reps at meeting about Israel-Hamas war,"LAST UPDATE|21 Nov 2023
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR this evening met with representatives from Arab and Islamic States to discuss the conflict in the Middle East.
He said they discussed the “deteriorating situation” that is the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as well as a plan to secure the release of Emily Hand, a nine-year-old Irish-Israeli girl who was taken hostage by Hamas during the 9 October attacks.
The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which had representatives at the meeting, is the second largest inter-governmental organisation in the world after the UN, comprising 57 States in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, South America, and Europe.
It’s understood that Varadkar thanked the Ambassadors in attendance for their countries’ support in helping Irish citizens leave Gaza.

Speaking after the meeting, Varadkar described it as “an opportunity to hear their views on the deteriorating situation in Gaza and the West Bank”, restating his support for the “scaling up” of humanitarian access, as well as an immediate ceasefire.
“The enormous number of civilian deaths is deeply shocking,” he said.
“International Humanitarian Law applies in all conflicts, in all circumstances, to State and non-State actors alike. Attacks on schools and healthcare facilities must cease.
“I particularly emphasised the need for us to work with our partners in the Middle East to deescalate the crisis, and turn our efforts back to securing a sustainable peace based on the two-State solution.”
Ireland last month voted in favour of a Jordanian-sponsored UN General Assembly Resolution which called for an “immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce” between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in Gaza.
The US and Israel were among 14 nations to oppose the resolution on 27 October, which is non-binding.
The UK, Australia, Germany, India, and Canada were among 45 nations to abstain from the vote.

Varadkar: 'We can’t continue to aid Palestine and trade with Israel in the way we've done in the past',"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has told the Dáil “we can’t continue to aid Palestine and trade with Israel in the way we have done in the past. That’s going to have to change in some way”.
During Leaders’ Questions, Varadkar was asked about what consequences Israel will face for their actions in Gaza in recent weeks.
In terms of sanctions, Varadkar said he is strongly of the view that they can only happen on a multilateral basis.
He said the whole point of imposing sanctions is to do harm to the country that’s being sanctioned and not the country imposing the sanctions.
Varadkar said that is why it should be done on a multilateral basis, but added that “we’re nowhere near that point” at European or international level.
The Taoiseach said he has said it before at European meetings, “we can’t continue to aid Palestine and trade with Israel in the way we have done the past. That’s going to have to change in some way”.
Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald said the South African government and others have referred Israel to the International Criminal Court, calling for Ireland to do the same.
The Spanish government and the Norwegian parliament “are moving to formally recognise the Palestinian State”, said McDonald.

“Ireland must do the same,” she told Varadkar.
She added that the Belgian government has called for sanctions against Israel, also stating that Ireland must do the same and reiterate calls for a ceasefire.
The Taoiseach went on to state that the Irish government is using all its contacts and abilities to ensure that if there is a hostage release in the coming days, that Emily Hand is one of the first to be released.
“That’s a major priority for us now as a government,” he said.
Tánaiste Micheál Martin said humanitarian workers have not been able to provide governments with the proof of life of any hostages believed to be held by Hamas, including nine-year-old Irish-Israeli Emily Hand.
Martin said the Irish government continues to work with Israeli and Egyptian authorities to get the remaining Irish citizens and their dependents out of Gaza.
Speaking to reporters in Dublin, he said: “The International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent have not had access to the hostages, I understand, in terms of verification and proof of life of any hostage – and that obviously remains a matter of deep anxiety for the families of all involved.”
He added: “Ordinarily, in theatres of conflict or wars they would get access to prisoners of war camps, for example.”
Martin said there has been no further information with respect to any individual hostage, adding: “Not least Emily Hand.”
Asked about the release of bodies, he said there has been “no indication of that yet”.

But he said “the bones of an agreement” on the release of hostages by Hamas exists.
“We want all hostages released. We have raised the case of Emily Hand with all of the key governments and agencies which may have influence and channels with people who could affect the release of hostages and particularly Emily Hand,” Mr Martin said.
“We have prioritised the release of children and older people and that is our focus. I hope and I pray that Emily Hand will be freed along with other hostages.
He added: “We know that the bones of an agreement is there. I think what we’re all waiting for now is the realisation of it and the release of hostages.”
Martin said “the majority” of Irish citizens have left Gaza but some are not “in a position” to leave due to personal circumstances.
People Before Profit Richard Boyd Barrett asked the Taoiseach today: “When are you going to act?” He said Ireland has responsibilities under the Genocide Convention, stating that in his view, it is a textbook case.
“I think what’s happened to the Palestinian people for the past 75 years is shameful, is appalling.’ He says the international community, the West and the Arab world have ‘let them down extremely badly, and that’s putting it way too mildly,” Varadkar replied.

Premature babies evacuated to Egypt as Gaza's health ministry says 12 killed in hospital strike,"LAST UPDATE|20 Nov 2023

TWENTY-EIGHT PREMATURE babies were evacuated from war-devastated Gaza to Egypt today, as the Hamas-run health ministry accused Israel of a deadly strike on the territory’s Indonesian Hospital.
While fighting raged, negotiators worked to seal a deal for the release of some of the roughly 240 hostages the Islamist militants took during their unprecedented 7 October attacks on Israel.
The Gaza health ministry charged that Israel’s army killed at least 12 people in the strike on the Indonesian Hospital in the Palestinian territory’s north, where entire city blocks have been reduced to rubble.
Those killed included patients, said Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the ministry.
Hamas authorities have reported a total death toll of more than 13,300, mostly civilians, from the Israel-Hamas war now in its seventh week.
Late today, Qudra said about 100 patients had so far been evacuated from the Indonesian Hospital, in coordination with the Red Cross.
Hundreds remained inside but efforts continued to move them to hospitals in southern Gaza, Qudra added.
Israel did not immediately comment.
The military pushed on with its withering air and ground campaign aimed at destroying Hamas in response to the 7 October attacks that officials said killed around 1,200 people, when the militants broke through Gaza’s militarised border.
“We are witnessing a killing of civilians that is unparallelled and unprecedented in any conflict since I am Secretary-General,” said United Nations chief Antonio Guterres.

More than 2.4 million Palestinians are trapped in Gaza and only several hundred war-wounded, foreign nationals and dual passport holders have been allowed out.
The UN World Health Organization today said 28 premature babies evacuated from Gaza’s biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, had been taken to safety in Egypt through the Rafah crossing, revising down by one a number given by Egyptian media.
“All babies are fighting serious infections and continue needing health care,” the WHO said, while the Israeli army said it had “helped facilitate” the transfer.
In Israel’s commercial centre, Tel Aviv, the families of Israeli children held hostage by Hamas were among hundreds of people who demonstrated outside the UN children’s fund, which they urged to speak out for their release.

Yoni Asher, whose daughters, four-year-old Raz and Aviv, 2, are among the captives, called on UNICEF to make a public stand about Israeli children “like you refer specifically to babies on the other side”.
Air raid sirens warning of incoming Hamas rockets suddenly interrupted the demonstration, sending some people running for shelter as others flung themselves onto the ground.
US President Joe Biden today said he believes a deal to free hostages in Gaza is close. “I believe so,” he said during a White House ceremony.
The Red Cross said its president had travelled to Qatar to meet with Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, and separately with officials in the emirate which has helped broker talks on the hostages.

Israel, backed by the United States, argues that Hamas has used vast tunnel networks below Al-Shifa for military purposes. It has shown recovered weapons, and on Sunday said it had uncovered a 55-metre tunnel.
It also released CCTV footage it said showed two male hostages being brought into the facility.
The militants and medical staff have denied that a command centre is under the hospital, and Israel has yet to reveal evidence of a major military headquarters below ground.
The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) charity said today on X, formerly Twitter, that its Gaza City clinic had come under fire “as heavy fighting took place all around it. An Israeli tank was seen in the street.”
Twenty-one people inside are “in extreme danger”, MSF said.
Alarm has surged over the dire humanitarian situation across Gaza where cold autumn rain has deepened the misery by soaking families living in tents and turning dust to mud.
The WHO warned of spreading sickness with 44,000 cases of diarrhoea and 70,000 acute respiratory infections registered in shelters.
With a majority of Gaza’s hospitals no longer functioning, the territory today received from Jordan what Palestinian officials said is the first field hospital since the war began.
It has a 41-bed capacity, the Jordanian royal palace said.
Israel has told Palestinians to move from north Gaza for their safety, but deadly air strikes have continued to hit central and southern areas.
Families walked along cracked roads as gunshots and explosions rang out in the distance.

“It’s like the apocalypse,” said one tearful woman, Renad al-Helou.
“We are tired. There’s no water, no food… There’s nothing left in Gaza. There’s only destruction, suffering and torture.”
A senior Israeli military official today told reporters that if the army wants to take out Hamas’s firepower, “we have to go to the south. We cannot do it without” going there.
The Gaza war has sparked fears of a wider conflagration in the Middle East where Israel has long faced arch-enemy Iran and its allies.
Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, allied with Hamas, said it today targeted troops in northern Israel with drones, artillery and missiles, claiming a string of new attacks.
In response to missile launches from “a terrorist cell”, Israel’s military said tanks, a fighter jet and a helicopter struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.
Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels on Sunday said they had seized in the Red Sea a cargo ship with links to an Israeli businessman.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the vessel “was hijacked with Iran guidance by the Yemenite Huthi militia”, an allegation Iran rejected.
During a meeting today with European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, Jordan’s King Abdullah II called for a ceasefire in Gaza and an “end to the siege”.
He warned of the “catastrophic effects of the ongoing heinous war, which is killing innocent, defenceless civilians”, as well as rising settler violence in the occupied West Bank.
Israel has refused to heed calls for a ceasefire before Hamas releases all the hostages.
South Africa, long a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, will on Tuesday host a virtual summit of the BRICS group of nations to discuss the Israel-Hamas war.
On the eve of the event Israel’s foreign ministry said it had recalled for consultations its ambassador to Pretoria.

Babies evacuated from Al-Shifa receive urgent care; remaining patients in ‘desperate’ situation,"LAST UPDATE|19 Nov 2023

THIRTY ONE PREMATURE babies have been evacuated from Gaza’s biggest hospital, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said, seeking to get the last patients and staff out of what it has described as a “death zone”.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organisation led a second joint-humanitarian mission to Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza “under extremely intense and high risk security conditions” following the first mission yesterday.
He said that 31 “very sick” babies were moved in a joint operation with staff from the UN and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PCRS), which used six ambulances in the transfer.
The babies were taken to the Al-Helal Emirati maternity hospital, he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “They are receiving urgent care in the neonatal intensive care unit,” he added.
An AFP photographer saw the tiny infants at the hospital, some three or four to a cot, being bottle-fed by nurses and tended to by doctors in surgical scrubs.
“Further missions are being planned to urgently transport remaining patients and staff out of Al-Shifa Hospital, pending guarantees of safe passage by parties to the conflict,” said Tedros.
Alongside the babies, six health workers and 10 staff family members were also moved, he added.

The evacuation came as Israel said it was stepping up operations against Hamas militants and mediator Qatar said only “minor” obstacles remained to getting agreement on the release of hostages.
Sirens blared across Jerusalem to warn of rocket fire from Gaza, sending civilians scurrying for cover as loud blasts from intercepted missiles pierced the air.
In Gaza, a lack of fuel to power incubators has previously led to the deaths of other vulnerable newborns at Al-Shifa hospital, according to the Gaza health ministry in the territory.
Al-Shifa has become the focus of the six-week-old war that began 7 October when Gaza-based Hamas militants stormed across the militarised border to kill, according to Israeli officials, around 1,200 people and take roughly 240 hostages.
In Gaza, the Hamas government says 13,000 have now been killed in Israel’s relentless aerial bombardment and ground operations in retaliation for the worst-ever onslaught against the country.
The Hamas government said more than 5,500 children were among the dead, alongside 3,500 women, with 30,000 more people wounded.
Most of the casualties on both sides are civilians.
Israel said yesterday its military was “expanding its operational activities in additional neighbourhoods… of the Gaza Strip” where the United Nations says some 1.6 million people have been internally displaced by weeks of fighting.
Three Israeli soldiers were killed yesterday in fighting in northern Gaza, the military said, raising the number of troop deaths to 62 since the war began.
The narrow coastal territory, under a crippling blockade since Hamas took power in 2007, has been under Israeli siege since the war erupted, leaving food, water, medicine and fuel in short supply.

The fighting has rendered more than half of Gaza’s 36 hospitals non-functioning by shortages, combat or damage, the UN has said.
Yesterday, hundreds fled Al-Shifa Hospital on foot as loud explosions were heard around the complex. Columns of sick and injured were seen leaving with displaced people, doctors and nurses.
At least 15 bodies, some in advanced stages of decomposition, were strewn along the route, an AFP journalist said.

The WHO said 29 patients at the hospital with serious spinal injuries cannot move without medical assistance.
Israel has told Palestinians to move south for their safety, but deadly strikes continued there too.
At least 26 people were killed in a strike that hit a residential building yesterday, according to the director of the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis.
Israeli troops raided Al-Shifa Hospital earlier this week on suspicion that it was being used as a Hamas base.
Israel has been under pressure to prove its allegations that a Hamas command centres is concealed beneath the hospital, a claim denied by the group and medical staff.
“We already discovered evidence. We’re going to show more evidence today of tunnels,” Israel’s ambassador to Washington, Michael Herzog, told ABC News.
The WHO described the hospital as a “death zone”, with a mass grave at the entrance and 291 patients left inside with 25 health workers.
In a statement shortly before midnight last night, Irish time, the WHO said the situation in the hospital was “desperate”, and signs of shelling and gunfire were evident.
“Lack of clean water, fuel, medicines, food and other essential aid over the last six weeks have caused Al-Shifa Hospital—once the largest, most advanced, and best equipped referral hospital in Gaza—to essentially stop functioning as a medical facility,” the WHO said.
“The team observed that due to the security situation, it has been impossible for the staff to carry out effective of waste management in the hospital. Corridors and the hospital grounds were filled with medical and solid waste, increasing the risk of infection.
It said it was planning “the immediate evacuation of the remaining patients, staff and their families”.
But it warned that nearby facilities were already overstretched and urged an immediate ceasefire given the “extreme suffering of the people of Gaza”.
Al-Shifa head of surgery Marwan Abu Sada told AFP that Israeli troops were still in the hospital and it was surrounded by tanks.
“I heard at least two explosions since this morning,” he said.

Doctors said Israeli troops were going from building to building and regularly detonated explosives on the ground floors and hospital basements searching for Hamas tunnels.

A Gaza health official said more than 80 people were killed on Saturday in twin strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, the territory’s largest, including on a UN school sheltering displaced people.
The Israeli army said only that “an incident in the Jabalia region” was under review without elaborating.
“The horrendous events of the past 48 hours in Gaza beggar belief,” United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a statement, referring to actions “which fly in the face of the basic protections civilians must be afforded under international law.”
With just a trickle of aid allowed in from Egypt, Israel permitted a first consignment of fuel to enter Gaza late Friday under US pressure, allowing telecommunications to resume after a two-day blackout.
Some 120,000 litres of fuel arrived today, according to the UN.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government had vowed to keep aid out of Hamas’s hands, said the fuel would power basic necessities like water pumps and sewage systems to prevent disease outbreak.
“The humanitarian assistance is also vital to ensure continued international support,” he told a news conference.
A US official has said more fuel deliveries and a “significant pause” in fighting would come “when hostages are released”.
The White House denied a Washington Post report of a tentative agreement.
But Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said today that a deal to free hostages hinges on “very minor” practical issues, without elaborating.
US deputy national security advisor Jon Finer told NBC they were “closer than we have been in quite some time” to securing a deal.
But he added on CBS: “The mantra that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed really does apply.”
Relatives of some of the hostages yesterday marched to Netanyahu’s Jerusalem office, demanding action to free them.
The bodies of two female hostages were recovered in Gaza this week, the Israeli military said, while four abductees have so far been released by Hamas and a fifth rescued by troops.
US President Joe Biden threatened sanctions against Israeli settlers who have ramped up attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank in recent weeks.
Since the Israel-Hamas war began, Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 200 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the health ministry in Ramallah.

Israeli army says 55-metre tunnel found under Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital,"
THE ISRAELI MILITARY has said it has uncovered a tunnel under Gaza’s Al-Shifa hospital that stretched 55-metres beneath the complex where troops have been conducting a major operation.
“IDF troops exposed a 55-meter-long terror tunnel 10 metres deep underneath the Shifa hospital complex,” which ran under the hospital and ended at a blast door, an army statement said.
Al-Shifa, Gaza’s largest hospital, has become the focus of the six-week-old war that began 7 October when Gaza-based Hamas militants stormed across the militarised border to kill, according to Israeli officials, around 1,200 people and take roughly 240 hostages.

"Shannon Airport not being used by US to facilitate Israel, Taoiseach says","TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said Shannon Airport is not being used by the United States to transport military supplies to Israel.
His comments come ahead of a People Before Profit motion due this week in the Dáil in relation to the matter.
Speaking on RTÉ’s This Week in Politics programme today the Taoiseach said categorically that the airport was not being used to facilitate the war in Gaza “or any war for that matter”.
“You have to receive express permission to bring munitions through any airport in Ireland, and they have to be signed off on by the Department of Transport and the Minister for Transport,” the Taoiseach said.
Double standard
Speaking about the war more generally, the Taoiseach said he agrees with some members of the opposition that there is a “double standard” in Europe and internationally when it comes to Israel’s actions in Gaza and Russia’s actions in Ukraine.
He said however that he does not believe this is the case in Ireland.
“I don’t think that’s true in relation to Ireland. If they’re saying that in relation to the European Union, and some Western powers, I think they’re correct. And I made that point at the Peace Conference in Paris that there can’t be double standards when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine,” the Taoiseach said.
“And that when it comes to international humanitarian law, it has to apply across the board,” he added.
The Taoiseach said one of his concerns is that the double standards being applied by some countries in the West is undermining the fight in Ukraine.

“One of the things that I’ve been working very hard on and European leaders have been working very hard on is to gain support for Ukraine, across the Global South.
“From Africa, from Latin America, from Asia. Saying to them that what’s happening in Ukraine is a war of aggression. It’s an imperialist war. You should be against it,” he said.
The Taoiseach added that the double standards from “a lot of Western powers has underminded that fight”.
‘We need to slow the flow’
On the number of Ukrainian refugees who have been welcomed in Ireland, the Taoiseach said Ireland needs to reduce the number of new arrivals.
Over 100,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Ireland since the outbreak of Russia’s war with Ukraine in 2022.
The Taoiseach said he is “really proud” of this but that there is only so many additional people a country can handle.
“I do think we need to slow the flow. Migration is a good thing for Ireland. I don’t want anyone to misunderstand me in that regard,” he said.
“There’s only so many additional people that any country can manage in any given year. So I think when it comes to people who are coming to Ireland for economic reasons, we control it in terms of the number of work permits and work visas we issue, we do that already.
“When it comes to irregular migration – that’s people coming from Ukraine or people seeking international protection – I think one of the things we have to do, and we have to be honest with each other about this is to make sure that what we offer in terms of accommodation, in terms of work, in terms of money is similar to what’s offered in other Western countries,” the Taoiseach said.
He added that Ireland should not be encouraging secondary movers – people who have arrived in one country seeking protection before moving to another – and said that Ireland needs to align with what is being offered in countries like the UK, France and the Netherlands.

"Brian Rowan on the Middle East 
 Where have all the leaders gone?","WHEN YOU THINK back into this time 30 years ago, there was no certainty about peace in the North.
On the calendar of 1993, as October turned into November, the headlines from here were about the rubble and the graves of war; about the trauma and the convulsions of conflict.
It was a crisis year. No hope, or so it seemed.
We had just experienced another of those weeks when we counted the dead from the IRA bomb on the Shankill Road in Belfast through to the pub killings at Greysteel, where loyalists took their revenge.
The late Mo Mowlam.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
We remember those headlines, but not so the forgotten dead of that week – the other lives lost in between one Saturday and then the next: Martin Moran, Sean Fox, James Cameron, Mark Rodgers, Gerard and Rory Cairns.
The days that are more easily recalled are those on which there were multiple deaths when we were shocked into thinking.
In my book ‘Living With Ghosts’ (a personal reflection on reporting the conflict), I wrote: “When it lasts so long, you get used to war. You can become almost indifferent, detached. Not uncaring, but, at times, not caring enough.”
Back in 1993, the then SDLP leader John Hume was vilified for talking with Sinn Féin and with Gerry Adams and for daring to think that there was another way that could be shaped in dialogue and negotiations; that guns could be silenced. That peace was possible.
We learned at that time that conflict happens on two stages – one that you see. And on another that is hidden.

In November 1993, the story emerged of secret contacts between the British Government and the IRA leadership; that quietly, through a backchannel, they too had begun some exploration of another way.
Albert Reynolds, Bertie Ahern and John Hume.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
It caused an earthquake in the unionist/loyalist community. They sensed a sell-out.
Just days earlier, a huge arms shipment was caught before it arrived in Northern Ireland.
This place was still at war.
Yet, within a year, the IRA and the Combined Loyalist Military Command, had announced ceasefires that were a long beginning towards ending the long wars.
Hume and Adams were right. There was another way; and, in those developments, our learning was that before you can have peace, the trenches are dug even deeper.
Part of our journey was the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.

They are no longer with us.

Recently, I asked the question: Where have all the leaders gone?
Asked it at a moment when ceasefire has become a bad word, and when too many leaders of influence are looking the other way as we count the dead in Israel Gaza war.
Thirty years on, with all of the advances in technology, there is nowhere to hide from this conflict.
Since the Hamas attacks on 7 October, in every minute, of every day, we can see the dead – witness the horror and the anguish and listen to a commentary about humanitarian pauses and proportionate responses.
My question is the same. Where have all the leaders gone?
We needed help. From Nelson Mandela and President Clinton. From the former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa.

Is there such a thing as destroying Hamas without destroying Gaza?
The young and the old – their homes, the hospitals. Is that a proportionate response?
We are long past the point of humanitarian pauses.

Surely not the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu.
It has to be someone who can see beyond the understandable rage that resulted from the murders and evil and the hostage taking of 7 October.
In the North, we are visited by delegations from conflict zones across the world who come in search of our peace formula – as if it is some magical potion in a corked bottle.

There is no such thing.
What we have is some learning. Hard learning, often from mistakes.
What we know is that ceasefires are an essential starting point.
Living With Ghosts by Brian Rowan.
That peace is not surrender, and nor is it victory by one side over another.
That it is not pure. For some, it’s not fair.
You can’t bring back the dead.
For those touched by the worst horrors of conflict, it is not the Past, but always the Present.

And peace is a negotiation. Always a work in progress.
Here, politics – Stormont – has been the biggest failure of the 25-year process since Good Friday 1998.
In some places, so-called ‘peace walls’ still divide our communities.
There is a legacy war – a continuing narrative battle over the Past.
But we are in a better place, because Hume and others believed.

THERE WERE EMOTIONAL scenes in Dublin Airport this afternoon as Irish-Palestinians who fled Gaza arrived from Egypt.
Their arrival comes following confirmation from the Department of Foreign Affairs this morning that an additional 24 Irish citizens and dependents left Gaza via the Rafah crossing last night.
In a statement the Department said this brings to 50 the number of Irish citizens and dependants assisted to leave Gaza in recent days.
The statement read: “Only small numbers of citizens or accompanying dependants who have expressed a wish to leave remain in Gaza.
“The Department remains in contact in each case and will continue to work consistently with the relevant authorities to ensure they are able to leave Gaza as soon as possible.”
This morning’s news comes after Tánaiste Micheál Martin said that 25 Irish citizensmade the journey to the Rafah border crossing yesterday.
The Journalhas asked the Department for Foreign Affairs why only 24 citizens were confirmed to have crossed out of Gaza.
A spokesperson for the Department said it does not comment on the detail of individual cases.

Speaking in Maynooth this afternoon at the Fine Gael special conference, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said individuals who travelled through the Rafah crossing last night are in Egypt now and are being provided with help and support.
He said Ireland is continuing to work hard at EU and United Nations level to call for a ceasefire and said this would need to be onserved by all sides, not just Israel.
“It has to be observed by Hamas, which started this phase of the conflict and by Islamic Jihad as well. That’s why we’re calling for a ceasefire so that the killing can stop, so that hostages can be released, so that we can get humanitarian aid in and then to begin at some point, talks about peace again.
“Israel and Palestine came close to peace on at least three occasions in my lifetime. That may seem ridiculous now, but you can never give up hope for peace,” the Taoiseach said.

Gaza health ministry says more than 80 dead in strikes on refugee camp,"
A GAZAN HEALTH official has said that more than 80 people have been killed in twin strikes on a northern Gaza refugee camp, including a UN school used as a shelter for people displaced by the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Social media videos – which AFP was unable to immediately verify – showed bodies covered in blood and dust on the floor of a building, where mattresses had been wedged under school tables in Jabalia, the Palestinian territory’s biggest refugee camp.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the 7 October attacks which Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians in southern Israel, and saw about 240 people taken hostage.
The army’s relentless air and ground campaign has since killed 12,000 people, including 5,000 children, according to the Hamas government which has ruled Gaza since 2007.
“At least 50 people” were killed in an Israeli strike at dawn on the UN-run Al-Fakhura school in the camp, which had been converted into a shelter for displaced Palestinians, an official at Gaza’s health ministry told AFP.

Horrifying#Gazahttps://t.co/oflenK5Dzl
In a post shared on social media this afternoon, the Commissioner General of the UN agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini said he was receiving “horrifying images and footage” of “scores of people killed and injured” in the UN-run school.
“These attacks cannot become commonplace, they must stop. A humanitarian ceasefire cannot wait any longer,” he said.
According to UN figures, some 1.6 million people have been displaced inside Gaza by six weeks of fighting.
A separate strike this afternoon on another building in Jabalia camp killed 32 people from the same family, 19 of them children, the official said. The ministry released a list of 32 members of the Abu Habal family it said had died.
Contacted by AFP, the Israeli army did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the two strikes.
Israel has told Palestinians to move from north Gaza for their safety, but deadly air strikes continued to hit central and southern areas of the narrow coastal territory.
This morning, hundreds of people fled on foot after the director of Gaza’s main hospital said the Israeli army ordered evacuation of the facility where some 2,000 people were trapped.
Columns of sick and injured – some of them amputees – were seen making their way out of Al-Shifa hospital towards the seafront without ambulances along with displaced people, doctors and nurses, as loud explosions were heard around the facility.

On the way, an AFP journalist saw at least 15 bodies, some in advanced stages of decomposition, along a road lined by badly damaged shops and overturned vehicles, as Israeli drones buzzed overhead.
The Hamas-run health ministry said 120 wounded, along with an unspecified number of premature babies, were still at Al-Shifa hospital that has become the focus of the recent fighting.
Israel has been pressing military operations inside the hospital, searching for the Hamas operations centre it says lies under the sprawling complex – a charge Hamas denies.
In Gaza City, Israeli troops had called over loudspeakers to evacuate Al-Shifa “in the next hour”, an AFP journalist at the hospital reported.

They also called the hospital’s director, Mohammed Abu Salmiya, telling him to ensure “the evacuation of patients, wounded, the displaced and medical staff, and that they should move on foot towards the seafront”, he said.
But Israel’s army denied ordering the evacuation, saying instead it had “acceded to the request of the director” to allow more civilians to leave.
According to Ahmed El Mokhallalati, a doctor at the hospital, “most of the medical staff and patients had left” but he was staying at Al-Shifa along with five other doctors.
Despite the evacuation order, “many patients cannot leave the hospital as they are in the ICU beds or the baby incubators,” Mokhallalati said on X, formerly Twitter.
The United Nations estimated 2,300 patients, staff and displaced Palestinians were sheltering at Al-Shifa before Israeli troops entered it on Wednesday.
Israel has imposed a siege on Gaza, allowing just a trickle of aid in from Egypt but barring most shipments of fuel over concerns Hamas could divert supplies for military purposes.
A first consignment of fuel entered Gaza after Israel’s war cabinet bowed to pressure from its ally the United States and agreed to let in two diesel tankers a day.
A two-day blackout caused by fuel shortages ended after a first delivery arrived from Egypt late yesterday, but UN officials continued to plead for a ceasefire, warning no part of Gaza is safe.
A strike on a residential building in southern Gaza killed 26 people, the director of the Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis said.

“I was asleep and we were surprised by the strike. At least 20 bombs were dropped,” Imed al-Mubasher, 45, told AFP.

His wife Sabrin Mussa said she “saw human remains everywhere” and screamed for help.
The UN said Israel had agreed to allow in 60,000 litres of fuel daily from Egypt starting Saturday, but warned it was little more than a third of what is needed to keep hospitals, water and sanitation facilities running.
Thomas White of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said Israel had “only permitted 50% of the daily fuel requirement for lifesaving humanitarian aid”.
US President Joe Biden’s chief adviser for the Middle East said more fuel deliveries and a potential “significant pause” in the fighting both depend of the release of hostages.
“The surge in humanitarian relief, the surge in fuel, the pause… will come when hostages are released,” Brett McGurk told a security conference in Bahrain.
Israel has come under scrutiny for targeting hospitals in north Gaza, but says the facilities are being used by Hamas – a claim rejected by the group and medical staff.
More than half of Gaza’s hospitals are no longer functional due to combat, damage or shortages, and people are waiting four to six hours for half the normal portion of bread.
The military says it has found rifles, ammunition, explosives and the entrance to a tunnel shaft at the Al-Shifa hospital complex, claims that cannot be independently verified.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said, without providing details, that there were “strong indications” hostages may have been held there.
Israel has not recovered hostages at the hospital but said it found not far away the bodies of two kidnapped women including a soldier.
Those held hostage range from infants to octogenarians, and there has been little information on their fate despite ongoing negotiations mediated by Qatar and Egypt to secure releases.
Waving Israeli flags and placards depicting the hostages, thousands of people approached Jerusalem today on the fifth and final day of a march calling for their release.

Iranian diplomat in Dublin denies Iran is involved in 'proxy war' in Middle East,"AN IRANIAN GOVERNMENT official based in Dublin has denied that Iran had involvement in the 7 October attacks in Israel and rejected suggestions that it is engaged in a proxy war against the West.
Dr Kazem Sharif Kazemi is Charge d’Affaire of the Iranian Embassy in Dublin and he sat down withThe Journalrecently to discuss how his government views the crisis in the Middle East.
In a wide-ranging interview, the diplomat also answered questions about the recent bloodshed in his own country where the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody after her arrest for allegedly being in breach of Iran’s strict religious dress code for women sparked a resistance movement that reached his workplace in Dublin.
The Iranian Embassy is located in Blackrock – behind an imposing high railing with an extensive CCTV surveillance system is a property that was once home to Catholic Church officials.
In May, demonstrators gathered at the premises to protest against the treatment of women in Iran. Graffiti in the form of red bloodied hands was daubed on the gate pillars. Four people were charged over the incident.
Kazemi, a historian who has a background in academia in his home country, spoke extensively about the risk of a contagion effect in the region and the possibility of a wider conflict. Although he denied that Iran was involved in a proxy war in the region, he admitted that there was support from his government for what he terms “resistance groups”.
The diplomat did not mention the resistance groups by name but Hamas is the most active in the Palestinian territory and has been declared a terrorist organisation by the EU and US Government.
Although Iran’s support for Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon is widely acknowledged in the West, US officials have confirmed Iran’s position that it did not have advance warning of the brutal 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel.
A proxy war is one in which a larger power uses smaller factions to fight with an opposing power – the larger State sponsors groups. It facilitates a deniability for those funding the activities of the smaller groups. In Iran’s case a number of studies have identified Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza as two particular groups Iran is funding.
Earlier this week,Reutersreported from Dubai that Iran’s supreme leader told the head of Hamas at a meeting in Tehran that the country will not enter the war on its behalf.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told Ismail Haniyeh at the start of November that Hamas had Iran’s political and moral support but that it would not intervene directly.
Dr Kazem Sharif Kazemi of the Iranian Embassy in Dublin.
Back in Dublin, Kazemi spoke at length about the dramatic escalation of hostilities in Palestine and said that the fighting between Israel and Hamas was a result of a failure of the international community.
As many as 1,200 Israelis were killed when Hamas fighters launched a devastating early morning raid inside Israel on 7 October. The majority of those killed were civilians. Another 241 hostages, many with dual citizenships, were taken by Hamas to Gaza.
In the aftermath of the shock attack, a bombing and ground offensive was launched by Israeli forces on Gaza which has killed more than 11,000 people, according to health ministry officials inside Gaza. The majority of those killed were civilians.
Kazemi made no condemnation of Hamas but stressed that the conflict should not just be looked at from the 7 October attacks but, he said, that the violence of Hamas was a response to the preceding 70 years of conflict in the region.
The Iranian official was careful in his language when asked byThe Journalif Iran would seek to escalate hostilities in the region.
“Actually nobody knows if this war killing machine [Israel] will continue killing people. Many analysts believe, maybe an extension of the war will happen by resistance groups.
“Nobody knows at this time because there is no action by the international community tostop Israel bombing hospitals, refugee camps and schools.
“The officials have been clear from the beginning. We say that we don’t intend to extend the war. We have many common areas with many countries, including Ireland, in demanding a ceasefire, humanitarian access, access to medicine for hospitals, as well as the releasing of hostages from both sides,” he said.

A similar message was transmitted to the US – through back channels – by Iran’s foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, according to theFinancial Timeson Friday. However, he also warned that continued Israeli action in Gaza could make escalation in the region inevitable.
“Over the past 40 days, messages have been exchanged between Iran and the US, via the US interests section at the Swiss embassy in Tehran,” he said. “We said that Iran does not want the war to spread, but due to the approach adopted by the US and Israel in the region, if the crimes against the people of Gaza and the West Bank are not stopped, any possibility could be considered, and a wider conflict could prove inevitable.”
The so-called axis of resistance is a loose coalition in the Middle East characterised by anti-Israeli, anti-Western sentiments and includes militant groups in Palestine, Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon.
Amirabdollahian also denied that these militant groups in the region were Iran’s proxy forces. However, evidence exists to the contrary. In 2019, the US think tankCentre for Strategic and International Studiespublished a study on Iran’s use of proxies to fight wars with enemies.
Now, for the first time, the group has mobilised on a number of fronts. On the day of our visit to the embassy in Blackrock, a number of Iranian Revolutionary Guards troops were killed in US airstrikes in Syria where US officials claim that Iranian troops are attacking their positions.
The same accusation has been levelled at Iranian proxies in Iraq. The Houthi rebels in Yemen are engaged in a war against the Government. They are also pitted against Saudi Arabia in a conflict in which there has been an active and complex US Special Forces involvement. Iran has been accused of financing and equipping the Houthis.
In February, anIranian General Amirali Hajizadehhad warned that his country was still seeking to kill former US president Donald Trump and his secretary of state Mike Pompeo in revenge for assassinating top commanderQasem Soleimani.
Tehran has repeatedly vowed to avenge the killing of Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ foreign operations, in a US drone strike on Baghdad airport in January 2020.
Soleimani was claimed at the time to have led operations targeting US military and civilians with some of the attacks perpetrated by proxy elements.
The Iranians have also supplied weaponry -  including drone technology – to Russia which has been used in Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
Extensive sanctions have been imposed by western powers on Iran in response to concerns over their nuclear weapons programs.
Another article from theInternational Institute of Strategic Studiesalso cites extensive evidence of Iran’s use of proxies such as Hamas and Hezbollah.
When we asked Kazemi if Iran was engaged in a proxy war in the region he immediately denied, unprompted, Iranian involvement in the 7 October attacks by Hamas.
“Since the beginning of the 7 October, unfortunately many times America and a few countries, try to play with words,” he said.

In the wake of the Hamas attacks,US officials said that therewas no evidence to support an accusation of Iranian involvement.
“Iranian policy is clear in its support of resistance groups in oppressed countries based on international law and justice. Any country occupied needs resistance groups to be free, including in Ireland in the last centuries,” Kazemi said.
Those “resistance groups” he is referencing are Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as other groups such as the Houthis in Yemen.
“The problem is that everybody is trying to somehow say that there is a proxy war anddrag Iran in [to the conflict] in some way, but Iran wasn’t involved in the 7 October.
“Resistance groups makes their own decision,” he added.

On Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been engaged in a number of deadly skirmishes with Israeli Defence Forces soldiers and aircraft. Sources, with a direct knowledge of events in the area, have said that Hezbollah is particularly targeting Israel’s observation positions and military infrastructure.
Most recent reports from AFP said that at least 87 people have been killed in Lebanon since hostilities began: more than 60 Hezbollah fighters, 12 other combatants including from Palestinian groups, and 11 civilians.
Cross-border violence since 7 October has killed nine people in northern Israel including six soldiers, according to official figures.
Another seven Hezbollah fighters have been killed in Syria in strikes attributed to Israel.
Kazemi repeatedly justified the actions of what he termed resistance groups and also referenced Ireland’s revolutionary past in those justifications.
“The other resistance groups will make their own decision – it is not an Iranian decision.Resistance groups have the right and the capability to act, when and how take reactiondepending on themselves.
“Freedom from occupation and colonial power is not possible without resistance, [this is] a lesson from Irish history,” he added.
On the likelihood of a military response directly from Iran in regard to the bombing of Gaza, the Iranian official spoke at length and criticised the international community’s failure to protect the Palestinian population. He also claimed that the wars in the Middle East were caused by the arms industry and its need for conflict to sell arms.

The Journalalso asked Kazemi about the protests and the subsequent crack down by the Iranian government on protestors following the death of Mahsa Amini.
The death of 22-year-old Amini, after her arrest for allegedly breaching Iran’s strict dress code for women, had fuelled the biggest protests seen in the Islamic Republic for years.
Young women led the charge, removing their headscarves, chanting anti-government slogans and confronting the security forces on the streets, despite a crackdown that rights groups say has killed hundreds.
Executions of protestors followed, fora variety of offencesincluding religious offences such as “enmity of god”. The government claimed that other protesters killed police officers during demonstrations but there is no independent journalism emerging from Iran so it is difficult to verify such claims.
AnAmnesty International reportsaid that its investigations had found that between 15,000 and 16,000 people were arbitrarily detained during the government crackdown.
It also said that torture and ill-treatment of detained people was widespread and there was an increase in executions and a resumption of public hangings.
We asked Kazemi about his views on the treatment of women in Iran and how they match up to his experience of women’s freedoms in Ireland. We also spoke to him about human rights abuses.
He claimed – in direct contradiction to the Amnesty report – that since the Islamic revolution in 1979 that Iran had improved on human rights.
“We are not stopping at this position, we should continue our progress – human rights, women’s rights… Iran has a very active and dynamic society. Iran is proud of its young generation,” he said.
He claimed that much of the protest movement was led by “influencer countries” such as the United States. An extensive trawl byThe Journalof online resources and discussions with sources familiar with the movement has not been able to confirm this assertion.
He referenced the Irish government’s introduction of new sentencing regimes for people who assault gardaí in his justification for the Iranian government response.
“In Iran after Mahsa Amini died, by provocation of outside [against from other countries] who tried to make instability inside of Iran and because of that 50 police[men] were killed…” he said.
He claimed that there was misinformation from “western countries” that the protests were peaceful.
At the time, theIrish Department of Foreign Affairsstrongly criticised Iran in a speech at the United Nations and supported reports that the right to freedom of expression and right to assembly had been reduced in Iran.
“We are deeply concerned that women, journalists, human rights defenders, teachers and members of minority communities have been particularly targeted,” the DFA said in a statement.
“People in Iran have the right to peaceful protest. That right must be ensured in all circumstances.”
The European Union’s chief diplomat,Josep Borrellsaid at the time: “The internal situation in Iran continues to be a source of great concern. The current uprisings reveal deep frustration. The key demands of the current protests are respect for fundamental human rights, dignity, and real change.”
Kazemi stressed the importance of connections with Ireland and said that it is viewed by his Government as a key member of the European Union.
The diplomat said that his role in Dublin was to “completely open the bilateral” relationship between Ireland and Iran.
Those connections almost certainly played a role in the recentrelease of Irish citizenBernard Phelan who was held in Iran for seven months before his release in May.
It appears that hope is reciprocated by the Irish side with an honorary consulate in Tehran. There was also a recent visit to Iran by a senior Department of Foreign Affairs official and a 2022 visit by then Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.

"'People Before Profit are not eurosceptic, we’re euro-critical’: Gino Kenny on party's EU stance","WELCOME TO POLICY Matters, a series from The Journal that takes a deep dive into the ideas and solutions proposed by Ireland’s politicians on some of the biggest issues of the day.
As part of the series, The Journal sits down with different spokespeople from across Ireland’s political parties to take a deeper look at what they believe needs to be done across areas like housing, health, the environment and childcare.
Last time around, we spoke to Fine Gael’s John Cummins who told us that there is “no question” that homelessness remains thebiggest challenge in housing.
This week, we sat down with People Before Profit’s foreign affairs spokesperson Gino Kenny to discuss his party’s stance on Ireland’s record on the international stage and his view of the biggest foreign policy issues facing the country.
———
PEOPLE BEFORE PROFIT’S Foreign Affairs spokesperson takes umbrage to the idea that his party is a eurosceptic one.
“I’m not sure I would use that term,” Kenny said.
In his view it is a term that has been captured by the far-right.
“We’ve been very euro-critical on a number of issues,” he said.
Indeed, the party, which has representatives in Northern Ireland, supported Britain leaving the EU and campaigned for a ‘Lexit’ (left-wing Brexit) in the run up to the 2016 referendum.
On the People Before Profit website you’ll find references to the “imperial agenda” of EU leaders and Brussels’ desire to “push neoliberalism”.
But Kenny said while he isn’t anti-EU, he is against the direction the EU is heading in.
“Most people in Ireland would be supportive of the European Union, that’s fact. And if there was a referendum to leave the European Union it would fail,” Kenny said.
“I would say I’m pro-European, you know, but I’m not pro-European in terms of the European Union and the direction of the European Union.”
Kenny said this comes down to his view that the EU is a “corporate entity” rather than one focused on social advancement.
He suspects that anti-EU sentiment is growing somewhat in Ireland but that this can be categorised in different ways, with people who are perhaps anti-EU for immigration reasons on one side, and people who are anti-EU for reasons relating to its capitalist nature on another.
“The European Union is pro-market, it’s pro-capitalist. People Before Profit would like to see less of all those things and more of a socialist project where European states are run on the basis of need, rather than a capitalist and consumerist model,” Kenny said.
Does this mean People Before Profit would like to see Ireland leave the EU?
“I don’t think that’s where we are at,” Kenny said.
“I don’t think the public would be on the side of Ireland leaving the European Union.”
For now, People Before Profit wants to engage in the European system.
Despite having no previous electoral success at European level, the party plans to run a candidate in the Dublin constituency next May and possibly a second candidate outside of Dublin too.
But Kenny is tight-lipped on who these candidates will be, saying “nothing has been finalised yet”.

When it comes to foreign affairs, the ongoing situation in Israel and Gaza is unsurprisingly top of Kenny’s lists of concerns.
Next week, he and party colleague Bríd Smith TD were to travel to Egypt as part of a convoy to the Rafah crossing where they hoped to attempt to press the Egyptian authorities to allow more aid to pass through to Gaza. That trip has now been postponed.
People Before Profit supported both the Sinn Féin and Social Democrats’ motions last week to refer Israel to the International Criminal Court and expel the Israeli ambassador to Ireland.
Kenny said he was disappointed but not surprised that the motions did not pass but noted the strong public support for both motions.
“I’ve never seen the amount of emails that came into the Oireachtas, it was incredible. The only kind of parallel that I’ve seen in my time here was the situation with the Mother and Baby Homes and that was a fraction of [the emails we got],” he said.
People Before Profit has been at the forefront of demonstrations held in support of Palestine, with this weekend being the sixth weekend in a row where thousands plan to take to the streets of Dublin.
Kenny said to his mind it is comparable to the anti-war sentiment that existed in 2003 around the Iraq war. He noted that these pro-Palestine marches have drawn engagement from people who wouldn’t normally go to protests but who feel particularly angry about the situation.
“Going out and protesting and marching, it’s not going to stop the war, but [people] feel like they’re doing something and that’s the dynamic that’s at play at the moment,” he said.
On where the situation goes next, Kenny said a ceasefire has to be the next step but beyond that he has lost faith that a two-state solution is achievable.
“Most Palestinians would accept that a two-state solution is just not possible.
“There needs to be a one-state solution where people just can live together. Now, that seems very simplified. But I think that is the only solution where people can live together,” Kenny said.
The Dublin Mid-West TD said while there was no justification for Hamas’ brutal killing of approximately 1,200 Israeli people on 7 October, the attack needs to be viewed in the context of the history of Palestine.
“You have to give it context because otherwise the whole picture is distorted,” he said.
“Palestinians, particularly people in Gaza, have been living under blockade for the last 16 years. It’s an open prison. And when you do that to a cohort of people, people will do things that me and you will never agree with.
“I’m not justifying the seventh of October, but when you brutalise people so, so much, people will do things that I don’t agree with or no rational person would agree with,” Kenny said.
Speaking about Ireland’s performance in the global arena in general terms, it’s Kenny’s view that the country “punches above its weight” when it comes to things like international aid.
He said Ireland is seen internationally as neutral and an honest broker.
“Our history can be shared with a lot of countries in the world in relation to our post-colonial past.
“We have huge empathy in relation to those that have been oppressed and those that have fled from famine and those that are fleeing from poverty,” Kenny said.
“We have a unique position, because of our history. And I think our future is that, as a people we try to help address injustice, not only in Ireland, but internationally,” he added.
Bringing the conversation back to Palestine, Kenny said this is why Ireland should do more to be a leader on pushing for a ceasefire and peace.
He referred to comments made by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in the Dáil this week when he said that Ireland would lose influence bygoing too far out on a limb in relation to sanctions on Israel.
“This is the moment to be out on a limb,” Kenny said.
He pointed to Ireland being one of the first countries in the world in 1987 to introduce legislation to ban goods from apartheid South Africa.
“Ireland was a leader in relation to that. So we can be a leader again,” Kenny said.

Chaos and confusion at UCD debate on Israel and Palestine,"THERE WERE CHAOTIC scenes at the end of a University College Dublin Debate last night on the conflict in Palestine.
The debate was hosted by the university’s Literary & Historical Society and the motion debated was: “This House believes that the West has failed Palestine.”
Videos on social media show people shouting “get out” and appear to show people being escorted out of the Fitzgerald Chamber where the debate was being held.
A man is also heard repeatedly shouting Allahu Akbar, which prompts many attendees to leave as security intervenes.

People Before Profit’s Richard Boyd Barrett debated Natasha Hausdorff of UK Lawyers for Israel.
Speaking toThe Journal, Richard Boyd Barrett described the debate as “a bit chaotic” and added that it ended in “verbal argy-bargy”.
Delays
The debate was delayed in starting by at least an hour after issues with the line-up among the speakers.
The debate was originally due to have at least two speakers on each side, but one speaker on the pro-Palestinian side withdrew on the day before the debate.
It is understood that the remaining speakers were told about this after 6pm last night, shortly before the debate was due to start. Speakers were also informed that two pro-Palestinian speakers had been added instead.
“We had not been informed of this change in advance, and I had no idea who these people were,” Natasha Hausdorff said in an email toThe Journal.
Hausdorff noted that she had originally agreed to attend and participate in the debate based on the original line-up of speakers. After being told about the new additions to the line-up, she was “not prepared to accept the last-minute changes and share a platform with these speakers”.
Ibrahim Halawa was one of those due to debate alongside Boyd Barrett, while pro-Israel commentator Mark Humphrys was due to debate on the opposing side.
Halawa, from Firhouse in Dublin, was arrested during a protest in 2013 in support of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi who had been elected by Egypt’s people before being ousted from power in a military coup.
He spent more than four years in various Cairo jails before being exonerated by an Egyptian court.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mark Humphrys said he was “willing to debate” with Halawa but that Natasha Hausdorff was not.

He said he “had to respect” this decision and described it as a “frustrating evening”.
The debate
The L&H society initially proposed using students to fill in for some of the speakers, rather than the invited guests, before instead suggesting a one-on-one debate between Boyd Barrett and Hausdorff.
“We were three invited guests, we were sitting there for an hour waiting for the thing to start and we were increasingly thinking ‘why is this not starting?’”, Boyd Barrett said.
“They then asked would Ibrahim and the other guest step back and allow for just a one-to-one debate.”
Boyd Barrett added that the UCD society appeared to indicate that “there may have been some sort of communications error”.
“It was all very odd and by the time it actually got going, you were seriously wondering whether the whole thing should be cancelled.”
There was also a larger than usual security presence at the debate, which Boyd Barrett said “seemed a bit over the top”.
“I didn’t really understand why there was any need for that to be honest,” he added.
However, the People Before Profit TD said he “wouldn’t go overboard on what happened”.
He toldThe Journal: “I think student debates can get a bit rowdy and I wouldn’t describe it as much more than verbal argy-bargy at the very end debate, and quite a bit of confusion and delay in terms of the debate starting.”
The Literary & Historical Society said: “The function of the L&H is to promote open discourse in UCD. This means that we sometimes have to have difficult, but necessary, conversations.
“How we advertise events depends on the event, the venue and the timeline of confirming speakers.”
The society said the event had been “controlled at all times” but the post-debate Q&A finished early “due to active crowd interjections at the end” because it was difficult for speakers to be heard.
“We understand that ‘chaos’ sounds better in a headline, but in reality there were simply some crowd interjections towards the end,” L&H said.
The individuals were asked to leave, and left “in an orderly manner” the society said.
It added that the group of individuals also enjoyed a post-debate reception immediately outside the event.
UCD has been approached for comment byThe Journal.

Family of Irish-Israeli girl believed to be captured by Hamas remain positive on her birthday,"THE FAMILY OF an Irish-Israeli girl believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza said they are remaining positive that they will see her again.
A birthday gathering was held at St Stephen’s Green in Dublin for Emily Hand, who turned nine today.
A birthday cake and balloons bearing Emily’s name were unveiled, as well as a poster saying “Bring her home now”.
Emily Hand turned nine todayDavid Young / PADavid Young / PA / PA
Emily Hand was initially thought to be dead in the aftermath of the attack on Israeli citizens on 7 October, but more recent information indicates that she is now feared kidnapped in Gaza.
Emily’s father, Tom, has met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Hand family have appealed for the government’s help in securing her release.
Anna Byrne, a cousin of Emily’s father, attended the birthday gathering.
She said it had been a horrific time for the family, but they are staying strong and positive.

She said: “We are so thankful to the organisers of today, the whole family is so thankful for keeping Emily in everybody’s hearts and minds.
“Especially today. It is quite sad today because we were hoping to have her home for her birthday. We don’t know what type of birthday she is having.
“I just thought I would come today to represent the family and to be here for Emily and to wish her a happy birthday.”
She added: “We are trying to keep strong and positive. We worry about Tom, he is doing so much and it is hard for him to keep going.
“It is a horrific time so we just try to give as much support as we can and send our love and best wishes, but it is hard.
“You feel useless, not being able to do anything and they are so far away. None of us can go to Israel so it is very hard but we are keeping positive and just praying and hoping.
“The family are so positive, that is the thing that is keeping us all going, the positivity that we are going to see Emily.”
Tánaiste Micheál Martin visited two towns in southern Israel yesterdaythat had been attacked by Hamas in October.
They included Kibbutz Be’eri where Emily was believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas.

Tánaiste says he was 'shocked' by negative reactions to his visit to Israel,"TÁNAISTE MICHEÁL MARTIN has said he was “shocked” by negative reactions expressed about his visit to Israel yesterday.
The Tánaiste was on anofficial trip to Israel yesterdaywhere he visited sites attacked by Hamas on 7 October, including the town of Sderot where 45 people were killed and Kibbutz Be’eri, a farming community where around 130 people were killed.
Government sources had said one reason behind the trip, which was scheduled only a few days in advance, was to push for Irish citizens to be allowed to flee from Gaza, where Israel has launched an unrelenting retaliation claiming the lives of more than 11,000 people. Israel has put the death toll from the Hamas attacks on 7 October at 1,200 people.
The Tánaiste was photographed visiting sites of damage in Israel, attracting criticism from some politicians and activists who questioned why he was meeting with Israeli politicians and not showcasing the damage inflicted upon Gaza.
“I was a bit shocked about it, actually, and I think it’s a reminder that we need to create contexts for genuine debate and discussion,” Martin said.

Speaking to reporters this morning, the Tánaiste said: “Some of the simplistic vitriol that I looked at myself yesterday evening, I just couldn’t believe.”

“It’s very important in situations like this that we seek to understand where people are coming from, because if you don’t, if you don’t understand that, then you have very little chance of making a meaningful or informed contribution to resolving issues, and that’s our objective: to contribute to the resolution of issues,” he said.
“We had a really good discussion yesterday with the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and you wouldn’t have read about that online, because people wanted to create a particular narrative.”

Martin, who is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, confirmed that the number of Irish citizens trapped in Gaza was a key reason for the trip.
“We felt last week, because no Irish citizen had come out, that there was a need to come out to meet people in person,” he said.
“It was good news then that that final push, I think, yielded the outcome that we have 26 out now.
“We won’t be satisfied until everybody is out, every Irish citizen and their dependents. The diplomatic network is very important in situations like this,” he said.

Lack of fuel shuts down all internet and phone networks across Gaza,"A LACK OF fuel in the Gaza Strip shut down all internet and phone networks yesterday, the main Palestinian telecom provider said, effectively cutting off the besieged territory from the outside world.
In a signal that Israel’s ground invasion could soon expand to the south, Palestinians in parts of southern Gaza said they received evacuation notices yesterday.
Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are crowded into the south, including hundreds of thousands who heeded Israel’s calls to evacuate the north to get out of the way of its offensive.
Nearly every single person in the Gaza Strip does not have enough food, and more than two out of every three people do not have clean drinking water, the United Nations said yesterday.
Residents say bread is scarce and supermarket shelves are bare. Central electricity and running water have been out for weeks.
At least 11,470 Palestinians – two-thirds of them women and minors – have been killed since the war began, according to Palestinian health authorities, which do not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. About 2,700 people are reported missing.
The general manager of Palestine telecommunications company, Paltel, said he has urged international bodies to persuade Israel to allow fuel to enter Gaza in order to restore phone and internet to the besieged enclave.
“We asked all international bodies to intervene with Israel in order to allow the entry of fuel,” Abdulmajeed Melhem told The Associated Press.
Earlier on Thursday, Paltel announced all communication services – landlines, mobile phones and internet connections – were down due to a lack of fuel.

“Since the outbreak of the war, there has been no electricity, therefore we have relied on alternative sources to operate the generators,” Melhem said.
“If they (Israel) allow the entry of fuel, this problem will be solved.”
Gaza’s fragile communication network has broken down several times during the conflict because of bombardment or shutdowns by Israel, but each time Gaza authorities were able to quickly get it back working.
Previous blackouts have traumatised Palestinians, leaving them unable to call ambulances or reach dispersed family members to ensure they are alive amid the bombardment.
Aid workers say it hampers humanitarian operations and hospitals.
The blackout also largely cuts Gaza off from the outside world, making it even harder for international media to cover events on the ground.
Israel vowed to wipe out Hamas after the militant group launched its 7 October incursion.
Some 1,200 people have died in Israel, mostly during the initial attack, and around 240 people were taken captive by militants.
Israel responded with a weeks-long air campaign and a ground invasion of northern Gaza.
Meanwhile, The White House said it believes Israel can dramatically reduce the threat from Hamas, but that eliminating the group and its ideology is likely impossible.
National security council spokesperson John Kirby pointed to the US efforts to disrupt al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, a day after US President Joe Biden said Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza would only end once the militant group was no longer a threat.","6.51am, 17 Nov 2023",,
Israeli troops seize control of Gaza port as UN warns of risk of starvation,"LAST UPDATE|16 Nov 2023
ISRAELI TROOPS HAVE advanced their campaign to destroy Hamas in Gaza, fighting gun battles and taking control of a key port a day after a raid on the territory’s main hospital.
The ground campaign has taken aim at key sites like Gaza government buildings and infrastructure, but also the Al-Shifa hospital that Israel says sits atop a Hamas command centre – a charge the group denies.
Bombardment thundered and gunfire rattled in besieged Gaza, AFP live video showed.
The Israeli army said today its troops had taken “operational control” of the port at Gaza City in the territory’s north, showing at least a dozen tanks and groups of soldiers massed on the coast near Gaza City.
Israel has concentrated its heavy bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza City, announcing this week the seizure of the parliament building, government offices and Hamas police headquarters.
The Red Crescent said Israeli tanks were laying siege to Gaza’s Al-Ahli hospital in a “violent attack” today, as Israel accuses Hamas of using health facilities as bases.
“Teams are unable to move and reach those who are injured,” the organisation said on X, formerly Twitter.
Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, warned of a deliberate attempt to paralyse its operations.
“I do believe there is a deliberate attempt to strangle our operation and paralyse the UNRWA operation,” he told a press conference in Geneva.
Lazzarini also said that Gaza is “again in a total communication blackout, and… it is because there is no fuel”.
The Palestinian telecom company Paltel confirmed the blackout, saying on X, formerly Twitter: “We regret to announce that all telecom services in Gaza Strip have gone out of service as all energy sources sustaining the network have been depleted, and fuel was not allowed in.”

Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas in retaliation for the attacks of 7 October, which killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and saw about 240 people hostage, according to Israeli officials.
The Israeli military says 51 of its troops have been killed in Gaza since fighting began.
But with the health ministry saying the death toll from the offensive has now topped 11,500, including thousands of children, calls for a truce are mounting.

The military said last night that it launched an additional operation at Al-Shifa, hours after a pre-dawn raid that Israeli forces said uncovered rifles, ammunition and explosives from the compound.
Both Israel and its top ally the US say Hamas has built tunnels below the Al-Shifa complex.
The Palestinian militant group and directors at the hospital have denied the charge, and Hamas also rejected reports of weapons being at the site.
The UN’s World Food Programme said today that civilians in Gaza face starvation because food and water had become “practically non-existent”.
“With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,” the executive director of the Rome-based WFP, Cindy McCain, said in a statement.
The agency, which has been warning of increasing hunger for weeks in Gaza, said that bread was now “scarce or non-existent” and that it was impossible to “meet current hunger needs with one operational border crossing”.
It said the only hope would be to open a second safe passage to bring food into Gaza.
Israel’s army claimed an initial raid in Al-Shifa had uncovered military equipment, weapons and what spokesman Daniel Hagari described as “an operational headquarters with comms equipment”.
A video narrated by another Israeli army spokesman showed rifles, ammunition and ammo magazines inside an area he identified as Al-Shifa’s MRI scanner building.
The health ministry in Gaza argued yesterday the Israeli military did not find any weapons when it raided the hospital.

Polls in Israel show widespread public support for military action against Hamas following the 7 October attacks.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday boasted there was no safe place for Hamas and “no place in Gaza” the army would not reach.
“They told us we wouldn’t reach the outskirts of Gaza City and we did, they told us we wouldn’t enter Al-Shifa and we did,” he said.
But Netanyahu, who has led Israel on-and-off for 16 years, is under intense domestic pressure to account for political and security failings surrounding the attack.
Protesters have taken to the streets demanding greater efforts to free the hostages.
Qatar, which hosts a Hamas political office and also has communication channels with Israel, has meanwhile led negotiations for the release of the hostages.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Biden said he was “mildly hopeful” there would be a deal.

The death and suffering in the densely populated coastal territory has prompted growing concern for Gaza’s civilians, who have fled south to try to escape the heaviest fighting.
A group of Irish citizens yesterdaymade the journey out of Gaza and into Egyptvia the Rafah crossing.
The group of 23 individuals included Irish citizens and their relatives. Their processing at the border took several hours.
It was the first time that Irish citizens who have been stuck in Gaza since conflict broke out in the region have been able to leave.
Several more Irish citizens departed Gaza today.
A spokesperson in the Department of Foreign Affairs toldThe Journalthis morning that it “welcomes the inclusion of more Irish citizens on the list for departure from Gaza today”.
“We have continued to stay in contact with our citizens in Gaza overnight and throughout this morning. The consular team from our Embassy in Cairo are again at Rafah to provide support and transport onwards from the border,” they added.

“It impacts on all foreign nationals coming out of Gaza.”

Activists protest at Department of Foreign Affairs offices in call for ceasefire,"PRO-PALESTINE ACTIVISTS entered the Department of Foreign Affairs building today to call on the government to demand that the UN seeks a binding ceasefire in Gaza.
The ‘Dublin for Gaza’ group called on Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin to bring aUniting for Peace resolutionto the UN General Assembly to push for a ceasefire.
The protesters also want to see the Irish government prevent the transport of weapons through Shannon Airport.
In a statement toThe Journal, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs said it “can confirm that a protest took place outside the Department’s offices this afternoon, during which a small number of protestors entered the public reception area”.
Spokesperson for Dublin for Gaza Rosie Leonard said: “US President Joe Biden is pledging military aid and weapons to the Israeli state – we call on the Minister to ensure that Ireland plays no part in transporting these weapons of destruction to Israel.”

“Across the world, we are seeing workers block military aid to Israel by refusing to handle weapons, refusing to unload weapons bound for Israel, and blocking warships headed to the Middle East. Now we must play our part,” Leonard said.
Fellow member Freda Hughes said that “kind words are all very well but now it’s time our government takes action”.
“There are over 40 Irish citizens trapped in Gaza, some of whom are in contact with us regularly,” Hughes said.
“They are deeply traumatised and that trauma is compounded daily. Unlike last week’s non-binding UN General Assembly vote for a humanitarian truce, which Israel chose to ignore, a United for Peace resolution is legally binding. The Department has already received hundreds of calls and emails requesting this and we ask the Minister to do so immediately.”
Yesterday, the governmentquashed a motion in the Dáilseeking to expel the Israeli ambassador and impose economic sanctions on Israel.
The Social Democrats had brought a motion to the Dáil this evening calling for the Government to bring economic sanctions against Israel, refer it to the International Criminal Court for investigation of alleged war crimes, and to withdraw the Israeli ambassador’s diplomatic status in Ireland.
However, Government TDs voted to replace the Social Democrats’ motion with one reasserting that the government will maintain diplomatic relations with the Israeli ambassador and “pursue all possible avenues at the EU and the UN to build an international alliance for peace”.

Heated Dáil exchanges as government accused of ‘double standards’ on Israel and Russia,"
The Journal/ YouTube
THERE WERE HEATED exchanges in the Dáil today as Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty hit out at the government for not supporting his party’s motion for Ireland to refer Israel to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
During questions on promised legislation, Doherty accused Mr McGrath of “double standards”, questioning why Ireland referred Russia to the ICC over Ukraine, but not Israel over its recent actions.
“So last year, this government rightly joined with others in referring Russia to the International Criminal Court for war crimes,” he said.
“Palestinian lives, minister, are just as worthy of our attention as Ukrainian lives.
“In the pursuit of justice and accountability for the Palestinian people, will this government now change direction and join with South Africa and refer Israel to the ICC for the crimes, that you say are difficult to watch in the news, but war crimes we see before our eyes every single day.”
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed today that South Africa filed a referral to the ICC for an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by Israel in Gaza
The move comes as South African lawmakers are to debate a motion calling for the closure of the Israeli Embassy in South Africa and the cutting of all diplomatic ties with the country until it agrees to a cease-fire.
McGrath insisted the situation in Ukraine was “fundamentally different”, explaining to Doherty that the ICC prosecutor has publicly stated that Israel was already under investigation.
The office of the prosecutor of the ICC said last week its mandate applies to the current conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The prosecutor’s office has said the ICC has had an ongoing investigation into “the situation in the State of Palestine” for alleged war crimes committed since 13 June 2014.

“This mandate is ongoing and applies to crimes committed in the current context,” the prosecutors said.
McGrath said Ireland did refer Russia to the ICC prosecutor because in that case Ukraine was not a party to the ICC statute. “A prosecutor could not therefore begin an immediate investigation without a state party referral,” he explained.
He reiterated that the chief prosecutor for the ICC had already confirmed that an ongoing investigation in the Middle East covered the events of recent weeks in Israel and Gaza.
McGrath said he was stating the “facts” to Doherty, though the minister said the Sinn Féin deputy might not like them.
Pearse Doherty on his feet in the Dáil today accusing the government of double standards.
The government also faced claims of double standards on Israel and Russia after it voted down calls for sanctions against the Israeli state over its actions in Gaza.
Opposition motions calling for a range of economic and diplomatic sanctions, including the expulsion of Israel’s ambassador in Dublin Dana Erlich, were defeated in the Dail on yesterday evening.
Proposals for Ireland to refer Israel to the International Criminal Court (ICC) were also voted down.
Earlier, during Leaders’ Questions, People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett also drew a comparison with the government’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
“Setting aside the ambassador, why sanctions on Putin for his war crimes, but nothing, no sanction whatsoever ever, ever imposed on Israel, even when they’re slaughtering thousands and thousands of children?” he asked.
“Last night, 55 deputies in here voted to expel the Israeli ambassador, to sanction Israel, to refer them for war crimes and for genocide, but still you voted against.
“Now could you please explain to me what level of atrocity Israel has to commit, how many babies they have to murder, how many hospitals they have to bomb, how many houses they have to bomb, how many people they have to ethnically cleanse before you think it would be time to impose the sorts of sanctions that you were very quick to impose on Russia, for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.
“Are Palestinian babies and lives less valuable than those of Ukrainians that you don’t feel it is justified in the face of the slaughter to sanction them for the crimes they are committing?” asked Boyd Barrett.
“Why do you continue to peddle the notion that Israel is interested in peace?” Boyd Barrett asked the minister.

McGrath said it was difficult to watch the news lately, given the horrifying scenes coming out of Gaza, but he reiterated the government’s view that maintaining diplomatic relations with Israel was important.
Keeping diplomatic channels open is vital given ongoing efforts to secure safe passage through the Rafah crossing into Egypt for Irish citizens who remained in Gaza, he told the Dáil.
He also spoke of the attempts to secure the release of Irish-Israeli girl Emily Hand, who is believed to be being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.
“International diplomacy and maintaining channels of communication is not about staying close to your friends or about endorsing policies, it’s about keeping channels open for when you need them,” McGrath said.
“And we need them because in trying to secure the safe access out of Gaza of the remaining of our citizens there, and in trying to be heard in advocating for peace, it’s important that we continue to communicate and we continue to have dialogue with all of those in the region.
McGrath also highlighted that there are over close to 400 UN Irish peacekeepers in the region.
McGrath said the only way to achieve peace is through dialogue.
“We know our history, and Ireland is a respected voice on this issue because of our own historical experience on this island. So we are continuing to work through all of those channels,” he said.
“So Ireland has to maintain diplomatic relations with Israel. But we also will call out when we see it, the level of force that has been used in our view is completely disproportionate.
“Civilians should be protected. Gaza and Hamas are not the same thing, the civilians in Gaza should not be the subject of collective punishment by the Israeli Defence Force.
“So Ireland is an important actor. We have a voice, we are being listened to.”

The group of people allowed to leave were advised to be at the crossing before 7am local time today (5am Irish time).
A message noted: “You should consider making your way to the Crossing in the morning, noting that the authorities advise that you must be in attendance at the External Hall by 7am local time to facilitate your crossing.
“If you do not avail of the opportunity to cross when you name appears on a list, there is no guarantee that you will be permitted to exit on a future date.

Micheál Martin visits home damaged in 7 October Hamas attack during trip to Israel,"LAST UPDATE|16 Nov 2023
TÁNAISTE AND FOREIGN Affairs Minister Micháel Martin is on an official trip to Israel today, where he is visiting towns attacked by Hamas militants on 7 October.
The attacks began just before dawn on 7 October as hundreds of Hamas gunmen poured across the border into Israel.
Hundreds of rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip as the attackers raced across fields within Israel.
From just before 7am the attackers started forcing their way into several farming communities and also stormed a festival where hundreds of young people had been dancing all night.
Israel says 25 farming communities and towns near the Gaza border were methodically attacked, among them Sderot, Ofakim and Netivot.
Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas in retaliation for the attacks, which killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
Micheál Martin was in Egypt yesterday to meet with officials before travelling to Israel today. He will also visit Palestine and is expected to meet with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
Government sources have said one reason behind the trip, which was scheduled just this week, is to push for Irish citizens to be allowed to leave the region.

Martin this morning met with Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen in Sderot.
Ayelet Shmuel, the director of the international resilience centre in Sderot, gave Martin a briefing on what happened in the Israeli town on 7 October when Hamas militants attacked.
“We have awful images of them killing a woman that was right here in her car – she was driving with two little daughters.”

“This was a battlefield with a tank in the middle,” says Shmuel who says there were 25 Hamas militants in the police station on 7 October, with over 70 in the city overall.
45 people were killed in Sderot during the attack including several Holocaust survivors who were on a bus tour that had stopped to repair a flat tyre, says Shmuel.
After the 7 October, Sderot was evacuated but around 8,000 residents have now returned from hotels elsewhere in Israel. Schools have still not reopened due to concerns over rocket attacks and the short time children would have to get to bomb shelters.
“Over 250 families lost their homes, or the homes are not liveable right now,” says Shmuel. “So even if the residents come back, they have nowhere to go to.”

The Tánaiste was also shown a house in Sderot damaged by a Hamas rocket on 7 October.
He was later given a tour of Kibbutz Be’eri where almost 10% of the community were killed on 7 October.
Before the attack, Dublin-born Tom Hand and his eight-year-old daughter Emily lived in this kibbutz. Hand’s former wife and the mother of his two older children was killed during the attack while Emily is now believed to have been taken hostage in Gaza.
At Kibbutz Be’eri, Martin spoke with Moshe Malaya from Zaka, a network of Jewish faith-based rescue units who helped to collect and identify the bodies of victims of the Hamas attack.

Martin also this morning met with Alon Davidi, the mayor of Sderot, at the town hall. Cohen and Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Elrich also attended the meeting.
At the start of his remarks, Davidi asked “are these people here to support us?”.
Davidi described how his family experiences regular rocket attacks from Hamas in nearby Gaza, saying they had to seek cover in bomb shelters often.
“I have seven kids aged 12 to 25. Most of my children [do] not understand how to behave like normal children,” he said.
He said Hamas destroyed their lives, outlives and the future of this area.

“I’m begging you to support Israel,” he told Martin.
The Tánaiste responded: “I’m here to see this firsthand and to listen; to seek to understand the trauma that your community has gone through and not just in horrific events over the seventh but as you said for over two decades, if not three decades, in terms of rockets.
“Ireland is unequivocal in its condemnation of the Hamas attack and will give no quarter to that form of terrorism. We are explicit in our public statements in condemning without condition the unconscionable attacks on children, on women and on innocent civilians. I don’t say that here to please anybody – that’s where I come from.”
Martin said that Ireland’s support for a two state solution should not be equated with support for Hamas and “absolutely” affirmed Israel’s right to exist – “in case that is in question”.
He noted that Irish-Israeli citizen Kim Damti had been murdered by Hamas and Emily Hand taken hostage in Gaza.
But Martin said he did not believe that a military solution would create an environment for future generations: “We may have to disagree on that – and I respect where you’re coming from – but our senses that there’s a real danger that you will radicalise opinion of future generations even more.”
While speaking to press in Jerusalem after visiting communities in southern Israel, Martin thanked Cohen for assisting Irish citizens to be evacuated from Gaza.
The Tánaiste said Cohen gave him “assurances that the majority of those citizens will be able to leave Gaza within the next three days”.
“We know that there are some coming up today – although there has been a delay in respect to the processing side,” he said.
In Gaza, Israeli troopsremain in the region’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, targeting what it said was a Hamas command centre nestled among patients, medics and the displaced.
The Gaza health ministry has claimed the death toll from the Israeli offensive on the region has now topped 11,500, including thousands of children.
Protesters have this afternoon occupied the Department of Foreign Affairs on St Stephen’s Green in Dublin calling on Martin to use his powers to call for a binding ceasefire in Gaza via the United Nations and to immediately halt all transportation of weapons through Shannon Airport.

From living in 'darkness and fear' to safety: Irish family on their relief in leaving Gaza,"AN IRISH FAMILY who were among a group of over 20 Irish citizens that have been allowed to leave Gaza said they have enjoyed their “first night in 50 days without fear”.
Ibrahim Alagha, his wife, and three children were among the group of 23 Irish citizens and their relatives who have made the journey out of Gaza and into Egypt via the Rafah border crossing.
The Rafah border crossing opened on 1 November to allow foreigners and dual nationals to flee the besieged region.
It was the first time Egypt has opened the Rafah crossing since the Israel-Hamas conflict began on 7 October.
Yesterday was the first time that Irish citizens in Gaza have been included in a list of those able to leave the region.
Speaking toThe Journal, Ibrahim Alagha said that he and his family were informed at around 10pm on the day before their journey that they would be included in a list of evacuees.
Alagha and his family were inGaza visting family when the fighting broke out.
“So we got the news and we were not able to sleep that night from happiness and from the good news,” said Alagha.
“I knew that not all Irish citizens had made it out on that day, so we were very delighted we were on that list.”
He and his family arrived at the Rafah border crossing at around 7am, following an eight-hour car journey.
“Even the road trip was very lengthy,” said Alagha.
“Usually it takes five hours but yesterday it took around eight.”
Alagha added that he had to use vegetable oil rather than diesel fuel for the car in which he made the journey to the border crossing.
“So it was quite a funny thing, but we’ve made it,” Alagha toldThe Journal.
“The next day we were at the border at 7am.
“It was a very lengthy process and we finished at the border around 6pm, so we’re talking about nearly 12 hours at the border.
“There are very strict rules and regulations and paperwork.”

Alagha praised the work of the Irish Embassy staff in Cairo and toldThe Journalthat they “did an amazing job”.
“They were waiting for us in Cairo at the border and they did an amazing job helping us, easing the process at the border and also providing some snacks, transportation and accommodation in a car also,” said Alagha.
“I think they did a great job.”
While Alagha said he “can’t wait to go back to our house in Dublin”, he added that he has a “strange feeling” about reaching safety.
“It was a very strange feeling that one night you’re sleeping in darkness and fear and the worst living conditions possible.
“Then the next day, you have plenty of food, you’re safe and in a quiet and nice place, so it’s a very strange feeling.”
Alagha also said that he cried when he left Gaza, crying for the city and people he left behind.
“When the bus left Gaza and the moment it crossed to Egypt, I was crying,” Alagha toldThe Journal.
“I was crying for all the people and friends that I left behind, all the nice memories of a lovely city that has been completely destroyed, for the lives of the nearly 12,000 people so far that have been killed.
“So a lot of mixed feelings.”
Alagha added that even though he witnessed many tragic incidents in Gaza, he is shocked by some of what he has been seeing online since he left Gaza.
“It’s the first time I have stable and good internet and when I open my phone, now I can see a lot of videos and a lot of the reality that I was missing when I was in Gaza, even though I saw a lot of things that made me very sad.”
Tánaiste Micheál Martin isdue to meet with Israel’s foreign minister Eli Cohen today.
Martin said that he will “hopefully” meet with the President of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu also.
He said he will again “stress the urgency of getting all of our citizens out as quick as we possibly can”.
“We will work tirelessly to ensure that all Irish citizens that want to leave Gaza can do so as soon as possible,” the Tánaiste said.
The Tánaiste is also due to meet with the Palestinian Authority today.
He said the priority remains an immediate ceasefire and getting humanitarian aid into Gaza.

UN Security Council calls for 'humanitarian pauses' in Gaza,"
THE UNITED NATIONS Security Council has called for “extended humanitarian pauses” in the Gaza Strip, the first time it has broken its silence since the start of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.
The resolution, prepared by Malta and adopted with 12 votes in favour, “calls for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days” to allow aid to reach civilians in the besieged territory.
Three states abstained – the United States, Britain and Russia.
Diplomats say members waited to schedule a vote until they were relatively sure of success.
After the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas militants, and Israel’s reprisal bombardment of the Gaza Strip, the council tried – in vain – to adopt a resolution of some kind.
But four draftsfailed in October, exposing the body’s long-held divisions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Russia and China on one side and the United States on the other.
Faced with the council’s inability to act, the UN General Assembly on 27 October adopted with a large majority a non-binding text calling for an “immediate humanitarian truce“.
The United States and Israel voted against the text, which did not mention Hamas.

With its ten non-permanent members taking the lead, the Security Council launched new talks on a resolution, but those negotiations got bogged down on the wording to be used to call for a stop, however brief, to the fighting.
The United States opposed any use of the term “ceasefire,” diplomats said. Other terms floated were “truce” and “pause”.
“I know we are all disappointed about the inaction of the Council in the past 40 days,” China’s UN ambassador Jun Zhang said this evening.
The resolution passed this evening mentions children in nearly every paragraph, including “demands that all parties comply with their obligations under international law [...] notably with regard to the protection of civilians, especially children.”
It also calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas militants and other groups, especially children.
Malta’s UN envoy Vanessa Frazier said “the Security Council members are united in wanting a voice.”
While recognizing the “nuances” between their positions, she said all 15 members have “the desire to save life and provide respite” to civilians.

"23 Irish citizens have left Gaza via the Rafah crossing, as Tánaiste vows more will follow","LAST UPDATE|15 Nov 2023
A GROUP OF IRISH citizens have now made the journey out of Gaza and into Egypt via the Rafah crossing.
The group of 23 individuals included Irish citizens and their relatives. Their processing at the border took several hours.
This is the first time that Irish citizens who have been stuck in Gaza since conflict broke out in the region have been able to leave.
Speaking in Cairo this evening, Tánaiste Micheal Martin said the 23 individuals, including children, who made the journey out of Gaza today are “in good form”.
He thanked the Egyptian government for its assistance and said today’s development was good news and that he was relieved but added that there are more Irish citizens to get out of Gaza.
The Tánaiste said he will meet with Israel’s foreign minister Eli Cohen tomorrow and “hopefully” the President of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu.
He said he will again “stress the urgency of getting all of our citizens out as quick as we possibly can”.
“We will work tirelessly to ensure that all Irish citizens that want to leave Gaza can do so as soon as possible,” the Tánaiste said.
The Tánaiste is also due to meet with the Palestinian Authority tomorrow.
He said the priority remains an immediate ceasefire and getting humanitarian aid into Gaza.

“And then we need to focus, as we have today, in some of our preliminary discussions around what happens after this war in terms of getting a political horizon and getting a pathway to peace,” Martin said.
When asked for an update on the case of eight-year-old Irish-Israeli citizen Emily Hand, the Tánaiste said it is clear from his discussions with the Egyptian and Qatari authorities that securing her release from Hamas is a priority.
“There’s been a very genuine response to that and a clear commitment in all of their communications. They are prioritising the case of Emily Hand, that’s pretty clear,” he said.
He said no precise confirmation has been given in relation to Emily’s location and that no definitive proof has been received on whether she is still alive.
The Tánaiste added that Emily’s case was discussed during his meeting with Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry today who provided an update on the work being done.
“There are wider discussions going on and there are other children as well. We think children need to be the number one priority here. And that is our focus,” he said.
Speaking in the Dáil this afternoon, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed that a first group of Irish citizens and their dependents had been cleared to exit through the Rafah crossing.
The Taoiseach said in the Dáil today that he expects additional Irish citizens and dependents in Gaza to be on the list in the coming days.
Micheál Martin today said that the Irish citizens who left Gaza today are travelling to Cairo, where the Irish government has a diplomatic team on the ground, and transport.
“Their wellbeing will be checked, and they will follow on in transit to Ireland,” Martin said.
He added that he is highly appreciative of the role Egypt has played in getting these Irish citizens out of Gaza, but emphasised that equally, it is important that increased aid gets into Gaza, to help citizens who cannot leave.
“We’ve met with the Palestinian Prime Minister, the Egyptian Foreign Minister also the Israeli Ambassador and I know they all had a certain role to play in making today possible and I do want to acknowledge that,” the Taoiseach added.

Not all the Irish citizens who want to leave Gaza have been included in today’s departure list but it is anticipated that they will be granted permission to leave in the coming days, if the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt remains open.
In particular, the two children of Belfast-born Khalid Al-Astal aged three and one, whose mother Ashwak Jendia died from injuries sustained by an Israeli airstrike last month have not been included in today’s list.
Irish citizen Zak Hania and his six family members also have not been included on today’s departure list. Hania was living in Al Shati camp but left northern Gaza for the southern part of the enclave, along with more than tens of thousands of fleeing Palestinian in the previous days.

Not included in today's list is the family of Zak Hania and the young children of Khalid al-Astal, whose wife died from injuries sustained during an Israeli airstrike last month.
The Department confirmed last night that a number Irish citizens in Gaza were expected to be notified that their names were included on a list to leave the territory.
In the list seen byThe Journal, nationals from EU countries including Austria, Sweden and Spain have been included on today’s evacuation list, as well as nationals from Norway, Switzerland, Bahrain, Belarus, Russia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Kazakhstan and Moldova.
In addition, over 80 Palestinian children receiving cancer treatment at Al-Rantisi Hospital have been included.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said there is no indication that Ireland was penalised in the evacuations for its stance on the conflict between Israel and Hamas.
Three Irish citizens working for the UN will remain in Gaza helping to deliver the humanitarian response in the besieged Palestinian enclave where over 11,000 people are now estimated to have died and the majority of the 2.3 million population have been displaced from their homes.
The Rafah border crossing opened on 1 November to allow foreigners and dual nationals to flee the besieged region. It was the first time Egypt has opened the Rafah crossing since the Israel-Hamas conflict began on 7 October.

Explainer: What does it mean to expel an ambassador?,"THE DÁIL IS debating a motion this morning to expel the Israeli ambassador from Ireland in response to the country’s ongoing bombing of Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there.
The motion expresses “revulsion at the continuing collective punishment being meted out to civilians in Gaza by the Israeli government”, as well as condemning the “barbaric attack on Israel on October 7″ and expressing alarm at attacks on and killings of Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7.
The motion, tabled by the Social Democrats, calls on the Government to withdraw diplomatic status from the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland, Dana Erlich, and to push for the imposition of EU-wide economic sanctions on Israel.
Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and People Before Profit have all said they will support the motion, but the Government plans to table a counter motion.
But what does expelling an ambassador entail and how often does it happen in Ireland and elsewhere?
Has it happened before?
While Ireland has previously taken moves to expel less senior diplomats, it has never taken the “very serious” step of sending a state’s ambassador home, according to Donnacha Ó Beacháin, associate professor of politics at Dublin City University.
“It’s something we don’t see often in Ireland, certainly. There’s various kinds of stages to expressing displeasure with a country or an embassy. So for example, at the very bottom of that hierarchy, you have recalling your ambassador for consultation.
“This would mean asking the Irish ambassador to come back from whichever country is in question. That’s a signal that there is unhappiness with what’s going on.”
The next step to express displeasure at a country’s actions is by expelling a diplomat. These are lower-ranked figures in an embassy and expelling them is something Ireland does have form in, Ó Beacháin said.
Most recently, Ireland expelled four Russian diplomats last year over their country’s actions in its invasion of Ukraine, but there are other examples.
“We expelled three Soviet diplomats in 1983, who were allegedly operating a spy ring from the Stillorgan shopping centre of all places,” Ó Beacháin said.
In 2010, Israeli diplomats were expelled after it was discovered that Mossad, the intelligence agency of Israel, had used fake Irish passports as part of a mission to assassinate a high-ranking Hamas figure in Dubai.
But Ó Beacháin noted: “We’ve never gone further than that. In the Troubles,  in 1972, after Bloody Sunday, there was a huge swelling of revulsion against the British government, but we didn’t we didn’t expel the British ambassador.
“We did recall our own ambassador but he stayed away for only two months really. He went back to London when the Northern Ireland government at Stormont was abolished.
“So even when our own country was in question, when relations were at their worst with our nearest neighbour, we didn’t go to the extent of expelling an ambassador. So it is a very big step.”
Why has Ireland not expelled ambassadors before?
Ó Beacháin believes it’s rarely utilised as the work of any embassy is often taken up with helping its country’s own citizens.
If a country expels an ambassador, it could expect the favour to be returned in kind.
Ó Beacháin said ambassadors needed to be thought of less as a “signal of friendship” and instead as ways to “establish basic lines of communication”.

“A major function of having diplomatic relations is just helping Irish people who have gotten into trouble abroad,” he said.
In the case of Israel and Gaza, this may risk the expulsion of the Irish ambassador in Israel.
This could, Ó Beacháin believes, make efforts to ensure the safety of Irish citizens trapped in Gaza more uncertain.
‘Unsavoury regimes’
Ó Beacháin noted that Ireland has embassies and diplomatic relations with “unsavoury governments and regimes” across the world.
“There are dictatorships which don’t allow people to organise freely and which deny civil liberties, but they have representation in Dublin.
“So, if you set the precedent that we are unhappy with a particular government and you expel their ambassador, you establish a precedent which is very difficult to move away from.”
Ireland’s reluctance to resort to expulsion has been consistent, from dealing with Germany during the Second World War to the Soviet Union invading a number of countries following the war.
“After the Soviet Union occupied Eastern Europe, we had several governments in exile in London which claimed to be the legitimate government. And our government in Dublin continued corresponding with these for some time, more out of politeness than anything else,” Ó Beacháin said.
“But they quickly realised that the governments on the ground were the authorities who had real power and they had to establish some relations with them.”
What can expelling an ambassador achieve?
The safety of the approximately 40 Irish citizens in Gaza was raised by Social Democrats’ Foreign Affairs spokesperson Gary Gannon, who yesterday echoed claims made by People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy Israeli government’s refusal to allow their exit was a form of “punishment” because the Irish state had called for a ceasefire.
However, a number ofIrish citizens are leaving Gaza this morning.
Gannon said yesterday that Ireland cannot “stand by and be complicit” with what is happening in Gaza.
Ó Beacháin believes an important factor any country must weigh up when deciding whether to expel an ambassador is what support the move will have internationally – and whether it can alter the offending state’s behaviour.
“It’s a response to a popular feeling that something should be done, but it stems from a feeling of impotence, a feeling that people are unable to do something.”
It would also mean new territory in Ireland’s relations with Israel, and potentially with other states as the bar would be “lowered” for what it takes to expel an ambassador.
However, Ó Beacháin believes expelling an ambassador does leave open the possibility for still retaining diplomats in an embassy and thereby maintain some lines of communication.
“In theory, if your embassy is big enough then it could happen but Ireland’s embassies are traditionally quite small,” he explained.
The danger is for a country to get into a “tit-for-tat” row with another state in expelling personnel.
“We’d risk running out of diplomats very quickly,” he added.

Israeli forces enter Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital where conditions described as horrific,"ISRAELI FORCES HAVE raided Gaza’s largest hospital, targeting what they say is a Hamas command centre in tunnels beneath thousands of patients and civilians seeking refuge from intense combat.
The operation at Gaza City’s Al-Shifa hospital brings to a head weeks of growing concern for the people trapped inside in grim conditions, and marks a key objective for Israel’s campaign to destroy Hamas.
Dozens of Israeli soldiers, some wearing face masks and shooting in the air, ordered young men to surrender, a journalist in contact with AFP said, as the army reported it conducted a “precise and targeted” operation at the facility.
Youssef Abu Rish, an official from the Gaza health ministry who was in the hospital, told AFP he could see tanks inside the complex and “dozens of soldiers and commandos inside the emergency and reception buildings”.
After sharp warnings from the United States and others that Al-Shifa must be protected, Israel said the raid was being executed based on “an operational necessity”.
The United Nations has said it estimates that at least 2,300 people – patients, staff and displaced civilians – are inside and may be unable to escape because of fierce fighting.
Witnesses have described conditions inside the hospital as horrific, with medical procedures taking place without anaesthetic, families with scant food or water living in corridors, and the stench of decomposing corpses filling the air.
“There are bodies littered in the hospital complex and there is no longer electricity at the morgues,” hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiya said prior to the operation.
Anticipating a fierce backlash against the hospital raid, the Israeli military said it had provided evacuation routes for civilians and given authorities in Hamas-run Gaza 12 hours’ notice that any military operation inside must cease.

“Unfortunately, it did not,” the Israeli military said, again calling on “all Hamas terrorists present in the hospital to surrender”.
The Israeli army said its ground teams included medics and Arabic speakers “who have undergone specified training to prepare for this complex and sensitive environment”.
The intent was that “no harm is caused to the civilians being used by Hamas as human shields”, it added.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to its attacks on 7 October, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 240 hostages taken to Gaza.
The health ministry in Gaza says Israel’s ensuing aerial bombardment and ground offensive have killed 11,320 people, mostly civilians, including thousands of children.
Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme this morning that the hospital and its surroundings have been “under attacks” for the last few days, which led to much of the hospital being damaged.
“The hospital has suffered from lack of fuel for the last few days, lack of clean water and also lack of oxygen supply to the ICUs, to the incubators of the babies,” he said.
“About seven babies died because of the lack of oxygen. The other babies have been moved to different units to make sure they are alive and they have survived.”

Al-Mandhari said Israeli authorities “have no right to directly attack the hospital, regardless of their allegations” about Hamas.
“We keep repeating the same thing to all conflicting parties that healthcare is fully protected according to international humanitarian law,” he said.
“Any attack is considered as a breach and it has to be really investigated.”
He described conditions at Gaza’s other hospitals as “very, very bad” and getting worse “every second”.
“Out of the 36 hospitals in Gaza, nine are only functioning partially. Those nine are lacking basic essential supplies fuel, water, food, as well as security.
“The hospitals are closing one-by-one. There are around 9,000 patients with cancer. There are around 1,000 with renal failure. There are around 50,000 pregnant ladies… the situation is very dire.”
The ministry’s Abu Rish called on “the international community and the United Nations to intervene immediately and urgently to stop the Israeli storming operation”.
He said that among the thousands inside the hospital were “650 ailing people and thousands of injured people”.
The White House reiterated its concerns for the safety of civilians shortly after the raid began.
“We do not support striking a hospital from the air and we don’t want to see a firefight in a hospital,” a National Security Council spokesperson said.
The official added that there should not be a situation in which “innocent people, helpless people, sick people trying to get medical care they deserve are caught in the crossfire”.

Earlier, the White House had said that US intelligence sources corroborated Israel’s claim that Hamas and another Palestinian militant group, Islamic Jihad, had buried an operational “command and control node” under Al-Shifa.
Hamas, which has repeatedly denied the claims, today said US President Joe Biden was “wholly responsible” for the assault, accusing his administration of giving Israel “the green light… to commit more massacres against civilians”.
Israel has said that the military use of the hospital “jeopardises” its “protected status under international law”, a claim that many international human rights lawyers refute.
Citing the Gaza health ministry, UN humanitarian agency OCHA said 40 patients had died in Al-Shifa today, while hospital director Abu Salmiya said 179 bodies had been interred in a mass grave inside the complex.
The situation in Gaza’s other hospitals is also dire, with the UN saying 22 of 36 are not functional due to lack of generator fuel, damage and combat.
“The 14 hospitals remaining open have barely enough supplies to sustain critical and life-saving surgeries and provide inpatient care, including intensive care,” the WHO said.
The WHO “has warned that the evacuation of hospitals in the north, as demanded by the Israeli military, would be a ‘death sentence’ for some patients, because operational hospitals in the south cannot admit more patients”, according to an update from OCHA.
The humanitarian crisis also includes 1.5 million people who, according to the UN, have fled southwards after Israel told them to leave the northern half of the territory.

“I walked around three to four kilometres (around two miles) while I was bleeding,” said Hasan Baker, whose head and left hand were bandaged. “There was no possibility for any ambulance to enter the area.”
Irish citizenshave been cleared to evacuate Gazathrough the Rafah border crossing into Egypt today, the Department of Foreign Affairs has confirmed.
This would allow Irish citizens, who have been stuck in Gaza since conflict broke out in the region, to leave for the first time.
Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Micheál Martin is heading to the Middle East today tovisit Egypt, Israel and Palestine in the coming days.
He is expected to meet the Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen in Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
Government sources have said one reason behind the trip, which was scheduled just this week, is to push for the some 40 Irish citizens to be allowed to leave the region.
The Rafah border crossing opened on 1 November to allow foreigners and dual nationals to flee the besieged region. It was the first time Egypt has opened the Rafah crossing since the Israel-Hamas conflict began on 7 October.
Elsewhere, Israeli leaders have so far rejected any calls for a ceasefire in the five-week-old war until hostages are released.
Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, said yesterday that Israel had asked for the release of 100 hostages, while the militants want 200 Palestinian children and 75 women freed from Israeli prisons.
“We informed the mediators we could release the hostages if we obtained five days of truce… and passage of aid to all of our people throughout the Gaza Strip, but the enemy is procrastinating,” Abu Obeida said in an audio statement.
Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed bin Mohammed Al-Ansari, who is helping oversee talks on a hostage deal, said the “deteriorating” situation in Gaza was hampering efforts to find agreement.
With pressure building on the Israeli government, Prime Minister Netanyahu said he was “working relentlessly” to get the hostages out.
Relatives of the hostages set out today on a five-day protest march from Tel Aviv to the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem to call for the captives’ release, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.
The group later demanded the government “approve a deal tonight to bring home all hostages from Gaza”.
US President Biden voiced confidence that a deal could still happen, telling the families of the hostages: “Hang in there. We’re coming.”

UK destroyer downs suspected attack drone 'targeting Red Sea shipping',"
A UK DESTROYER has brought down a suspected attack drone in the Red Sea, British defence minister Grant Shapps said today, amid rising maritime tensions in the region.
Britain announced last month that it was sending HMS Diamond, one of its most advanced naval vessels, to the Gulf to shore up its presence in the region.
“Overnight, HMS Diamond shot down a suspected attack drone which was targeting merchant shipping in the Red Sea. One Sea Viper missile was fired and successfully destroyed the target,” Shapps said in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter.
HMS Diamond, a Type 45 destroyer, is conducting operations to ensure freedom of navigation, reassure merchant vessels and ensure the safe flow of trade, the defence ministry said.

The deployment followed the outbreak of conflict between Israel and Hamas and the seizure of an Israeli-linked cargo vessel by Iranian-backed Yemeni Houthi rebels in the Red Sea on 19 November.
The Houthis have launched a series of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel since Hamas militants poured over the border into Israel on 7 October, killing around 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures. Around 240 people were kidnapped in the attacks.
Vowing to destroy Hamas and bring back the hostages, Israel launched a massive military offensive that the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry says has killed at least 18,800 people, mostly women and children.
Houthi rebels
The Houthi rebels have threatened to attack any vessels heading to Israeli ports unless food and medicine are allowed into the besieged Gaza Strip.
Two of the world’s largest shipping firms, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, said on Friday they were suspending passage through a Red Sea strait vital for global commerce, after the incidents.

Shapps warned today that “the recent spate of illegal attacks represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security in the Red Sea”.
“The UK remains committed to repelling these attacks to protect the free flow of global trade,” he added.
Royal Navy vessels have been permanently deployed to the region since 1980 and since 2011 have fallen under Operation Kipion, the name used for the UK’s maritime presence in the Gulf and the Indian Ocean.
The vessel joined the frigate HMS Lancaster which deployed to the region last year, as well as three mine hunters and a support ship.

"23 Irish citizens have left Gaza via the Rafah crossing, as Tánaiste vows more will follow","LAST UPDATE|15 Nov 2023
A GROUP OF IRISH citizens have now made the journey out of Gaza and into Egypt via the Rafah crossing.
The group of 23 individuals included Irish citizens and their relatives. Their processing at the border took several hours.
This is the first time that Irish citizens who have been stuck in Gaza since conflict broke out in the region have been able to leave.
Speaking in Cairo this evening, Tánaiste Micheal Martin said the 23 individuals, including children, who made the journey out of Gaza today are “in good form”.
He thanked the Egyptian government for its assistance and said today’s development was good news and that he was relieved but added that there are more Irish citizens to get out of Gaza.
The Tánaiste said he will meet with Israel’s foreign minister Eli Cohen tomorrow and “hopefully” the President of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu.
He said he will again “stress the urgency of getting all of our citizens out as quick as we possibly can”.
“We will work tirelessly to ensure that all Irish citizens that want to leave Gaza can do so as soon as possible,” the Tánaiste said.
The Tánaiste is also due to meet with the Palestinian Authority tomorrow.
He said the priority remains an immediate ceasefire and getting humanitarian aid into Gaza.

“And then we need to focus, as we have today, in some of our preliminary discussions around what happens after this war in terms of getting a political horizon and getting a pathway to peace,” Martin said.
When asked for an update on the case of eight-year-old Irish-Israeli citizen Emily Hand, the Tánaiste said it is clear from his discussions with the Egyptian and Qatari authorities that securing her release from Hamas is a priority.
“There’s been a very genuine response to that and a clear commitment in all of their communications. They are prioritising the case of Emily Hand, that’s pretty clear,” he said.
He said no precise confirmation has been given in relation to Emily’s location and that no definitive proof has been received on whether she is still alive.
The Tánaiste added that Emily’s case was discussed during his meeting with Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry today who provided an update on the work being done.
“There are wider discussions going on and there are other children as well. We think children need to be the number one priority here. And that is our focus,” he said.
Speaking in the Dáil this afternoon, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed that a first group of Irish citizens and their dependents had been cleared to exit through the Rafah crossing.
The Taoiseach said in the Dáil today that he expects additional Irish citizens and dependents in Gaza to be on the list in the coming days.
Micheál Martin today said that the Irish citizens who left Gaza today are travelling to Cairo, where the Irish government has a diplomatic team on the ground, and transport.
“Their wellbeing will be checked, and they will follow on in transit to Ireland,” Martin said.
He added that he is highly appreciative of the role Egypt has played in getting these Irish citizens out of Gaza, but emphasised that equally, it is important that increased aid gets into Gaza, to help citizens who cannot leave.
“We’ve met with the Palestinian Prime Minister, the Egyptian Foreign Minister also the Israeli Ambassador and I know they all had a certain role to play in making today possible and I do want to acknowledge that,” the Taoiseach added.

Not all the Irish citizens who want to leave Gaza have been included in today’s departure list but it is anticipated that they will be granted permission to leave in the coming days, if the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt remains open.
In particular, the two children of Belfast-born Khalid Al-Astal aged three and one, whose mother Ashwak Jendia died from injuries sustained by an Israeli airstrike last month have not been included in today’s list.
Irish citizen Zak Hania and his six family members also have not been included on today’s departure list. Hania was living in Al Shati camp but left northern Gaza for the southern part of the enclave, along with more than tens of thousands of fleeing Palestinian in the previous days.

Not included in today's list is the family of Zak Hania and the young children of Khalid al-Astal, whose wife died from injuries sustained during an Israeli airstrike last month.
The Department confirmed last night that a number Irish citizens in Gaza were expected to be notified that their names were included on a list to leave the territory.
In the list seen byThe Journal, nationals from EU countries including Austria, Sweden and Spain have been included on today’s evacuation list, as well as nationals from Norway, Switzerland, Bahrain, Belarus, Russia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Kazakhstan and Moldova.
In addition, over 80 Palestinian children receiving cancer treatment at Al-Rantisi Hospital have been included.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said there is no indication that Ireland was penalised in the evacuations for its stance on the conflict between Israel and Hamas.
Three Irish citizens working for the UN will remain in Gaza helping to deliver the humanitarian response in the besieged Palestinian enclave where over 11,000 people are now estimated to have died and the majority of the 2.3 million population have been displaced from their homes.
The Rafah border crossing opened on 1 November to allow foreigners and dual nationals to flee the besieged region. It was the first time Egypt has opened the Rafah crossing since the Israel-Hamas conflict began on 7 October.

Hamas says White House remarks fuel 'massacres' after it claims militant HQs are in hospitals,"LAST UPDATE|14 Nov 2023
HAMAS HAS SAID that remarks made White House’s that the militant group had a command centre at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza will fuel “massacres” at the facilities.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters today that Hamas operate a “command and control node from Al-Shifa in Gaza City”, citing US intelligence sources.
In response to these claims, Hamas said this gave a “green light” to Israel to commit “brutal massacres” targeting medical facilities in the Palestinian territory.
“These statements give a green light to the Israeli occupation to commit further brutal massacres targeting hospitals, with the goal of destroying Gaza’s healthcare system and displacing Palestinians,” the militant group said in a statement issued in English.
“The United States bears direct responsibility for enabling Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza,” the group added.
Kirby said earlier: “We have information that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad use some hospitals in the Gaza Strip including Al-Shifa and tunnels underneath them to conceal and to support their military operations and to hold hostages.
“We have information that confirms that Hamas is using that particular hospital for a command and control node and probably storage of equipment, weapons… That is a war crime.”
The White House statement, echoed by the State Department and the Pentagon, comes as pressure ramps up on Israel over its blockade of the sprawling Al-Shifa compound, where doctors say patients and people seeking shelter are stranded in horrific conditions.
“They have stored weapons there and they’re prepared to respond to an Israeli military operation against that facility,” he told reporters.
Yesterday, the IDF shared what they deemed proof, on their X, formerly Twitter, account, of hostages being held inside hospitals in Gaza. The health ministry in Gaza has today denied this claim.
The army spokesman, Daniel Hagari, said troops “found signs that indicate that Hamas held hostages” in the basement of Al-Rantisi children’s hospital in Gaza City.
US President Joe Biden said yesterday, after the release from the IDF, that hospitals must be protected and remain safe havens for civilians and medical staff in the area.
AFP journalists on the ground have not been able to independently confirm the allegations from the IDF’s video.
The health ministry in Gaza said the objects merely showed the basement was used by displaced residents fleeing fighting.
In a statement, the ministry said the video was “poor staging” with “not a single piece of evidence” backing the Israeli army claims.
“This basement appeared in the original blueprints of the hospital as a storage area and displaced people found refuge there,” it added.

THE FAMILIES OF Irish-Israeli citizens whose family members were captured as hostages by Hamas on 7 October have met with President Michael D Higgins today.
Thomas and Natali Hand, the father and sister of 8-year-old Emily Hand, and Maya Lambroso, Tal Yeshurun and Eylon Keshet – representing a number of families of those being held as hostages – met with Higgins this afternoon.
Following the meeting, Higgins said the welfare of citizens in Gaza and Israel should be “in the forefront of all of our minds at this time”.
“In our meeting, we discussed what actions can be taken to help ensure the safe return of the hostages to their families,” the President said.
“To this end, I once again call for the unconditional release of all hostages currently being held in Gaza.
“I further echo the call which the families have made that the Red Cross/Red Crescent, or another appropriate organisation, must be given such access to the hostages as will enable their present position to be affirmed,” he added.
Qatar has also urged Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement on releasing hostages, warning that the situation in Gaza was worsening every day.

Speaking to a news conference in Doha, Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed bin Mohammed Al-Ansari said the “deteriorating” situation in Gaza was hampering mediation efforts.
“We believe there is no other chance for both sides other than for this mediation to take place and to reach a situation where we can see a glimmer of hope in this terrible crisis,” he said.
The Israeli Defence Forces earlier today confirmed that the Red Cross has yet to meet Israeli hostages, therefore agencies and world leaders have no proof of life of these hostages.
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen: “Until today, none of our hostages met the Red Cross. We don’t have any proof of life.”
Cohen and Israel’s Health Minister Uriel Menachem Buso met with Mirjana Spoljaric, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to discuss the war that erupted after the October 7 Hamas attacks.
“We asked for information… about the whereabouts of the hostages,” Buso said.
“The wounded ones, the babies, any information that they can give us regarding proof of life.”
The President underlined the need for international law to be respected by all sides and emphasised the importance of the loss of civilian life being brought to an end as soon as possible, and for children in particular to be protected.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with the families yesterday while Tánaiste Micheál Martinwill be travelling to Egypt, Israel and the West Bank later this week.
Martin also met wet Emily Hand’s father, Thomas Hand, today.

Speaking toRTÉ’s News at One, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that the situation in Gaza is “deteriorating rapidly”.
“It is the government’s position for quite some time that there should be a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza to be observed by all sides, by the way, not just Israel, also by Hamas and Islamic Jihad that would allow power, fuel, medicines, aid to get into Gaza. It would allow for hostages to be released, it would allow for citizens to leave and that is our position,” Varadkar said.
The Taoiseach said he spoke to the Israeli ambassador yesterday and was told by her that it is “not the case” that Israel is refusing to let Irish citizens leave Gaza.
“We’re continuing to seek permission for Irish citizens, Irish Palestinian nationals to leave from Gaza. I’m very conscious that we have citizens in Gaza,” he said.
“I’m very conscious that there’s a young Irish girl, nine years old … Emily Hand, who’s being held by Hamas as a hostage.”
Varadkar noted that there are 400 Irish troops on the Israeli border in southern Lebanon, adding that “their safety is paramount”.
Hamas, an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
Israeli leaders have so far insisted there will be no broader ceasefire until hostages are released, but Qatar is mediating talks on a possible deal to free hostages.
Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, said yesterday that a possible deal would involve the release 100 Israeli hostages in return for 200 Palestinian children and 75 women held in Israeli prisons.
“We informed the mediators we could release the hostages if we obtained five days of truce… and passage of aid to all of our people throughout the Gaza Strip, but the enemy is procrastinating,” Abu Obeida said in an audio statement.
Biden said he was “somewhat hopeful” the Qatar-mediated talks could lead to a deal.
As security officials and diplomats continued negotiations, Hamas’s military wing issued a video of captive Israeli soldier Noa Marciano.
The Israeli army on Tuesday confirmed she was dead.
Abu Obeida, the spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, claimed Marciano was killed in an Israeli strike. The Israeli army did not say how she was killed.
US President Joe Biden earlier pressed Israel to protect Gaza’s main hospital, which has been trapped in fierce combat.

The health ministry in Gaza says Israel’s relentless assault has killed 11,240 people, also mostly civilians, including thousands of children – Hamas says it tallies these figures from hospital directors, and they are generally used by international news outlets despite an inability to independently verify them because foreign media and observers have been unable to access the Gaza Strip since the conflict began.
Israeli forces were at the gates of the sprawling Al-Shifa hospital they say sits atop an underground Hamas command base, but the militants deny the charge and doctors say thousands of people are stranded inside in horrific conditions.
“There are bodies littered in the hospital complex and there is no longer electricity at the morgues,” said Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiyah, adding that 179 bodies had been interred so far.
“We were forced to bury them in a mass grave,” he said, adding that seven babies and 29 intensive care patients were among those who had died after fuel for the hospital’s generator ran out.
A witness said the smell of decomposing bodies was everywhere in the facility, but nighttime fighting and air strikes had been less intense compared to previous nights.
The United Nations believes that thousands, and perhaps more than 10,000 people – patients, staff and displaced civilians – may be inside and unable to escape because of fierce fighting nearby.
Médecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) International said today that “bullets were fired” into one of three of its premises located near Al-Shifa hospital and sheltering MSF staff and their families – over 100 people, including 65 children.

Thousands of civilians, medical staff and patients are currently trapped in hospitals and other locations under fire in Gaza city; they must be protected and afforded safe passage if they wish to leave. Above that, there must be a total and immediate ceasefire.
Israel says it is not targeting the hospital, but has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the attacks of 7 October, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, mostly civilians and resulted in 240 hostages being taken to Gaza.
Israel’s military says 47 of its troops have been killed in Gaza.
Biden called on Israel to use “less intrusive action relative to the hospital”, some of his most pointed comments on Israeli operations to date.
“The hospital must be protected,” he told reporters, as international outrage builds over the death and suffering the conflict has inflicted on Gaza civilians.
Israel’s top diplomat acknowledged yesterday that his nation has “two or three weeks until international pressure really steps up”.
Quoted by his spokesman, Foreign Minister Eli Cohen added that Israel is working to “broaden the window of legitimacy, and the fighting will carry on for as long as necessary.”
Hamas’s brutal attacks of 7 October and Israel’s massive response have sparked protests around the world, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets in the Middle East, Europe and beyond.
Israel’s supporters insist it must protect citizens after the worst attack in the country’s 75-year history.
But Israel’s critics point to the toll of a blockade and near-relentless bombing campaign on long-suffering civilians in Gaza.
International aid agencies speak of hundreds of thousands of people displaced and a rolling humanitarian catastrophe.

Israel has urged Palestinians to flee south from the heavy combat in the north of the besieged territory, and has agreed to daily pauses in military operations around specified “corridors” to allow the passage of fleeing civilians.
But escaping the fighting is dangerous and wounded Palestinians told AFP how they were hit by a strike on their way south.
“I walked around three to four kilometres while I was bleeding,” said Hasan Baker, whose head and left hand were bandaged. “There was no possibility for any ambulance to enter the area.
“We didn’t have any weapons,” he added. “We are civilians, we were moving from one place to another according to the instructions of the (Israeli) occupation.”

Anti-immigration groups use Israel-Gaza violence to push antisemitism and Islamophobia online,"LAST UPDATE|15 Nov 2023
IRISH ANTI-IMMIGRATION activists have seized on the ongoing conflict in the Middle East to push racist rhetoric, including antisemitic claims, online.
The wave of hateful speech coincides with Israel’s continuing attack on Gaza. According to the latest figures more than 11,000 people, most of them civilians,have been killed in Gaza since the start of the conflict.
Israel’s attacks were launched after1,200 people, mostly civilians,were killed in raids by Hamas on 7 October. A further 240 people were taken hostage.
The increase in antisemitic tropes comes on the back of a growing prevalence of such messages in recent years – a trend that has become increasingly clear in Ireland.
Anti-immigration activists in Ireland have attempted to use the conflict to incite hatred of Jews or Arabs or, in some cases, both.
Protest
On Thursday last a protest organised by anti-immigration groups was held at Dáil Éireann.
Attendance was small and a number of relatively well-known conspiracy theorists and far-right organisers were amongst those in in attendance, although – similar to September’slarger, more violent protest at Leinster House– various, disparate causes were being championed by those gathered.
Among some, conspiracy theories about Jewish people were repeated.
While the fact wasn’t mentioned by organisers in any of the promotional material shared online about the protest, it happened to coincide with both the hundredth anniversary of Hitler’s failed Beer Hall Putsch and the 85th anniversary of 1938′s Kristallnacht, where Nazi paramilitaries attacked Jews in Germany killing at least 91 people.
“They are pretending that they are afraid after they have injected the Irish population with poison,” one man at the protest could be heard to shout into a megaphone in livestreams of the event, apparently referring to disproven claims that Covid-19 vaccines were dangerous.
“And they’re now trying to act as victims. The same as the Jews pretend they’re the victim,” he continued.
“Europe is next! A Jewish agenda to poison the world! A Jewish agenda to destroy our economy! A Jewish agenda that runs the central banks!”
Jewish people have long been the target of conspiracy theories – including through the Middle Ages where baseless accusations of blasphemy and ritual murder led to massacres of Jewish people across Europe.
Similarly baseless allegations that Jews had taken control of Germany in a plot to weaken it helped the Nazis come to power and, ultimately, led to the murder of millions of European Jews in the Holocaust.
A renewed interest in conspiracy theories during the Covid-19 pandemic also saw an increase in online antisemitism, according to aEuropean Commission study, and the result of which could be seen amongst some of the protesters on Thursday in Dublin.
The study identified a surge in antisemitic content, including “conspiracy theories presenting vaccines as a Jewish plot to sterilise or control populations” as the pandemic spread.
“During the early months of the pandemic, there was a fast evolving narrative landscape of antisemitic conspiracies, with Jewish communities first being blamed for the creation of the virus, then blamed for its spread,” the study found.
“With the roll-out of vaccine programmes in Europe, antisemitism began to shift and expand, with a proliferation of online antisemitic narratives presenting vaccines as an instrument of Jewish control of populations or the presenting of trivialised comparisons between the Holocaust and vaccine programmes.”
Last September, an Irish Holocaust education groupwrote tothe Justice Minister about antisemitism in The Irish Light, a conspiracy theory newspaper edited by activist and former national newspaper journalist Gemma O’Doherty.
The Irish Light regularly contains conspiracies about Covid-19, vaccines, asylum seekers and migrants, as well as the Great Replacement theory, a white nationalist, far-right conspiracy which claims white citizens are being replaced by non-white populations.
The Institute of Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a counter-extremism think-tank, reported a further increase in bothantisemiticand andanti-Muslimdiscourse online since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict in early October.

“ISD identified a 51-fold increase (4,963%) in antisemitic comments on YouTube and a 422% increase in language associated with anti-Muslim hate on X when compared to the days prior to the attack,” Ciaran O’Connor, a senior analyst with ISD said, noting that similar spikes were found across other social media platforms too.
“Extremists across the spectrum are using the conflict to further their own interests and ideologies — they are opportunists and some view the conflict as a perfect storm to ignite or revive racist and hateful claims and promote their own divisive, polarising and harmful agendas.”
Real-world antisemitism
However this hate against Jewish people has not been restricted to the internet or small-scale rallies.
The Russian region of Dagestan has seen anantisemitic riot, while closer to home, France has recorded1,040 anti-Semitic actssince 7 October and London police figures indicatea huge surgein antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents in the English capital compared with the previous year.
There have also beenaccusations, echoed in numerous pieces published in the Jerusalem Post, that Ireland, which has tended to sympathise with the Palestinian cause, is especially antisemitic.
In contrast, surveys carried out by the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish anti-extremism group, suggests Ireland is less antisemitic than average compared with eitherWestern Europeor the rest of the world.
There have been elaborate arguments over what statements are implicitly antisemitic, and which instead count as legitimate criticisms of Israel or expressions of support for Palestinians. One phrase – often heard as a chant – that has been particularly controversial isthe expression“from the River to the Sea”.
Some pro-Palestinian groups have said that false accusations of antisemitism have been used tosuppress criticismof Israel’s policies.
However, a number of Irish anti-immigration groups have ramped up rhetoric that is unquestionably and explicitly hateful against Jewish people, sometimes simultaneously as they denigrate Arabs and Muslims.
“Jews are working especially to destroy Ireland,” a popular post on one new Irish Telegram group reads.
“Not only for our anti-Israel stance or our Catholicism but because we are the Whitest Nation in the World.”
The group has more than 700 members and is regularly filled with antisemitic and other racist content.
Posts from the group have been shared by influential conspiracy theory activists, such as Philip Dwyer, an anti-immigration activist and a self-described citizen journalist.
Dwyer has shared more than a dozen posts about Jews since the early October attacks, some of which which claimed that Jews control the west, that immigration is a Jewish plot, or that “Judaism at it’s[sic]core is about the Genocide of non-Jews”.
Dwyer’s Telegram channel has more than 3,100 subscribers and is promoted on his other social media channels. His X.com account has not posted the same antisemitic content, but has shared calls to unban Nick Fuentes, an AmericanWhite Supremacistwho praises Hitler.
Prior to October, Dwyer regularly shared posts that targeted Arabs and Muslims.
Separate to Dwyer, other active Irish conspiracy theorists have also put up posts that use antisemitic slurs, argue that the Holocaust didn’t happen, or include links to a neo-Nazi message board thatactively encourages violenceagainst Jews, as well as other minorities and women.
Another group with thousands of members shared claims that Jewish people were responsible for the “LGBT agenda”, noting that ancient Jewish thought recognisedmore gendersthan just male and female.
On 7 October, the day that 1,400 Israelis were killed in the attack by Hamas militants, a link to an antisemitic conspiracy theory calling modern Jews a “synagogue of Satan” (a term from the Bible regularly used by antisemites) was shared in another Irish fringe Telegram group with more than 8,200 members.
“Let the Jews and Arabs kill each other if they want,” a more recent post in the same group said, responding to accusations that racism against Jews may be growing in Ireland.
“Ballooning Antisemitism in Ireland[?] the left are far right now, you couldn’t make it up.”
Racist tropes
The Journalwas able to identify at least six fringe Irish Telegram groups spreading antisemitism that have posted more messages containing the word “Jew” since 7 October than they had in the previous ten months of the year.

All of these groups had at least a hundred subscribers; some had thousands.
Another Telegram channel, run by a prominent far-right Irish figure posting as ‘Keith Woods’ has also made multiple posts denigrating Jewish people and Judaism to his more-than-26,500 Telegram followers since 7 October. Woods, in a since deleted tweet, has described himself as an anti-semite.
However, while the volume of these posts has increased, the channel has consistently been posting such content throughout the year.
Woods appears to be influential with well-known figures popular among the far-right. Tweets posted by Woods about Ireland’s proposed hate speech bill have been shared by Donald Trump Jr and Jordan Peterson, while Elon Musk has responded to Woods multiple times, often for his criticisms of the Anti-Defamation League.
Elsewhere on Telegram other Irish fringe groups, some also with thousands of members, had no noticeable surge in antisemitic comments.
“Antisemitism in Ireland always been there, promoted and pushed by fringe groups and far right influencers,” a spokesperson for the Hope and Courage Collective, an Irish anti-bigotry group, toldThe Journal.
“Post-7th of October, antisemitic organisers are foregrounding their arguments and conspiracies in the context of the attacks in Gaza, which the vast majority of people in Ireland are repulsed by.
“Those promoting antisemitism are much more ‘masks off’.”
Similar searches in for words like “Arab” and “Muslim” in fringe Telegram groups did not produce such clear-cut results – though largely because some groups had been posting anti-Muslim content consistently since before 7 October.
Ciarán O’Connor toldThe Journal: “Far-right actors, both in Ireland and internationally, have mostly reacted to the conflict by exploiting the situation as an opportunity to share racist tropes that reinforce existing dehumanising and distrustful perspectives about Muslims, typically portraying these as inherently violent, and Jews, typically portraying these (in line with global Jewish conspiracies) as sinister, powerful and coercive.
“There have been instances too of far-right actors openly supporting or sympathising with Palestinians or Israelis affected by the conflict,” O’Connor said.
“But these are often purely superficial and insincere attempts to capitalise on the conflict as an opportunity to further denigrate Muslims or Jews.”
The conflict in Gaza has also led to further discord between rival Irish anti-immigration groups, with activists that have expressed pro-Israel comments being accused of being part of a “controlled opposition” — referring to protest movements set up by the political establishment to siphon support from more extreme groups.
The same charge was also made against both The Irish Inquiry and Gript.ie, media outlets whose work has previously been shared in anti-immigration groups.
“Gript [are] making the case that Irish people shouldn’t be allowed to Criticise Jews or Israel for their behaviour in any way as it’s ‘anti-semitic’,” a post in an Irish antisemitic Telegram group alleges.
“The purpose of Gript [is the] same as all other controlled opposition. [It] is to suck you in, to lead you down the harmless path.”
The editor of Gript.ie had publishedpiecesdefendingIsraeland its actions in Gaza, both prior to and since 7 October.
In the same Telegram group, Hermann Kelly, the leader of the Irish Freedom Party, was also accused of being “controlled opposition” for not criticising Israel.
Instead his X.com account regularly posts content critical of Muslims, including one saying “Muslims are taught to hate, dominate or annihilate all non-muslims” next to a number of images, including one of a war scene with an Israeli flag.
Irish Telegram channels that carry antisemitic content often also include anti-Muslim messages. “Hamas are Islamists and no, we don’t want Islam or Arabs coming to Ireland,” one post that goes on to denounce “Jewish power” reads.
“There has been a noted trend towards increased Islamophobia and antisemitism in recent years,” concludes Dr Eileen Culloty, assistant professor in the DCU School of Communications and deputy director of the Institute for Media, Democracy and Society.
“Over that time, there have been intense debates about what is or isn’t Islamophobia or antisemitic,” she toldThe Journal.
“When you combine those two trends with social media, which has no room for nuance or depth and privileges fast responses, the result is a complex mess.”

Hamas says White House remarks fuel 'massacres' after it claims militant HQs are in hospitals,"LAST UPDATE|14 Nov 2023
HAMAS HAS SAID that remarks made White House’s that the militant group had a command centre at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza will fuel “massacres” at the facilities.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters today that Hamas operate a “command and control node from Al-Shifa in Gaza City”, citing US intelligence sources.
In response to these claims, Hamas said this gave a “green light” to Israel to commit “brutal massacres” targeting medical facilities in the Palestinian territory.
“These statements give a green light to the Israeli occupation to commit further brutal massacres targeting hospitals, with the goal of destroying Gaza’s healthcare system and displacing Palestinians,” the militant group said in a statement issued in English.
“The United States bears direct responsibility for enabling Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza,” the group added.
Kirby said earlier: “We have information that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad use some hospitals in the Gaza Strip including Al-Shifa and tunnels underneath them to conceal and to support their military operations and to hold hostages.
“We have information that confirms that Hamas is using that particular hospital for a command and control node and probably storage of equipment, weapons… That is a war crime.”
The White House statement, echoed by the State Department and the Pentagon, comes as pressure ramps up on Israel over its blockade of the sprawling Al-Shifa compound, where doctors say patients and people seeking shelter are stranded in horrific conditions.
“They have stored weapons there and they’re prepared to respond to an Israeli military operation against that facility,” he told reporters.
Yesterday, the IDF shared what they deemed proof, on their X, formerly Twitter, account, of hostages being held inside hospitals in Gaza. The health ministry in Gaza has today denied this claim.
The army spokesman, Daniel Hagari, said troops “found signs that indicate that Hamas held hostages” in the basement of Al-Rantisi children’s hospital in Gaza City.
US President Joe Biden said yesterday, after the release from the IDF, that hospitals must be protected and remain safe havens for civilians and medical staff in the area.
AFP journalists on the ground have not been able to independently confirm the allegations from the IDF’s video.
The health ministry in Gaza said the objects merely showed the basement was used by displaced residents fleeing fighting.
In a statement, the ministry said the video was “poor staging” with “not a single piece of evidence” backing the Israeli army claims.
“This basement appeared in the original blueprints of the hospital as a storage area and displaced people found refuge there,” it added.

THE FAMILIES OF Irish-Israeli citizens whose family members were captured as hostages by Hamas on 7 October have met with President Michael D Higgins today.
Thomas and Natali Hand, the father and sister of 8-year-old Emily Hand, and Maya Lambroso, Tal Yeshurun and Eylon Keshet – representing a number of families of those being held as hostages – met with Higgins this afternoon.
Following the meeting, Higgins said the welfare of citizens in Gaza and Israel should be “in the forefront of all of our minds at this time”.
“In our meeting, we discussed what actions can be taken to help ensure the safe return of the hostages to their families,” the President said.
“To this end, I once again call for the unconditional release of all hostages currently being held in Gaza.
“I further echo the call which the families have made that the Red Cross/Red Crescent, or another appropriate organisation, must be given such access to the hostages as will enable their present position to be affirmed,” he added.
Qatar has also urged Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement on releasing hostages, warning that the situation in Gaza was worsening every day.

Speaking to a news conference in Doha, Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed bin Mohammed Al-Ansari said the “deteriorating” situation in Gaza was hampering mediation efforts.
“We believe there is no other chance for both sides other than for this mediation to take place and to reach a situation where we can see a glimmer of hope in this terrible crisis,” he said.
The Israeli Defence Forces earlier today confirmed that the Red Cross has yet to meet Israeli hostages, therefore agencies and world leaders have no proof of life of these hostages.
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen: “Until today, none of our hostages met the Red Cross. We don’t have any proof of life.”
Cohen and Israel’s Health Minister Uriel Menachem Buso met with Mirjana Spoljaric, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to discuss the war that erupted after the October 7 Hamas attacks.
“We asked for information… about the whereabouts of the hostages,” Buso said.
“The wounded ones, the babies, any information that they can give us regarding proof of life.”
The President underlined the need for international law to be respected by all sides and emphasised the importance of the loss of civilian life being brought to an end as soon as possible, and for children in particular to be protected.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with the families yesterday while Tánaiste Micheál Martinwill be travelling to Egypt, Israel and the West Bank later this week.
Martin also met wet Emily Hand’s father, Thomas Hand, today.

Speaking toRTÉ’s News at One, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that the situation in Gaza is “deteriorating rapidly”.
“It is the government’s position for quite some time that there should be a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza to be observed by all sides, by the way, not just Israel, also by Hamas and Islamic Jihad that would allow power, fuel, medicines, aid to get into Gaza. It would allow for hostages to be released, it would allow for citizens to leave and that is our position,” Varadkar said.
The Taoiseach said he spoke to the Israeli ambassador yesterday and was told by her that it is “not the case” that Israel is refusing to let Irish citizens leave Gaza.
“We’re continuing to seek permission for Irish citizens, Irish Palestinian nationals to leave from Gaza. I’m very conscious that we have citizens in Gaza,” he said.
“I’m very conscious that there’s a young Irish girl, nine years old … Emily Hand, who’s being held by Hamas as a hostage.”
Varadkar noted that there are 400 Irish troops on the Israeli border in southern Lebanon, adding that “their safety is paramount”.
Hamas, an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
Israeli leaders have so far insisted there will be no broader ceasefire until hostages are released, but Qatar is mediating talks on a possible deal to free hostages.
Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, said yesterday that a possible deal would involve the release 100 Israeli hostages in return for 200 Palestinian children and 75 women held in Israeli prisons.
“We informed the mediators we could release the hostages if we obtained five days of truce… and passage of aid to all of our people throughout the Gaza Strip, but the enemy is procrastinating,” Abu Obeida said in an audio statement.
Biden said he was “somewhat hopeful” the Qatar-mediated talks could lead to a deal.
As security officials and diplomats continued negotiations, Hamas’s military wing issued a video of captive Israeli soldier Noa Marciano.
The Israeli army on Tuesday confirmed she was dead.
Abu Obeida, the spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, claimed Marciano was killed in an Israeli strike. The Israeli army did not say how she was killed.
US President Joe Biden earlier pressed Israel to protect Gaza’s main hospital, which has been trapped in fierce combat.

The health ministry in Gaza says Israel’s relentless assault has killed 11,240 people, also mostly civilians, including thousands of children – Hamas says it tallies these figures from hospital directors, and they are generally used by international news outlets despite an inability to independently verify them because foreign media and observers have been unable to access the Gaza Strip since the conflict began.
Israeli forces were at the gates of the sprawling Al-Shifa hospital they say sits atop an underground Hamas command base, but the militants deny the charge and doctors say thousands of people are stranded inside in horrific conditions.
“There are bodies littered in the hospital complex and there is no longer electricity at the morgues,” said Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiyah, adding that 179 bodies had been interred so far.
“We were forced to bury them in a mass grave,” he said, adding that seven babies and 29 intensive care patients were among those who had died after fuel for the hospital’s generator ran out.
A witness said the smell of decomposing bodies was everywhere in the facility, but nighttime fighting and air strikes had been less intense compared to previous nights.
The United Nations believes that thousands, and perhaps more than 10,000 people – patients, staff and displaced civilians – may be inside and unable to escape because of fierce fighting nearby.
Médecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) International said today that “bullets were fired” into one of three of its premises located near Al-Shifa hospital and sheltering MSF staff and their families – over 100 people, including 65 children.

Thousands of civilians, medical staff and patients are currently trapped in hospitals and other locations under fire in Gaza city; they must be protected and afforded safe passage if they wish to leave. Above that, there must be a total and immediate ceasefire.
Israel says it is not targeting the hospital, but has vowed to destroy Hamas in response to the attacks of 7 October, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, mostly civilians and resulted in 240 hostages being taken to Gaza.
Israel’s military says 47 of its troops have been killed in Gaza.
Biden called on Israel to use “less intrusive action relative to the hospital”, some of his most pointed comments on Israeli operations to date.
“The hospital must be protected,” he told reporters, as international outrage builds over the death and suffering the conflict has inflicted on Gaza civilians.
Israel’s top diplomat acknowledged yesterday that his nation has “two or three weeks until international pressure really steps up”.
Quoted by his spokesman, Foreign Minister Eli Cohen added that Israel is working to “broaden the window of legitimacy, and the fighting will carry on for as long as necessary.”
Hamas’s brutal attacks of 7 October and Israel’s massive response have sparked protests around the world, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets in the Middle East, Europe and beyond.
Israel’s supporters insist it must protect citizens after the worst attack in the country’s 75-year history.
But Israel’s critics point to the toll of a blockade and near-relentless bombing campaign on long-suffering civilians in Gaza.
International aid agencies speak of hundreds of thousands of people displaced and a rolling humanitarian catastrophe.

Israel has urged Palestinians to flee south from the heavy combat in the north of the besieged territory, and has agreed to daily pauses in military operations around specified “corridors” to allow the passage of fleeing civilians.
But escaping the fighting is dangerous and wounded Palestinians told AFP how they were hit by a strike on their way south.
“I walked around three to four kilometres while I was bleeding,” said Hasan Baker, whose head and left hand were bandaged. “There was no possibility for any ambulance to enter the area.
“We didn’t have any weapons,” he added. “We are civilians, we were moving from one place to another according to the instructions of the (Israeli) occupation.”

Simon Harris says Israel is now 'blinded by rage' and engaging in a 'war on children' in Gaza,"LAST UPDATE|14 Nov 2023
ISRAEL HAS BEEN ‘blinded by rage’ and is now engaging in a “war on children” in Gaza, Minister Simon Harris has said in the Dáil.
Harris made the comments while filling in for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for today’s Leaders’ Questions.
He said what began as an act of defence by Israel has progressed into a “war on children”.
“There’s absolutely no doubt that what Hamas did was despicable. We’ve all condemned it, it deserves condemnation. It was an act of terror on the people of Israel, it should be condemned and of course, Israel had a right to defend itself.
“But that original right to defend itself has now become in my view a war on children. And you cannot build peace on the mass graves of children. It is unfortunate that the country has become blinded by rage,” Harris said.
Harris was responding to a question from Labour leader Ivana Bacik who asked if the Government would be supporting the Social Democrats’ motion to expel the Israeli ambassador.

“We differ in relation to our view on the ambassador and we differ very clearly,” the Minister for Higher Education responded.
He said diplomacy is not the equivalent of endorsement and pointed to the approximately 40 Irish citizens that remain trapped in Gaza, including eight year old Emily Hand, and the 400 Irish troops in the region as key reasons to maintain diplomatic relations with Israel.
“We have to be conscious of the fact that there’s an Irish-Israeli girl currently held hostage by Hamas. So we need to keep talking.
“We know that if we expelled the ambassador here, they’d expect our ambassador there and it would make it a lot less productive in terms of the work that we have to do,” Harris said.
When asked if the Tánaiste agreed with Harris’s comments this evening, a spokesperson for Micheál Martin said that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has been clear on his position to date.
He said Israel has a right to defend itself but it must show proportionality in that response.
“We urge very strongly deescalation and we urge an urgent ceasefire for humanitarian purposes,” the spokesperson said.

Govt announce additional funding for ICC as Sinn Féin call for Israel's referral to the court,"LAST UPDATE|14 Nov 2023
THE GOVERNMENT HAS announced that it has agreed to commit additional funding for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to support its work.
The announcement has come as part of its counter-motion to Sinn Féin’s motion this evening to refer Israel to the ICC.
The amount of funding being provided has not been announced but a Government spokesperson has said it will be “significant” with full details to be announced in the coming days.
Sinn Féin are this evening bringing a motion to the floor of the Dáil calling on the Government to refer the Israeli attacks in Gaza to the ICC for investigation.
The Sinn Féin motion is being supported by Social Democrats, People Before Profit and Labour.
The Government will however propose a counter-motion which will not endorse a referral to the ICC but instead will note that the ICC is the “cornerstone” of the system of international criminal justice and not only promotes and upholds the rule of law but also pursues accountability for the most serious international crimes.
The counter-motion will recognise that the Prosecutor of the ICC announced the opening of an investigation into the situation in Palestine in March 2021.
The Prosecutor of the ICC, Karim Khan, has reaffirmed that this investigation covers the current, ongoing conflict.
The Prosecutor has also stated that his only objective must be to achieve justice for the victims whether they are in Israel or Palestine.
The Government’s counter motion will also call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, and for the unconditional adherence by all parties to their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law.
Earlier today, Social Democrats’ Foreign Affairs spokesperson Gary Gannon said Ireland has the opportunity to act as a leader in Europe by expelling the Israeli ambassador and imposing economic sanctions.
Speaking to reporters outside Leinster House today, Gannon said Ireland should “not be content with having the least bloody hands in the room” when it comes to the global response to Israel’s bombing of Gaza.
Tomorrow, the Social Democrats will bring a motion forward calling on the Government to withdraw diplomatic status from the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich and push for the imposition of EU-wide economic sanctions on Israel.
Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and People Before Profit have all said they will support the motion, however the Government plans to table a counter motion.

Among the calls from the Social Democrats is for the human rights clause in the EU-Israel trade deal to be enacted.
This clause means that either side can unilaterally suspend the agreement in response to serious breaches of human rights.
They also want Ireland to put its name to the report to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations by Israel and for the Occupied Territories Bill to be enacted.
Gannon said the party understands the “enormity” of the call to cut diplomatic relations with Israel but said Ireland cannot “stand by and be complicit” with what is happening in Gaza.
“I don’t think it’s appropriate for the Irish state to stand back and be content with having the least bloody hands in the room. I think our position can be stronger and that’s why we’re making these calls,” he said.
On Tánaiste Micheál Martin’splanned visit to Israel and Palestinethis week, Gannon said he is “intrigued by it”.
He said: “Is there any other state which would be engaged in what’s been described as an impending genocide that the Tánaiste would go visit and shake their hands, all the while hospitals are being burnt, broken and bombed?”
“I understand the Tánaiste is aspiring to find diplomatic solutions there and that is his role. I don’t want to criticise that but I also don’t want to stand back and be a useful apologist for what is happening in Gaza,” Gannon added.
Gannon also questioned if the Israeli government’s refusal to allow the exit of approximately 40 Irish citizens from Gaza is a “form of punishment” against these citizens because the Irish state has “been an outlier in terms of asking simply for a ceasefire”.
He said he believes this is the case.
“For me, it really does seem like those citizens are being punished because the Taoiseach, because the Tánaiste have gone a little bit further in terms of their condemnation,” he said.
The same claim was made recently in the Dáil by People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy.
In response, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Ireland has been given no indication its citizens are being prevented from leaving Gaza as a form of punishment for calling for a ceasefire.
Meanwhile, People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith urged the Government today to allow a free vote on both Israel related motions arguing that they are issues of conscience.
Smith said she is aware of TDs within the Government parties who have privately supported the idea of expelling the Israeli ambassador.
“Many of them feel much stronger than they’ve been represented by their party leaders, by the Tánaiste and by the Taoiseach, and want something much more interventionist done,” she said.

US President says Gaza hospitals must be 'protected' as doctors warn patients are trapped,"LAST UPDATE|13 Nov 2023

US PRESIDENT JOE Biden today urged Israel to protect Gaza’s main hospital as heavy fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas raged around the complex.
“It’s my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action relative to the hospital,” Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if he had expressed concerns to Israel on the issue.
“The hospital must be protected.”
Biden, who spoke as he was signing a women’s health research initiative alongside First Lady Jill Biden, added that he was “in contact with the Israelis” on the matter.
He said that a deal for the “release of prisoners” was still being negotiated with the help of the Gulf state of Qatar.
A surgeon with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the medical charity group, said that hundreds of people were stranded in the Al-Shifa hospital complex enduring “inhuman” conditions.
Israel argues that its Hamas enemies built their military headquarters under the Al-Shifa hospital – a charge Hamas denies – while UN agencies and doctors in the facility warned that a lack of generator fuel was claiming lives, including those of infants.
The World Health Organization in the Palestinian territories earlier today said that at least 2,300 people – patients, health workers and people fleeing fighting – were inside the crippled Al-Shifa facility.
The Israeli army has pushed on with its military campaign, but it is facing intense international pressure to minimize civilian suffering amid its massive air and ground operations, which Hamas authorities say have killed 11,180 people, including 4,609 children.
Fuel shortages
the hospitals in northern Gaza have been forced out of service amid fuel shortages and intense combat, with the death toll inside the territory’s largest facility rising, the Hamas-run health ministry said today.
Witnesses reported intense overnight air strikes, with tanks and armoured vehicles just meters from the gate of the sprawling Al-Shifa compound at the heart of the Gaza City, now an urban war zone.
The Hamas government’s deputy health minister Youssef Abu Rish said the death toll inside Al-Shifa rose to 27 adult intensive care patients and seven babies since the weekend as the facility suffered fuel shortages.
Gaza has been reliant on generators for over a month after Israel cut off power supplies following the October 7 attack and the besieged territory’s only power plant ran out of fuel.
Abu Rish told AFP all hospitals in the north of the embattled territory were “out of service”.
The World Health Organization in the Palestinian Territories said early Monday that at least 2,300 people – patients, health workers and people fleeing fighting – were inside the crippled Al-Shifa.
“There are dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded that no one can get to. Ambulances are at a standstill because they get shot at when they go out,” hospital director Muhammad Abu Selmiya said.
Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh today called on the European Union and the United Nations to “parachute aid” into the Gaza Strip.
“I call on the United Nations and the European Union to parachute aid into the Gaza Strip, especially the north,” he said, referring to the area where fighting is most intense.
Israel is facing intense international pressure to minimise civilian suffering amid a massive air and ground operation that Hamas authorities say has already killed 11,240 people, including 4,630 children.
Foreign officials like EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell have urged Israel to show “maximum restraint”, while condemning Hamas for using “hospitals and civilians as human shields.”
Israel’s military said it would observe a “self-evacuation corridor” today, allowing people to move from Al-Shifa southward, but admitted the area was still the scene of “intense battles.”
The area of fighting “currently includes the area surrounding the Shifa hospital but not the hospital itself”, a spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces told AFP.
Tens of thousands of Gazans have already fled from the north of the territory under Israeli orders.
But it is unclear what, if any, provisions there would be for the sick and injured to be transported from Al-Shifa.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned today its operations in war-torn Gaza would shut down within two days due to fuel shortages as fighting rages between Israel and Hamas.
“The humanitarian operation in Gaza will grind to a halt in the next 48 hours as no fuel is allowed to enter Gaza,” UNRWA’s Gaza chief Thomas White wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
The Israeli army said its ground soldiers had hand-delivered 300 litres of fuel to the hospital “for urgent medical purposes”.
The military shared grainy night-time footage of combat troops hauling jerry cans, leaving a dozen or more outside a building.

AFP was unable to independently verify the footage, or Israel’s claim that Hamas “forbade the hospital from taking it.”
Only a handful of trucks carrying fuel had been let into Gaza since 7 October, with Israel concerned fuel deliveries would be used by Hamas militants.
Al-Shifa director Mohammad Abu Salmiya told journalists the Israeli claims were “lies”.
The 300 litres the army said had been delivered would power generators for “no more than quarter of an hour” anyway, Abu Salmiya said.
The EU’s humanitarian aid chief today called for “meaningful” pauses in the fighting in Gaza and urgent deliveries of fuel to keep hospitals working in the territory.
“It is urgent to define and respect humanitarian pauses,” Janez Lenarcic, European Commissioner for Crisis Management, said at a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Brussels.
“Fuel needs to get in. As you could see, more than half of the hospitals in the Gaza Strip stopped working, primarily because of lack of fuel, and fuel is desperately needed.”
The EU’s 27 countries issued a statement yesterday saying hospitals “must be protected” and condemning Hamas for using the medical facilities and civilians as “human shields”.
The bloc demanded “immediate humanitarian pauses” to allow desperately needed aid into the besieged territory.
“These pauses have to be meaningful,” Lenarcic said.
“First of all, they have to be announced well in advance of the implementation so organisations can prepare to exploit them. Second, they have to be clearly defined time-wise.”
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell insisted that “Gaza needs more aid from any point of view”.
“Water, fuel, food. This aid is available, is in the border waiting to come in,” he said.
Luxembourg’s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, said that hospitals in Gaza should not be turned into “battlefields”.
“Patients who are in intensive care units have no chance,” he said.
“There is no more oxygen, there is no more water, there are no more medicines. So these people are going to die.”
Dwindling supplies
Inside the hospital, AFP last week witnessed the sick and injured on gurneys that packed corridor walls.
The courtyard of the emergency ward was dotted with people and piles of rubbish lay uncollected.
Some of the thousands displaced by the fighting camped at the facility using make-shift kitchens and what few supplies they had.
Across Gaza City at the Al-Quds hospital the picture was also said to be dire, with the Palestinian Red Crescent warning it was now out of service due to a lack of generator fuel.
Twenty of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are “no longer functioning”, according to the UN’s humanitarian agency.
Almost 1.6 million people – about two-thirds of Gaza’s population – have been internally displaced since 7 October, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out calls for the ceasefire, saying Hamas must first release the estimated 240 hostages taken on 7 October.
Israelis are still stunned by the worst attack in their country’s history and preoccupied with the fate of those still missing.
A recent poll by the Israel Democracy Institute showed many Israelis back talks with Hamas to secure the release of hostages, but believe fighting should not be halted.
Netanyahu told US media that “there could be” a deal to free the hostages, but stopped short of providing any details.
“The less I say about it, the more I’ll increase the chances that it materialises,” he told NBC.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told MSNBC there has been “active negotiation” on a potential deal but kept mum on any details, while a Palestinian official in Gaza accused Israel of dragging its feet.
“Netanyahu is responsible for the delay and obstacles in reaching a preliminary agreement on the release of several prisoners,” the official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

‘Our bodies hurt from crying’ say family of Irish-Israeli girl feared kidnapped,"THE IRISH FATHER of an eight-year-old Israeli girl who is feared taken to Gaza has asked for a renewed focus on the Israeli hostages taken to Gaza.
Emily Handwas originally feared dead after the Hamas assault on Kibbutz Be’eri in Israel on 7 October.
However, the eight-year-old’s family have been informed she may still be alive and being held hostage by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
On 7 October,Hamas launched thousands of rockets and militants killed 1,400 Israeli civilians, as well as taking an estimated 200 other citizens hostage to Gaza.
Israel has responded with missile attacks and a blockade on the war-torn enclave, as part of an operation to target Hamas’s leaders and operations.
More than 11,000 people have been killed in the region and aid agencies have warned that low supplies of food, water and medicines are creating an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.

Today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with Emily’s family.
Thomas Hand,originally from Dun Laoghaire in Dublin, described his daughter Emily as a “fun-loving child” who loves music, dancing and singing.
“Even my dog misses her. She used to use him as a pillow, stick her head down and fall asleep. Funny, the things that you miss, and now she’s kidnapped in Gaza along with many others.
“I want to hug Emily again, love her, fix her.”
He was speaking in Dublin on Monday after travelling there along with his older daughter Natali in order “to drum up as much sympathy and support” as possible.
Similar events are being held in other Israeli embassies to raise the case of citizens feared kidnapped during the attack over a month ago.
Imagining being reunited with Emily, he said: “I’m going to hold her forever. I’m never going to let her go.”

He said he is “very happy” with the Irish government’s efforts to free hostages, and said they have been doing “a lot”, adding that the Irish ambassador to Israel, Sonya McGuinness, had visited them to give them the “little information” she had.
Asked whether he is afraid of rockets being launched in Gaza while his daughter is in the enclave, he said: “I’m sure Emily was taken by the Hamas, not the Palestinian people, by the Hamas – and they’ll be safe down in the tunnels with the Hamas, they’ll be safe down there.”
He added: “I feel sorry for the Palestinian people. They’re suffering for what the Hamas is doing to them. They say that we’re the occupiers, we’re not the occupiers, Hamas is the occupiers.”
Natali Hand said she was in Australia when the Hamas attack happened, and got a video call from Emily who told her that her friend’s house, where she had been staying the night, was burning.
“She was asking me why I didn’t take her to Australia.
“Our bodies hurt from crying, we have no tears left,” said Natali, whose mother was killed on 7 October.
She said they wanted to keep the international focus on the kidnapped children in particular.
“They shouldn’t be suffering because of politics, it has nothing to do with that,” she said.
“We’ll do everything we can to get her back.”
Eylon Keshet also spoke of his cousin Yarden Bibas, his wife Shiri Bibas and their sons Ariel, four, and 10-month-old Kfir, who are feared kidnapped in Gaza.
“Release them. I want them back. But I don’t want any more body bags,” he said.
“It’s important to understand that this is a humanitarian issue – regardless of politics, a 10-month-old baby can’t be used as a bargaining chip for any political or religious reason whatsoever.”
Following his meeting with Emily’s family today, Varadkar said he assured them “that the government will do all in its power” to secure the girl’s release.
“I committed to continue calling for all hostages held by Hamas to be released immediately, and I also committed to continue raising the issue of hostages with international agencies and Governments, and through any other avenues which might help,” he said.

"Paddy Cosgrave courted controversy for years, but the tech world drew the line at criticism of Israel","THIS WEEK’S WEB Summit will be the first to take place without co-founder Paddy Cosgrave as director and CEO.
Cosgrave formally resigned as chief executive office of Web Summit and as director of its parent company Manders Terrace Ltd this month following backlash to statements he made on Twitter accusing Israel of “war crimes” in Gaza.
The 40-year-old entrepreneur has been regarded as a controversial figure since the 2015 Web Summit event, throughout which he raised complaints about infrastructural problems in Dublin, including unsatisfactory Wi-Fi coverage, hotel costs and traffic near the RDS, where it was held. At the time, Cosgrave appeared to engage in a PR tug-of-war with the Irish government, inviting Taoiseach Enda Kenny to the event two days before it began.
The next year, Cosgrave uprooted Web Summit and relocated the annual event to the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, which is where next week’s event will also take place.
In the ensuing years, Cosgrave has become an even more vociferous critic of the Irish government, regularly broadcasting his thoughts to his 92.5k Twitter followers.
There is a sense that Cosgrave had long walked a tightrope – balancing the running of an organisation that relies on the involvement of establishment figures, political leaders and multinational corporations, while using his personal profile to advance an agenda that centred around attacking corruption in Irish public life, and what he has often referred to as “cronyism”.
Crusade against cronyism
The day before the 2020 general election, Cosgrave publicly took a political stand in which he called on the public not to vote for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.
In a tweet that contained language that would come to define Cosgrave’s public persona over the next few years, he said: “Voting FFG tomorrow is a vote for me & my crony pals. Under FFG, my personal tax rate & cronies like me can remain below 2%, my company’s tax rate can remain close to 0%, tax on family offices of my crony pals can remain ~0%.”
The tweet suggested a ratcheting up of Cosgrave’s stance on Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, and heralded a new era of frequent anti-government pronouncements by the erstwhile CEO. During this time Cosgrave, who was educated at the Glenstal Abbey Boarding school in Limerick – where fees are currently €21,704 annually for full-time boarding – would often use the phrase “me and my crony pals,” establishing himself as a figure who would attack Ireland’s corridors of power from the inside.
In 2021 the only people that should still be supporting FFG are cronies like meUnless you own/run a big company or vulture fund or property fund or use Ireland for profit shifting or similar, then FFG don't represent your interestsFFG represent my interests and my crony pals— Paddy Cosgrave (@paddycosgrave)December 31, 2020
In 2021 the only people that should still be supporting FFG are cronies like meUnless you own/run a big company or vulture fund or property fund or use Ireland for profit shifting or similar, then FFG don't represent your interestsFFG represent my interests and my crony pals
The Wicklow man had regularly tweeted about the issue of cronyism in Ireland since 2019. He and his followers regularly used the pirate flag emoji in order to signal their participation in this loose, big tent, anti-cronyism movement.
As recently as July of this year,Cosgrave responded to a tweet by Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins, apparently implying that the “values” and “priorities” of the party amount to “cronyism” – suggesting that his attitude towards Ireland’s ruling parties remains unchanged.
Cosgrave’s criticism of the government intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic, though on one occasion this resulted in a very public climbdown. Less than a month after Ireland’s first record case of Covid-19, Cosgrave caused consternation by tweeting thefalse claim that four HSE nurses had died of Covid.
The tweet was retweeted without comment more than 350 times and ‘liked’ by over 4,000 accounts on the platform, though it later transpired that Cosgrave’s source, businessman Pat Phelan, had been mistaken.
The claim was almost immediately refuted by the HSE, and three months later Cosgraveissued a public apologyto both the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation as well as the HSE.
While Cosgrave got it badly wrong on this occasion, he had established himself as a critic of the Irish healthcare system who mostly dealt in the truth. As reported byThe Journal, Cosgrave had also “tweeted a number of stories from sources which turned out to be true – or, at least, had kernels of truth within”.
His popularity grew significantly during this time as he continued to challenge the Irish government over its Covid respond, and his Twitter following has nearly doubled from the 55,000 he’d amassed as of March 2020.
The Ditch
In April 2021, Irish news website The Ditch was founded with financial backing from Paddy Cosgrave, via Web Summit. Upon its foundation, the website was helmed editorially by Roman Shortall, Chay Bowes and Eoghan McNeill.
The Ditch gathered steam in August 2022, following a series of greatly consequential investigations into undeclared interests by elected representatives in Ireland. In particular, the website broke several stories relating to Fianna FáilTD Robert Troy, who had failed to disclose the ownership of several properties. The reporting eventually resulted in Troy’s resignation as Minister of State.
Troy’s fellow Minister of StateDamien English, a Fine Gael TD, also resigned from his position after The Ditch reported that he’d failed to declare ownership of an existing home in his planning application for a new property in 2008.
There have been changes at the top of The Ditch since its inception, however, most notably the departure of Chay Bowes.
Bowes, a whistleblower who had provided Village Magazine with details pertaining to Leo Varadkar leaking a confidential GP contract agreement to his personal friend Dr Maitiú Ó Tuathail in 2020, stepped back from his role in The Ditch in summer 2022.
Originally a one-third shareholder in the organisation, Bowes divested his holdings at some point before annual returns were filed earlier this year.

Bowes has since become a correspondent for Russia Today, and has been invited by Russia to speak at the UN Security Council, where he condemned what he called the “ever hawkish Anglosphere” for their military support for Ukraine, which he characterised as a “seemingly perpetual escalation of military aid”.

Legal actions
By the time The Ditch had begun to make a stir, Cosgrave had long been embroiled in legal action involving two former cofounders of Web Summit. The messy litigation remains ongoing and mired in the discovery process, wherein each side pores over the evidence that will be presented by the other side.
The legal drama kicked off when Cosgrave sued fellow cofounder David Kelly over an alleged breach of fiduciary duties. Kelly then countersued, claiming that Cosgrave had acted in a way that disadvantaged minority shareholders. Kelly himself owns 12% of Web Summit.
This was quickly followed by another suit filed against Cosgrave, in which fellow cofounder Daire Hickey, who owns 7% of the company, made the same claim. As things stand, further motions pertaining to the suits will proceed in December of this year.
In addition to legal challenges with respect to business dealings, Cosgrave is also facing litigation over his Twitter output.
In November of last year, CEO of Roqu Group Robert Quirke also filed a suit against Cosgrave for defamation over a tweet Cosgrave had published which referred to a dispute between the HSE and Roqu Group over the sourcing of ventilators from China during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The suit has not progressed since then and Cosgrave denies the accusation, maintaining that his statements were the truth.
Resignation
Despite this legacy of contentious events, it was not until Cosgrave spoke up about the unfolding violence in Gaza that his time as leader of Web Summit came to an end.
In respect of the bombing campaign inflicted upon Gaza by Israel, Cosgrave tweeted on 13 October: “I’m shocked at the rhetoric and actions of so many western leaders and governments, with the exception in particular of Ireland’s government, who for once are doing the right thing… War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are.”
Cosgrave went on to apologise for the tweet on 17 October, 10 days after the attack by Hamas which left hundreds of Israelis civilians dead and roughly 240 people kidnapped.
“I understand that what I said, the timing of what I said, and the way it has been presented has caused profound hurt to many,” he said in a statement posted to the Web Summit website.
“To anyone who was hurt by my words, I apologise deeply. What is needed at this time is compassion, and I did not convey that.” He also announced he would be taking a break from Twitter.
It is notable that by the time Cosgrave would resign, some humanitarian organisations like Amnesty International had begun to characterise some of Israel’s actions in Gaza as war crimes.
“Our research points to damning evidence of war crimes in Israel’s bombing campaign that must be urgently investigated,” said Agnes Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty on 20 October, the day before Cosgrave’s resignation.
Nevertheless, it was this tweet that led many of the world’s largest tech companies – including Meta, Google, Stripe, Amazon Web Services and  YCombinator – to pull out of next week’s conference in Lisbon.
My apologyhttps://t.co/8wfXPzGKyT— Paddy Cosgrave (@paddycosgrave)October 17, 2023
My apologyhttps://t.co/8wfXPzGKyT
The apology was not enough to stem the haemorrhaging of participating tech giants, and four days later, Cosgrave resigned from the company he had founded and led from a lecture hall in 2009 to a global phenomenon once described by Politico as “the Olympics of tech”. He was replaced by Katherine Maher, an American who is the former CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit which serves as the hosting platform for Wikipedia.
The latest twist in the tale came on Tuesday night, when Web Summit tweeted a thread announcing that it would be cutting ties with The Ditch. The tech event giant confirmed that part-owner Adam Connon – general counsel at Web Summit – had transferred his shareholding in the Ditch Media Ltd, effectively ending the association between the two organisations – and sending a clear message that the company is reshaping itself in the absence of Cosgrave.
While no explicit connection has been made between the two events, The Ditch had publicly expressed support for Palestine by tweeting an image of a Palestinian flag on 7 October, the same day as the attack by Hamas.
The Ditch had been counting on an influx of €1,000,000 through Web Summit over the next five years, funding which will now need to be sourced elsewhere. In their announcement, the Web Submit said that its “mission is connecting people and ideas that change the world”.
“As Web Summit moves to focus on our core mission, the board has determined we will conclude our funding relationship with the Ditch.”
That same evening, The Ditch’s official Twitter account posted: “…The Ditchhas, upon reflection, decided it would like to apologise to: Nobody” and called Israel a “racist, supremacist, apartheid state”. The Ditch then deleted those tweets, and have yet to issue a statement in the aftermath of Web Summit’s announcement. The Ditch has been contacted byThe Journalfor comment.
Cosgrave has not made a public statement since 21 October, when he resigned as CEO of Web Summit. He has been contacted byThe Journalfor comment.

Gaza hospitals run out of fuel as fighting rages and EU condemns Hamas' use of 'human shields',"
INTENSE FIGHTING IS raging around Gaza’s biggest hospital where doctors said thousands of Palestinians were trapped in dire conditions, as Israel pledged to help evacuate babies from the crippled facility.
Gaza City’s Al-Shifa hospital has been caught in Israel’s ground offensive aimed at destroying Hamas, and the compound has been repeatedly hit by gunfire and strikes, one of which Gaza health officials said destroyed the cardiac ward today.
The Israeli military has denied deliberately targeting the hospital and has repeatedly accused the Islamist militant group ruling Gaza of using medical facilities or tunnels beneath them as command centres and hideouts – a charge Hamas denies.
Fears have intensified for patients and people taking refuge in Al-Shifa hospital and other healthcare facilities in Gaza, and medical aid group Médecins Sans Frontières has warned that without a ceasefire or evacuation a hospital “will become a morgue”.
The conflict broke out after Hamas fighters crossed the militarised border with Israel on 7 October, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 240 people hostage, according to the most recent Israeli figures.
Israel’s relentless campaign in response has killed more than 11,000 people, also mostly civilians and including thousands of children, according to the latest figures from the health ministry in Gaza.
The ministry has not updated tolls for two days citing the collapse of hospital services.
Witnesses inside the Al-Shifa hospital told AFP by phone today that “violent fighting” had raged around the hospital the whole night.
The EU has condemned Hamas, claiming the group uses “hospitals and civilians as human shields” in Gaza, while also urging Israel to show “maximum restraint” to protect civilians from the war it is waging.
“The EU is gravely concerned about the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement.
“These hostilities are severely impacting hospitals and taking a horrific toll on civilians and medical staff,” the EU statement said.
“The EU emphasises that international humanitarian law stipulates that hospitals, medical supplies and civilians inside hospitals must be protected.
“Hospitals must also be supplied immediately with the most urgent medical supplies and patients that require urgent medical care need to be evacuated safely. In this context, we urge Israel to exercise maximum restraint to ensure the protection of civilians.”
“The EU condemns the use of hospitals and civilians as human shields by Hamas,” the statement said.
It reiterated Brussels’ stance that Israel has a “right to defend itself in line with international law and international humanitarian law”.
The EU called for speedy and “unhindered” humanitarian access so aid can reach Gazans suffering under more than a month of bombardment, displacement and extremely limited water, food, fuel and shelter.
It called on Hamas to release the 240 hostages its militants took captive during the 7 October attack on Israeli and said it was “crucial” that the International Committee of the Red Cross be given access to the hostages.
“The EU joins calls for immediate pauses in hostilities and the establishment of humanitarian corridors,” it said.
Bright flares lit up the night sky over Gaza City and blasts echoed across the city, AFP television images showed, as Israel’s air and ground campaign brought the fight to key medical installations.
“If we do not stop this bloodshed immediately with a ceasefire or at the bare minimum a medical evacuation of patients, these hospitals will become a morgue,” medical aid group Médecins Sans Frontières warned this morning.

Al-Shifa hospital is “totally surrounded and bombardments are going on nearby”, said the hospital’s director, Mohammad Abu Salmiya.

“The medical team cannot work and the bodies, in their dozens, cannot be managed or buried,” he said.
Inside the hospital, Médecins Sans Frontières surgeon Mohammed Obeid said there was no water, power, food or internet access for about 600 post-operative patients, 37-40 babies and 17 people in intensive care.
Countless other people are seeking refuge in the hospital grounds.
The surgeon said in an audio message posted yesterday on social media that two babies died in the Al-Shifa neonatal unit after power to their incubators was cut off and a man also died when his ventilator shut down.
Patients are out “in the streets without care” after “forced evacuations” of two paediatric hospitals in Gaza, countering the Israeli army which said it secured safe passage for civilians.
“The forced evacuations of Al-Nasr and Rantisi paediatric hospitals have left sick people on the streets without care” in Gaza City, Mohammed Zaqut, director-general of hospitals in the Palestinian territory, told reporters.
“We have completely lost contact with the caregivers” at these two hospitals, he added.
The UN’s World Health Organisation has expressed alarm at the situation in Al-Shifa.
“WHO is gravely concerned about the safety of health workers, hundreds of sick and injured patients, including babies on life support, and displaced people who remain inside the hospital,” director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, has said there is “no one and nowhere safe in Gaza today”.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Brendan O’Connor programme, he said there are 11 hospitals south of the Wadi Gaza line, where Palestinians have been warned to go for their safety.
“Of them, only three of them can do surgical intervention. They’re already full and full to overflowing. At this point, for the critically injured that could be possibly taken out of the northern part of Gaza, the only option is to take them out of Gaza through the Rafah crossing and into Egypt,” he said.
He said the WHO has no information “that would be convincing” that the Al-Shifa hospital is being used by Hamas.
“The doctors or nurses that are working there are working in a hospital with hundreds of workers, hundreds of patients, babies in incubators, people in intensive care. They’re working to try and save lives,” he said.
“Even in a case where a hospital or health facility is considered to be being used by an opposite force, there still stands under international law, the questions of proportionality and precaution. Even in a situation like that, it is incumbent upon the conflicting forces to be able to demonstrate proportionality.
“In other words, they need to be able to demonstrate that any loss of civilian life is absolutely minimised, that there are no direct attacks on patients or doctors or nurses and that there’s the highest level of precaution taken in that regard.”
The Israeli military pledged yesterday to aid the evacuation of babies from the hospital, noting that “staff of the Al-Shifa hospital has requested that tomorrow”.
Military spokesman Daniel Hagari pledged that “we will help the babies in the paediatric department to get to a safer hospital. We will provide the assistance needed.”
Twenty of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are “no longer functioning”, according to the UN’s humanitarian agency.
Very little aid has made it into Gaza in the five weeks of war, with the densely populated coastal territory effectively sealed off by a total blockade that Israel has vowed to maintain until the hostages are freed.
The Israeli military confirmed that a Jordanian plane dropped medical equipment and food to the Jordanian Hospital in the Gaza Strip.
The army declined to elaborate further, and Israel’s Foreign Ministry also made no comment.
As the fighting raged, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night ruled out a role for the current Palestinian Authority government in Gaza once the war is over.
“There will have to be something else there,” he said, when asked whether the Palestinian Authority (PA), which has partial administrative control in the occupied West Bank, may govern Gaza after the war.

Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, in a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier this month, said the PA could only assume power in Gaza if a “comprehensive political solution” is found for the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict encompassing the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
Netanyahu also rejected further calls for a ceasefire, saying: “The war against (Hamas) is advancing with full force, and it has one goal, to win. There is no alternative to victory.”
In an interview earlier this week, he said that Israel would assume “overall security” over Gaza “for an indefinite period” after the war.
The intense fighting in northern Gaza has accelerated an exodus of people toward Gaza’s south.
In all, the Israeli army said Saturday that in the past three days around 200,000 Palestinians had left southwards from the area of the northern Gaza Strip where fighting is heaviest.

In Gaza’s south, arriving people were no longer able to find tents or improvised shelter, with some sleeping in the streets, according to AFP journalists.
Strikes were also hitting buildings at the southern end of Gaza in Rafah, the area to which civilians have been urged to evacuate.
A strike in southern Bani Souheila destroyed a dozen houses today, killing at least four people and wounded at least 30, said an AFP reporter at the scene.
Almost 1.6 million people have been internally displaced since 7 October, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA. This equals about two-thirds of Gaza’s population.
Around the world, the war has sparked Israeli commemorations for those killed and kidnapped on 7 October, and pro-Palestinian rallies decrying the plight of people in Gaza and demanding a ceasefire.
Police estimated 300,000 marched in London on Sunday to support Palestinians. Many carried placards proclaiming “Stop Bombing Gaza”, “Ceasefire Now” or “Free Palestine”.
The families of Israeli hostages spoke of their agony at a rally in Tel Aviv yesterday.
“I came here to shout for my kidnapped parents,” said Yair Mozes, whose parents were both abducted from Nir Oz, a kibbutz in southern Israel.
“We don’t know their situation and we need them to be released immediately.”
The conflict is stoking regional tensions and fears of the war expanding into neighbouring countries.
Israel fighter jets carried out strikes against “terror infrastructure” targets inside Syria in response to cross-border fire directed at the Golan Heights, the military said on Sunday.
Exchanges of cross-border fire have also taken place regularly along the frontier with Lebanon.
Speaking at a summit of Arab and Muslim leaders in the Saudi capital Riyadh, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called on Islamic governments to designate Israel’s military a “terrorist organisation”.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Saturday warned Iran-backed Hezbollah that launching a war would result in widespread destruction in Lebanon similar to that in Gaza.

Hezbollah attacks wound Israeli troops along Lebanon border,"ATTACKS BY LEBANON’S Hezbollah group have wounded seven Israeli troops and 10 other people, Israel’s military and rescue services said.
The clashes came as skirmishes between the Iran-backed group and Israeli military continue to intensify along the Lebanon-Israel border, threatening to escalate into another front in the Middle East’s latest war.
The Israeli military said in a statement that “seven IDF soldiers were lightly injured as a result of the mortar shell launches in the area of Manara in northern Israel earlier today”.
Israeli rescue services did not identify the location or provide information about the 10 others wounded by rocket blasts and shrapnel, but said two of them were in a critical condition.
The Israeli military said they identified 15 launches from Lebanon over the past hour and their defence systems intercepted four of them. The rest fell into open areas.

Hamas’s military wing, meanwhile, claimed responsibility for shelling the northern Haifa and the Israeli border towns of Na’ura and Shlomi from southern Lebanon without giving any further details.
Hezbollah first fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli community just over the border today, Israeli officials said, badly wounding utility workers.
The Israeli military said it was striking the origin of the launch with artillery fire.
The Israel Electric Corp said workers in the rural community of Dovev were wounded while repairing lines damaged in a previous attack. Israeli media reported that six people were wounded, including one critically.
Israel hit several southern Lebanese towns, including Yaroun, Mays el-Jabal, and Alma al-Shaab.
Hezbollah said it launched guided missiles against a “logistical force belonging to the occupation army that was about to install transmission poles and eavesdropping and spying devices near the Dovev barracks”.

It said it hit an Israeli military bulldozer in a separate strike. Shortly after the attack, air raid sirens were heard in northern Israel. Army Radio reported that another anti-tank missile had been fired from Lebanon.
Hezbollah later announced attacks on Israeli military gatherings and barracks in border areas Birket Riche and Zareit, as clashes continue to intensify along the tense Lebanon-Israel border.
The assault was the most serious incident involving civilians since an Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon on 5 November killed a woman and three children.
Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants and their allies have been clashing along the border since the Israel-Hamas war started five weeks ago with a bloody incursion into southern Israel by Hezbollah ally Hamas.
While largely contained, clashes have increased in intensity as Israel conducts a ground offensive in Gaza against Hamas.
Also today, the United Nations peacekeeping force in south Lebanon, Unifil, said one of its peacekeepers had been wounded by gunfire overnight near the Lebanese town of al-Qawza.
It was not clear where the shooting had come from or whether the peacekeepers were targeted or caught in crossfire. Unifil, which features a contingent of Irish troops, said it was investigating.
The Irish Defence Forces have toldThe Journalthat all Irish members of the UNIFIL force are safe and accounted for.
A Defence Forces spokesperson said:
“On several occasions since commencement of hostilities UNIFIL, and specifically IRISHPOLBATT have been subject to GROUNDHOG (taking shelter in protected positions).
“The Irish troops of the 122nd Infantry Battalion in UNIFIL continue to monitor the situation and to conduct planned framework operations.
“All Irish and Maltese soldiers are accounted for and are safe.
“The deployment of the 123rdInfantry Battalion to UNIFIL is continuing as planned.”

 What Israel is doing in Gaza is beyond horrific - we cannot stand idly by","THE CARNAGE IN Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe and the moral authority of Western nations has been exposed as a sham.
As I write, the death toll in Gaza has exceeded 11,000. By the time you read this, it will likely be much higher. Among this number are more than 5,000 children who have died excruciating deaths – they have been incinerated by Israeli missiles, crushed by falling debris or buried alive under mountains of rubble.
In the first three weeks of this conflict, the number of children killed in Israel’s assault on Gaza had surpassed the annual number of children killed in global conflict zones every year since 2019. Gaza is now a graveyard for children, with an average of 160 children killed every day.
For those who survive, life in Gaza is a living hell. Israel has dropped more than 25,000 tonnes of explosives on an area half the size of Louth in just over a month. More bombs were dropped on Gaza in the first two weeks of this conflict than were dropped on Afghanistan in an entire year.
According to Médecins Sans Frontières, the healthcare system in Gaza has collapsed and children are enduring operations like amputations without anaesthetic. Every day, 180 women give birth, 15% of whom will experience complications and need medical care that is currently unavailable.
Supplies of food, water, medical supplies and fuel to Gaza remain cut off, with Israeli authorities only allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid to enter. Emaciated women cannot produce milk to feed their babies; one million children lack access to clean water and food supplies are at critical lows.
UN schools, hospitals, media centres, bakeries and residential buildings have all been deliberately targeted by Israeli missiles. The entire Strip is being reduced to death and dust.

I unequivocally condemn the barbaric attack by Hamas on Israel on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and at least 243 people were kidnapped. Taking hostages is a war crime and every hostage must be released.
I understand, and empathise with, the rage, grief and fear of the Israeli people. The appalling attack by Hamas triggered generational trauma that is raw and real. Israel unquestionably has a right to defend itself.
What Israel is doing is not a defence. It is an annihilation – laying waste to Gaza almost in its entirety, decimating civilian infrastructure and killing civilians with impunity.
Despite this, much of the Western world can’t even muster up a single word of criticism for the Israeli government. These are countries that claim to respect international law and value human rights. They just don’t appear to view the Palestinians as being deserving of those rights or protections.
Ireland has been almost alone in even demanding a ceasefire. In the UK, even the leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer, has refused to consider a ceasefire. The moral authority of Western leaders lies in tatters, buried under the rubble in Gaza.
What is happening in Gaza is not a war,it is an ethnic cleansing. The violence is not just confined to Gaza. Since 7 October, attacks by Israeli settlers in theWest Bankon Palestinians, which were already at record highs, have increased exponentially.
In the past month, at least 178 Palestinians, including 45 children, have been killed by Israeli settlers and soldiers in the West Bank – an area where Hamas has no presence. At least 1,000 Palestinians have been displaced, including 424 children, and more than 2,000 people have been detained. The number of Palestinians held in administrative detention – a euphemism for internment – increased from 1,319 on October 1 to 2,070 on November 1.
For too long, the Palestinian people have been driven from their land, corralled and confined into open air prisons. Forced to exist under an apartheid regime that has inflicted injustice after injustice on innocent people. This is a regime that has continuously massacred civilians – the escalation of violence in Gaza has just reached an unprecedented level.
Ireland may be a small country, but we must use whatever influence we have to stop this carnage. Next week, the Dáil will debate a Social Democrats’ motion that calls on the government to do more than just condemn Israeli atrocities – it demands actions to accompany those words.

The Taoiseach has previously stated he believes multilateral economic sanctions are the most effective. As a member of the EU, we have an opportunity to advocate for exactly that.
Trade between the EU and Israel is governed by theEU-Israel Association Agreement, a legal contract that has an ‘essential elements’ human rights clause. This means that respect for human rights is supposed to form the bedrock of the deal, and a breach of those rights is sufficient for either side to unilaterally suspend the trade deal. If the destruction in Gaza is not sufficient to trigger this clause, nothing ever will.
There are other economic sanctions that can be applied. Israel is currently a party toHorizon Europe, a €95 billion EU fund for research and innovation. Access to this lucrative funding stream should also be suspended.
There are measures we can take in this country too. The refusal of the Israeli government to stop the deliberate targeting of civilians, journalists, UN staff and healthcare workers means the diplomatic status of the Israeli ambassador should be withdrawn. The Occupied Territories Bill and the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill 2023 – which penalise economic activity in the Occupied Territories – should immediately be enacted.
The death and destruction in Gaza must stop. If Israel won’t end its slaughter, then it must face consequences like economic sanctions. This is the bare minimum the international community could, and should, do.
Ultimately, we are hoping for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. There will not be a military solution to this conflict, there can only be a political solution.
The Irish government should also pursue all possible avenues at the EU and the UN to build an international alliance for peace to provide a pathway away from violence and back to the negotiating table. The prospect of a lasting peace, and justice, must be kept alive.

'We’ll work hard to win your trust': McDonald says she wants to form a Govt without FF and FG,"MARY LOU MCDONALD has said Sinn Féin will “work hard” to win the trust of voters, telling the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis this evening that she wants to form a government “without Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil”.
Addressing the 1,000 delegates gathered in the Technological University of Shannon Campus in Athlone, Westmeath, McDonald also used her speech to call out the action of Israel in recent weeks as “war crimes”.
The Sinn Féin leader also called on the government to “send the Israeli ambassador home” in 0ff-script remarks in her closing speech.
In her address to delegates, McDonald also outlined how housing is her party’s number one priority.
“The stark choice at the next election is between a worsening housing crisis under this government or a new government, led by Sinn Féin that will fix housing, once and for all. I’m asking everyone watching tonight to back Sinn Féin’s ambitious vision for housing,” she said.
McDonald said her party wants to lead an Ireland where “orange and green” is reconciled and where there is “no place for racism, Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or sectarianism”.
Appealing to viewers of the televised address, the Sinn Féin leader said:
“A new government without Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil for the first time in a hundred years. Just imagine that.
“That would be the very best outcome from the General Election. Of course, the people will make that call. It’s your decision. We take nothing for granted. There are no inevitabilities.
“We’ll work hard to win your trust, your support, and your vote to elect enough Sinn Féin TDs to form a government for change,” she said.
“We ask for our chance. The others have had theirs. The longer they remain in power the worse things get. I’m asking you to back Sinn Féin. To back change and the future that you and your family deserve,” said McDonald.
Turning to the Israel-Hamas conflict, she welcomed the Palestinian ambassador to Ireland Jilan Abdalmajidwho had addressed the Ard Fheis earlier in the day.
“Israel claims to act in self-defence. Carpet bombing civilians, Collective punishment, massacring children in their thousands is not defence.

“These are not justifiable responses to the horrific attack by Hamas’ on October 7th. The world sees Israeli actions for what they are.
“Barbaric. Hateful. Cowardly. War crimes,” said McDonald.
She said now is “moment of reckoning for world leaders, for the European Union, a test of commitment to human rights, peace, democracy”.
McDonald said Israel cannot be allowed to commit atrocities with impunity, and called on the government to support her party’s motion next week to refer Israel to the International Criminal Court.
There was a standing ovation and applause from the crowd when McDonald called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador to Ireland, stating: “send her home”.
On the issue of housing, she said it is the priority issue, adding that government claims their housing plan is working.
“If this is success, may we never see their failures. They say housing can’t be fixed overnight. They’ve had over a decade. Their record – crisis,” she said.
“We need a new government to bring energy, pace, and the plan to fix housing. Sinn Féin will build genuinely affordable homes, build enough of them, get the targets right, increase capital expenditure.
“Cut rents, giving a month’s rent back to every renter, and ban rent increases for three years. Implement a real emergency response to the scourge of homelessness,” said McDonald.
Making a number of party pledges, she said Sinn Fein will resolve the housing crisis, resource healthcare, provide affordable childcare, invest in higher education, and deliver infrastructure on budget and on time.
McDonald also committed to nurturing Ireland’s flair for enterprise to deliver decent well-paid and secure jobs.
“The right to retire on your pension at sixty-five. That’s what we’re about,” she added.
“We will house our people. We will make healthcare accessible to all. We will win the race against climate change. And friends, in our time, we will unite our country and build a nation home for everyone.
This is the momentous task before us. Let’s make change happen now. Let’s make change happen for everyone,” she concluded.

Gaza health ministry says premature babies at risk as main hospital under constant fire and running out of fuel,"LAST UPDATE|11 Nov 2023

GAZA HOSPITALS HAVE said they are under constant fire and running on nearly exhausted supplies today as Israel rejected key allies’ condemnation of a rising civilian death toll in the Hamas-controlled territory.
The director of the besieged Palestinian territory’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, said the compound was struck repeatedly overnight and lost power for hours after its generator was hit.
“We received calls about dozens of dead and hundreds wounded in air and artillery strikes, but our ambulances weren’t able to go out because of gunfire,” said hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiya.
Israel has denied targeting hospitals and its army has accused Hamas of using the medical facilities as command centres and hideouts, a charge the Palestinian militant group denies.
The Gaza health ministry said dozens of premature babies at Al-Shifa compound were at risk of dying because the lack of generator fuel meant their incubators could be shut down today as fighting raged.
They added one of the babies had died, and one person was killed and several others wounded in a strike on Al-Shifa early today.
In a statement, aid agency Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said it was “extremely concerned” about the safety of patients and medical staff at Al-Shifa hospital, adding that the situation in the hospital was “catastrophic”.
“The hostilities around the hospital have not stopped. MSF teams and hundreds of patients are still inside Al-Shifa hospital,” the statement read, reiterating its call ”to stop the attacks against hospitals, for an immediate ceasefire and for the protection of medical facilities, medical staff and patients.”
“We are being killed here, please do something” texted one of MSF nurse from Al-Shifa hospital basement this morning, where he and his family were sheltering from the incessant bombing.

In the Shifa hospital courtyard, the boom of explosions echoed around Mohammed Rihane as he walked on crutches for his injured leg.
“People are dying, torn to shreds in the streets and we can’t go and look for them,” he said. Moving around the city remains incredibly dangerous.
The suffering in Gaza has prompted growing calls for a halt in five weeks of fighting in order to protect civilian lives and allow humanitarian aid into the densely populated territory.
French President Emmanuel Macron called on Israel to stop bombing civilians in Gaza, saying there was “no justification” and the deaths were causing “resentment”.
In an interview with the BBC broadcast yesterday, Macron said Israel had the right to protect itself after the Hamas attacks, but he said that civilians were dying as a result of the country’s air and expanding ground campaign.
“These babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed,” the French leader said. “So there is no reason for that and no legitimacy. So we do urge Israel to stop.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back, saying the responsibility for any harm to civilians lies with Hamas.
“Israel does everything in its power to avoid harming civilians and urges them to leave the battle areas,” he said.
Arab and Muslim leaders today said they rejected any proposal that would keep Gaza separate from the West Bank in a future Palestinian state.
The final statement from a summit in the Saudi capital stressed the importance of “the unity of Gaza and the West Bank as the territory of the Palestinian State”, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Saudi Arabia denounced what it described as “double standards” in the world’s response to the Israel-Hamas war, saying Israel was getting a pass on violations of international law.
“We are watching and observing the double standards and we are reassessing based on this the credibility of international systems. If there is no commitment binding everyone to these foundations, it is difficult to speak of these foundations as unifying foundations,” Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told a press conference following a summit in the capital Riyadh.
Hamas fighters smashed through the militarised border on 7 October, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 240 people hostage, according to the most recent Israeli figures.
The Gaza health ministry says Israeli fighting has killed more than 11,000 people, also mostly civilians and thousands of them children.
Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian armed group present in Gaza, said today its “fighters are engaged in fierce clashes in the vicinity of Al-Shifa hospital complex” and other areas of Gaza City, claiming to have caused “casualties in the ranks of the (Israeli) enemy forces”.

Many people have taken refuge in the hospital grounds. AFP journalists saw people in beds lined up along a corridor. Some cooked meals with gas cannister stoves and ate while sitting on the floor.
Concern over the civilian toll has also come from staunch Israel ally Washington, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying Friday: “Far too many Palestinians have been killed.”
The conflict has stoked regional tensions, with deadly cross-border exchanges between the Israeli army and Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement.
Speaking at a summit of Arab and Muslim leaders in the Saudi capital Riyadh, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called on Islamic governments to designate Israel’s military a “terrorist organisation”.
He also urged nations that have ties with Israel to sever them and called for greater support for Palestinians.
Iran backs Hamas as well as Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Huthi rebels, placing it at the centre of concerns the war could expand.
In northern Gaza, the director of the Indonesian hospital said lack of fuel forced the facility to cut power to things like their desalination plant, scanners and lifts.
“The hospital is working with 30-40% of its capacity,” Atef Al-Kahlot said.

“We call on the honourable people of the world, if any of them are left, to put pressure on the occupation forces to supply the Indonesian hospital and the rest of the hospitals in the Gaza Strip.”
Hospitals have become key sites for Palestinians seeking refuge from the intense gun battles and bombardment.
A wounded boy at the Indonesian hospital, Youssef Al-Najjar, said he was waiting for surgery but the necessary machines were off due to lack of power.
“I’m very thirsty but I’m not allowed to drink or eat until the operation is done,” he added.
Twenty of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are “no longer functioning”, the UN’s humanitarian agency said.
Fighting has reduced some streets in Gaza to ruins, with the sounds of apparent explosions and gunfire caught today on AFPTV’s Gaza City camera.
The bodies of about 50 people killed in a strike on Gaza City’s Al-Buraq school were taken to the Al-Shifa hospital, its director said Friday.
Israel today said its forces launched a air strike on the school that killed a Hamas company commander saying the group uses civilians as “human shields” — a charge it denies.

The exodus toward Gaza’s south, which has accelerated under intense fighting and through evacuation corridors, has seen tens of thousands of people flee in recent days.
An estimated 30,000 additional Palestinians went southwards through a corridor opened by the Israeli military on Friday, according to the UN humanitarian affairs office OCHA.
The Israeli military said that around 150,000 Palestinians have left in a “mass evacuation” south in recent days from the area of the northern Gaza Strip where combat is heavy.
However, strikes were hitting buildings at the southern end of Gaza in Rafah, the area of the densely-populated territory to which civilians have been urged to evacuate.
“They struck us with a missile, and they are innocent people,” said Harb Fojou, standing near the rubble of a destroyed building.
Almost 1.6 million people have been internally displaced since 7 October, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA – about two thirds of Gaza’s population.

SF crowd chants 'free Palestine' as ambassador to Ireland receives rapturous applause at Ard Fheis,"LAST UPDATE|11 Nov 2023
THE PALESTINIAN AMBASSADOR to Ireland received a rapturous applause at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis this afternoon, where she was embraced by former party leader Gerry Adams.
Palestine’s ambassador to Ireland Jilan Abdalmajid told the crowd that Gaza is “hell on earth”, and thanked people for their support for the Palestinian people.
“Israel doesn’t spare any living person or object in Gaza,” she said. “This is beyond rage and revenge. Now, there is no safe space in Gaza.”
“A political solution can be found,” said the ambassador, but only one that results in the Palestinian people being able to live with “peace and security in our land”.
The ambassador received a standing ovation from attendees, with the crowd also chanting: “Free Free Palestine.”

In an interview withThe Journal, the ambassador said she has sent a message back to the Palestinian Authority to seek their help to free the Israeli-Irish hostage Emily Hand – the eight-year-old girl’s father Thomas is originally from Dublin. She is also working back channels to attempt to get 40 Irish citizens out of Gaza via the Egyptian border.

There was also a loud applause from delegates today when Sinn Féin’s Matt Carty said his party will table a motion calling for Israel to be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) over the actions it has taken in Gaza.
Carty also stated that the hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October must be released.
Speaking to reporters at the party’s Ard Fheis in Athlone today, the Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald called on the government to support the motion.
She also repeated a call for the Israeli ambassador to Ireland to be expelled.

She confirmed that her party will support the Social Democrats motion on the matter next week.
McDonald said there is a growing view right across Irish politics and society that the issue of sanctions and consequences for Israel has to be addressed.
Noting the comments made by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar this week that breaches of international law cannot be inconsequential, McDonald said the next move should be a referral to the International Criminal Court.
She said that referral is something that “Irish government can come behind”.
“They’ve made their position on the ambassador clear, I disagree with them, but they have set out their stall on that. Therefore, we will bring the motion to the Dáil next week that seeks a referral by the Irish government, by the Irish state, to the International Criminal Court. And I see no reason why the Irish government would not come behind that motion,” she said.
The office of the prosecutor of the ICC said on Tuesday its mandate applies to the current conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
Reuters reportsthe prosecutor’s office has said the ICC has had an ongoing investigation into “the situation in the State of Palestine” for alleged war crimes committed since 13 June 2014.
“This mandate is ongoing and applies to crimes committed in the current context,” the prosecutors said.
McDonald today repeated a call for a ceasefire in the conflict as she said:
“Clearly when the ambassador’s government despite the calling from parliaments – but more important from the United Nations – refuses to countenance a ceasefire and peace, and when that government relentlessly bombards a civilian population which has resulted in thousands of deaths, many thousands of children’s lives taken, attacks on UN properties and personnel, on journalists.
“In those circumstances, you’re absolutely bound to examine every lever that you you have at your disposal to put pressure on that policy and put pressure on that government.
“It’s not simply to expel and ambassador for the sake of it, this is all about ceasefire”.
She added that she wanted to be “absolutely clear” that the hostages taken by Hamas must be released.
“I think is is really, really alarming and really dangerous that the Netanyahu government has repeatedly refused to agree to a ceasefire,” she said.
McDonald said the Palestinian ambassador is due to address the event.

The Explainer: Israel and Gaza - what are the big questions that need to be answered?,"WE’RE NOW A month into a violent conflict between Israel and Hamas, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of civilians and sparking a dire humanitarian crisis.
Calls for a lasting ceasefire are struggling to get off the ground, and the UN chief António Guterres has now dubbed Gaza a ‘graveyard for children’ as tens of thousands struggle without food, medical care and basic provisions.
This current spate of fighting is just one in a long, long history of tension between Israel and Palestine, dating right back to the partition of the country in the 1940s.
So how did we get here?
This week onThe Explainer, we’re joined by our Assistant News Editor Stephen McDermott to give you a clear overview of the basics of what we’re seeing today – from who Hamas are to how Israel came to be a state.

"Tom Clonan 
 Gaza City could be utterly destroyed as a result of Israel's attacks","LAST UPDATE|10 Nov 2023
THE ISRAELI DEFENCE Forces (IDF) have saturated Gaza city with air strikes and artillery barrages for over a month since 7 October when Hamas launched its homicidal terror attacks on Israel. To date, almost 11,000 Palestinian men, women and children have been slaughtered in Israel’s military response to Hamas’ incursion into Israel and their ongoing missile attacks on civilian targets across southern Israel.
Over 4,000 Palestinian children have been murdered by the IDF since they began their operations in Gaza. I use the word ‘murdered’ deliberately. These children have not ‘died’ or simply been ‘killed’ in the fighting. These passive terms do not capture the fact that these children have been deliberately murdered as a consequence ofwar crimescommitted by the Israeli military.
Israel has a right to defend itself from attacks by Hamas. Israel is a legitimate state with an absolute right to exist. It does not however have the right to commit war crimes in its response to Hamas. The Geneva Conventions and the laws of armed conflict are very explicit in the onus placed on parties to a conflict to protect civilians. Article 51 ‘Protection of the Civilian Population’ sets out the responsibilities of the IDF – and Hamas – toward the 2.2 million innocent civilians trapped in Gaza.
Sections 4 and 5 of Article 51 prohibit the use of weapon systems or a ‘method of attack’ that cannot be directed at or limited to a specific military objective, or where there is a ‘concentration of civilians or civilian objects’. The use of airstrikes and artillery fires on residential districts, refugee camps, hospitals and ambulances are war crimes. The IDF have deliberately targeted civilians in this manner – including thousands of children – and these actions, in my view, meet the threshold of mass murder.
To be clear, even in the event of the possibility of ‘accidental’ ‘collateral damage’ or unintentional civilian casualties, where an attack ‘could cause incidental loss of civilian life or damage to civilian objects, then the attack must be called off’.
There it is, in black and white. There must be an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza to protect the civilian population. President Biden has stated that there is no chance of such a ceasefire.Both the IDF and Hamascontinue to commit war crimes. The principal victims of this criminal activity are innocent Palestinian men, women and children.

Hamas is in direct contravention of Article 51 of the Geneva Conventions. Their genocidal and indiscriminate murder of Israeli civilians is compounded by the despicable act of hostage taking – 240 persons, including it is believed, an Irish Israeli girl, Emily Hand. Hamas is also using – contrary to the laws of armed conflict – Palestinians as de-facto human shields and are operating in the proximity and environs of protected civilian structures. Whilst this is the case, this does not remove the protected status of civilian objects. Israel’sattacks on the al-Shifa hospital, on theal-Rantisi pediatric hospitaland the al-Nasr children’s hospital are despicable war crimes and wholly unjustifiable.
The next stage in the war in Gaza will be particularly brutal and problematic. The IDF has bisected the Gaza Strip and has surrounded Gaza City in the northern sector. In what are termed ‘MOUT’, or ‘Military Operations in Urban Terrain’, the strategy and tactics that will now be used by the IDF will lead to the complete destruction of the city.
Benjamin Netanyahu’s senior spokesperson Mark Regev has stated that the concept of operations for Israel’s stated aim of ‘destroying Hamas’ will resemble the destruction of Islamic State in Raqqa, Syria and Mosul in Iraq. To this end, IDF units are now advancing, street by street, house by house toward the centre of Gaza City – on three axes of advance. They have deployed hundreds of Merkava main battle tanks (MBTs) to this end. They have also deployed their much-vaunted newly developed ‘Namer’ armoured personnel carrier (APC).
The main armament of the Merkava tank is a 120mm cannon that fires high explosive armour-piercing and anti-personnel rounds. There is no cover from such weapon systems in conventional homes, apartments and cellars. Nor is there protection from 12.7 mm heavy machine guns mounted on the Namer APCs and the IDF armoured fighting vehicles (IFVs) deployed in support of those tanks. Firing at a rate of up to 550 rounds per minute, such weapons fire a mix of armoured piercing, conventional and incendiary rounds – capable of penetrating up to 20mm of armoured plate.
Deploying such weapon systems in the civilian environment will have predictable and foreseeable outcomes for Palestinian men, women and children trapped in this environment. Irish troops – myself included – on peacekeeping missions in Lebanon and elsewhere have witnessed at first hand the impact of these weapons on civilians. Horrific soft tissue injuries, burns, limb separation, decapitation along with the shattering of bones and pulping of internal organs. Medical personnel operating with Medicine Sans Frontieres, the Red Crescent in Gaza, have reported such injuries among civilians – and particularly among children. They have also reported injuries arising from flechette rounds and the use ofWhite Phosphorousin the direct fire role.
As the IDF tries to gain ground in Gaza City in the coming days and weeks, images of such injuries will be uploaded in real time, hour by hour, day by day and will likely lead to a wider, regional escalation of the war. Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahain has stated that ‘due to the extension of the war against Gaza’s civilian residents, expansion of the scope of the war has become inevitable’.
Israel’s stated aim to ‘destroy’ Hamas in the manner used to eliminate and disperse Islamic State will come at a very high cost to their own personnel. Their new Namer APCs are not as invulnerable as they had previously thought. One was destroyed on Tuesday of this week with the death of 9 IDF soldiers. Over two dozen Israeli soldiers have been killed in the insertion phase of their invasion. Over 260 have been seriously wounded.
Ultimately – despite their technological superiority and AI-assisted weapon systems – Israeli soldiers will have to dismount from their vehicles and fight face to face with Hamas. Hamas, like Islamic State, has a suicide propensity and will inflict a level of casualties that the IDF and the Israeli public will begin to question.

Lessons learned by the US-led coalition in Syria and Iraq have demonstrated that such operations require a much greater attacker to defender ratio. In conventional operations, this is normally a 3:1 ratio. In the urban environment, it rises to 8:1, which will involve tens of thousands of IDF troops required on the front line. Ammunition expenditure in this environment is also prohibitive at four times the conventional amount of joint direct attack munitions (JDAMs) and precision guided munitions expended 24/7.
The war in Ukraine has already depleted the United States and NATO’s strategic stockpile of such weapons. Whilst Israel has its own domestic weapons industry, it relies on Western suppliers for much of its high-end ordnance.
Russia’s principal ally in that war – Iran – is also watching the war in Gaza closely. If they instruct Hezbollah in Lebanon to open up a missile and ground campaign against northern Israel – the IDF will struggle to contain both fronts.
What is happening in Gaza is an obscenity. In scale and impact, Israel’s assault is defined in international law as ‘disproportionate’, involving collective punishment, ‘wanton destruction’ and ‘wilful killing’. Hamas is also committing war crimes and bears responsibility for these crimes. Criticising Hamas war crimes is not Islamaphobia. Criticising Israeli war crimes is not anti-Semitism. As our Taoiseach and Tánaiste have repeatedly stated, there needs to be an immediate ceasefire and end to the violence. With Irish troops in Lebanon and Syria, Ireland must use her independent, neutral voice – to call for an end to the killing of children and the avoidance of a catastrophic regional war.

Motion to be brought before Dáil on withdrawing diplomatic status of Israeli Ambassador,"TWO MOTIONS ARE to be brought before the Dáil next week regarding Israel.
The Social Democrats will bring a motion forward on Wednesday calling on the Government to withdraw diplomatic status from the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich and push for the imposition of EU-wide economic sanctions on Israel.
In the Dáilon Wednesday, there were fresh calls for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to expel the Israeli ambassador to Ireland.
Varadkar insisted suspending the diplomatic credentials of the Israeli ambassador would hinder Ireland’s attempts to secure the release of eight-year-old Irish-Israeli girl Emily Hand, believed to be held hostage by Hamas, and secure the safe passage of other Irish citizens from Gaza.
In a statement today, Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns said: “Our motion calls on the Irish Government to lobby for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the grounds that the human rights clause in the trade deal has been seriously breached.
“The EU should also suspend Israel’s access to the €95 billion Horizon Europe fund for research and innovation.
“Given Israel’s failure to cease the deliberate targeting of civilians, journalists, UN staff and healthcare workers, the Government must withdraw the diplomatic status of the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland.”
The vote on the motion is expected to take place on Wednesday. It is not yet known if government will seek to amend the motion by introducing its own countermotion.

International Criminal Court
Sinn Féin will bring a motion forward which will call on the Government to refer to the Israeli attacks in Gaza to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for investigation.
On Wednesday, Varadkar said it was the Government’s understanding that a referral was not necessary for an investigation to begin as the ICC has jurisdiction over what goes on in Gaza, but that he would look into the matter and confirm that position.
Ireland has made such a referral recently, in March 2022, when it joined 37 other countries in referring a case against Russia to the court.
A referral would expedite the process of opening a case as it would let the court’s prosecutor proceed without needing the approval of ICC judges.
G7 ministerson Wednesdaycalled for Israel to defend itself “in accordance with international law”, while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar recently said that some of Israel’s actions in Gaza were“something more approaching revenge”.
On Thursday, Varadkar also said that there is an “insistence that humanitarian law should be observed.”
“Failure to do so can’t be inconsequential forever,” said Varadkar. “Double standards will lead to no standards if not checked.”
When asked about Varadkar’s comments at a screening of Hamas attacks at the Israeli Embassy in Dublin on Tuesday, Israeli ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich insisted to reporters thatIsrael’s actions in Gaza are in line with international law.
In a statement today, Sinn Féin spokesperson on Foreign Affairs Matt Carthy welcomed Varadkar’s remarks that failure of Israel to observe humanitarian law can’t be inconsequential.

“The first consequence should be the reiteration of our demand for immediate ceasefires, for the immediate release of all hostages, and for the unconditional adherence by all parties to their commitments under international law and the UN charter,” Carthy said.
“Ireland should also exercise our right as a state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to refer the actions in Palestine and Israel to the Prosecutor of the court for the purpose of requesting an investigation into any acts of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide that have occurred in Gaza over the past month,” he said.
“Sinn Féin will bring a resolution to the Dáil next week mandating the Irish government to make such a referral.”
People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett also welcomed the move from the Social Democrats and commended his oppositional colleagues.
Barrett said: “It is now critical we put unbearable pressure on this government to support these calls, expel the ambassador, impose sanctions, and refer Israel to the ICC for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.”
“I urge people to come in their thousands and tens of thousands to the Dáil this Wednesday at 6pm before the vote takes place to force the government finally take concrete steps to pressure Israel to stop this murderous slaughter.”
His party also commended the Social Democrats for bringing the motion forward and using the time in its private member’s meetings to discuss the topic.

"Israel rules out ceasefire as Gaza health officials say over 11,000 now killed in conflict","LAST UPDATE|10 Nov 2023

PALESTINIANS HAVE SAID a deadly strike today hit Gaza’s largest hospital compound as medical facilities sheltering tens of thousands were caught in intense combat between Israel and Hamas.
Officials in Gaza have reported a death toll of 13 and the director of Gaza City’s Al-Shifa hospital blamed Israeli forces for the strike. Israel did not immediately comment.
Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiya reported two people were killed and 10 wounded in a strike that he said hit the compound’s maternity ward.
A statement from officials in Gaza added that dozens were wounded in an Israeli strike on the hospital compound, giving a toll AFP was not immediately able to independently verify.
Yesterday, Israel reported heavy fighting near the hospital, saying it had killed dozens of militants and destroyed tunnels that are key to Hamas’s capacity to fight.
“There is no safe place left. The army hit Al-Shifa. I don’t know what to do,” said 32-year-old Abu Mohammad, who was among those seeking refuge at the hospital. “There is shooting… at the hospital. We are afraid to go out.”
The Israeli army has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals, particularly Al-Shifa, to coordinate their attacks against the army and also as hideouts for its commanders. Hamas authorities deny the accusations.
Today, the Israeli military has said that it will kill Hamas militants if they are seen firing from hospitals in the Gaza strip.
“If we see Hamas terrorists firing from hospitals, we’ll do what we need to do… If we see Hamas terrorists we’ll kill them,” military spokesman Richard Hecht told reporters.
“Hamas are operating from within the hospital,” Hecht claimed.
Hamas is an Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and the EU, among other powers. It has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 after winning the 2006 Palestinian elections and taking power by force.
Israel launched an offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters poured across the militarised border on 7 October, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 240 hostages.
Vowing to destroy the militants, Israel retaliated with bombardment and a ground campaign that the health ministry says has killed more than 11,000 people - Hamas says it tallies these figures from hospital directors, and they are generally used by international news outlets despite an inability to independently verify them because foreign media and observers have been unable to access the Gaza Strip since the conflict began.
Witnesses told AFP that hundreds of people sheltering at Gaza City’s Al-Rantisi hospital fled on instruction from the Israeli military, which was surrounding it with armoured vehicles.

AFPTV footage showed a fireball and smoke rising over the city at dawn. Early today, sounds of apparent gunfire and explosions could be heard.
As the fighting raged in Gaza, air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv, while Hamas’s military wing said it targeted the Israeli commercial hub with rockets. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
The Red Cross called today for medical facilities and workers in war-ravaged Gaza to be protected, warning the health system there had “reached a point of no return”.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that its teams in recent days had distributed critical supplies to medical structures across Gaza, and had seen “horrendous images that have now gotten worse due to sharpened hostilities”.
This was severely affecting hospitals and ambulances, and taking a heavy toll on civilians, patients and medical staff, it said in a statement.
“Overstretched, running on thin supplies and increasingly unsafe, the healthcare system in Gaza has reached a point of no return.”
Medical facilities and personnel across Gaza have repeatedly come under attack since Israel’s war with Hamas erupted just over a month ago.
Such attacks have dealt “a heavy blow to the healthcare system in Gaza, which is severely weakened after more than one month of heavy fighting,” ICRC said.
The United Nations called for an end to the “carnage” in Gaza, saying “razing entire neighbourhoods to the ground is not an answer for the egregious crimes committed by Hamas”.
“To the contrary, it is creating a new generation of aggrieved Palestinians who are likely to continue the cycle of violence. The carnage simply must stop,” Philippe Lazzarini, head of the United Nations’ agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, wrote in an opinion piece.
The war in the densely populated coastal territory, which is effectively sealed off, has prompted repeated calls for a ceasefire to protect civilian lives and allow in more humanitarian aid.

Tens of thousands of people have fled to the south of the territory in recent days, often on foot and with only the things the could carry.
“Enough destruction, there’s nothing left. We need a truce to see what will later happen to us, a truce to bring medicine or aid to the hospitals,” said Mohammed Khader, who was displaced in Rafah.
“Those hospitals are now full of displaced people and not only injured and martyrs,” he added.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected halting the fighting, telling Fox News yesterday that a “ceasefire with Hamas means surrender to Hamas, surrender to terror”.

He also said Israel does not “seek to govern Gaza” in the long run.
“We don’t seek to occupy it, but we seek to give it and us a better future,” he told the US broadcaster.
Almost 1.6 million people have been internally displaced since 7 October, UNRWA said, more than half Gaza’s population.
But the UN estimates hundreds of thousands of civilians remain in the fiercest battle zones in the north.
Complicating Israel’s military push is the fate of the hostages abducted on 7 October.
CIA director Bill Burns and David Barnea, head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, were in Doha for talks on pauses that would include hostage releases and more aid for Gaza, an official told AFP yesterday.
Four hostages have been freed so far by Hamas and another released in an Israeli operation, and the desperate relatives of those still held in Gaza have piled pressure on Israeli and US authorities to secure the release of their loved ones.
The conflict has also stoked regional tensions, with cross-border exchanges between the Israeli army and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, and Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels saying they launched “ballistic missiles” at southern Israel.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said the expansion of the Israel-Hamas war has become “inevitable”.
The Islamic republic, which supports Hamas financially and militarily, has hailed the militant group’s attack on Israel as a “success” but denied any involvement.
Saudi Arabia is hosting Arab leaders and Iran’s president for two summits this weekend for emergency meetings of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
The world’s biggest oil exporter and its neighbours are “united in fearing one thing in particular, which is a broader escalation”, said Elham Fakhro of Chatham House.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrapped up a marathon diplomatic push today in India after a whirlwind Middle East trip and G7 talks, saying Israel’s pauses in its Gaza offensive would “save lives” but more was needed.
“Far too many Palestinians have been killed,” Blinken said in New Delhi, his last stop before heading home, where he repeated US support for ally Israel but was firm that more aid had to reach civilians in Gaza.

"Bobby McDonagh on Israel/Gaza 
 'Peace requires both sides to accept that they can never win'","LAST UPDATE|10 Nov 2023
I ONCE ASKED Martin McGuinness what had made the peace process possible. He mentioned two factors.
First, he said, the IRA had been reading the doctorates being written by British army officers at UK universities which were all reaching the conclusion that a British military victory was not possible. The IRA, he said, was likewise obliged to look at the reality of the conflict and it came to the same conclusion about its own campaign. Second, given that victory for neither side was possible, there was an awareness that, without a peace agreement, at least another generation in Northern Ireland would be condemned to suffer.
While there are very limited parallels between the IRA and the Palestinian struggle, watching the horror unfolding in Israel last month and now in Gaza has reminded me of both of the factors mentioned by McGuinness.
His first comment concerned power. Both sides of the conflict in Northern Ireland had come, belatedly, to understand their own inability to emerge militarily triumphant. This perception, alas, is absent from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Peace requires an understanding by both parties to any conflict of the limits of their power and of the impossibility of total victory.
Israel understandably feels that it is under an existential threat. However, it also seems to have believed for many decades, especially under Prime Minister Netanyahu, that its overwhelming military power in the region, especially given US backing, does not require any serious compromise on its part.

If Israeli governments had not had such a sense of their own absolute power, of their potential for military domination, they would have moved long ago – as the parties in Northern Ireland eventually did – to seek compromise with their opponents. They would have explored ways of living peacefully with their Palestinian neighbours rather than inflicting further injustice on them.
That same sense of absolute power seems to shape the Israeli Government’s current approach in Gaza. Blinded by entirely understandable anger at the grotesque Hamas attacks on 7 October, it apparently believes that its overwhelming military strength, deployed in a self-evidently disproportionate way, will enable it to eliminate Hamas and to guarantee Israel’s future security purely through the force of arms.
Hamas, driven by its fanatical ideology and supported by Iran, has similarly deluded itself into believing that, someday, it will be able to achieve military victory. This madness led to their evil assault on Israeli civilians last month and contributed directly, and probably deliberately, to the suffering now being inflicted on Gaza.
As long as either or both parties to the conflict believe that they are powerful enough, in their different ways, to achieve a definitive outright military victory, the peace that all the people of the region deserve will remain a mirage.
One potential source of real power in the Middle East is the United States. Militarily and economically, the US could have compelled Israeli governments over the years to seek peace. In particular, they could have blocked the extension of illegal Israeli settlements on the West Bank which are stealing more and more land from Palestinians, even as I write this article. The US has the power, even today, to put an immediate stop to those settlements which make real peace progressively harder to achieve.
The real constraint on the exercise of US power does not lie in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem or in the region more generally. It lies in the United States where the hands of US Governments are still tied by a significant and influential section of public opinion.
It does seem as if Joe Biden is doing his best. He’s certainly a huge improvement on Trump who, as always, deliberately poured oil on the fire, including by provocatively moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem. Biden’s Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, likewise, comes over as a decent man as he undertakes his shuttle diplomacy around the region. However, Biden and Blinken both have their hands tied behind their backs by domestic politics.

McGuinness’s second point was about the effect that the ongoing conflict in Northern Ireland would have on another generation of children. Blinken was, I believe, sincere when he said recently that the death of each Palestinian child affects him personally, given that he has children of his own.
However, more than 4,000 Palestinian children have already been killed in recent days; more than 8,000 have been injured; and perhaps every child in Gaza has been traumatised for life. Yet Blinken finds himself obliged to insist that the US has set “no red lines” for Israel, something, were it not for domestic opinion, it could easily do.
The Israeli government is thus left free for the moment to pursue its illusion of military victory. In the short term, they will, of course, win. But in the longer term, lasting peace will necessarily involve justice for Palestinians as well as security for Israelis. If that is to happen, the United States will be obliged, at long last, to confront Israel’s dangerous sense of invincibility with its own power and values.
John Le Carré wrote, several decades ago, a fictional account of the bombing of a Palestinian refugee camp. He observed that an Israeli claim that the attack had killed only terrorist leaders was untrue “unless they meant future leaders for many of the dead were children”.

Israel agrees to four-hour daily humanitarian pauses to allow civilians to flee Gaza,"ISRAEL HAS AGREED to put in place four-hour daily humanitarian pauses in its assault on Hamas in northern Gaza starting today, the White House announced.
US President Joe Biden had asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to institute the daily pauses on Monday.
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the first humanitarian pause would be announced on this evening and that the Israelis had committed to announcing each four-hour window at least three hours in advance.
US President Joe Biden also told reporters he had asked the Israelis for a ‘pause longer than three days’ during negotiations over the release of some hostages held by HamasAlamyAlamy
He said Israel was also opening a second corridor for civilians to flee the areas that are the current focus of its military campaign against Hamas, with a coastal road joining the territory’s main north-south highway.
Similar short-term pauses have occurred over the last several days as tens of thousands of civilians have fled southwards, but today’s announcement appeared to be an effort to formalise and expand the process, as the US has pressed Israelis to take greater steps to protect civilians in Gaza.
Biden also told reporters he had asked the Israelis for a “pause longer than three days” during negotiations over the release of some hostages held by Hamas, though he said there was “no possibility” of a general ceasefire.
Asked if he was frustrated by Netanyahu over the delays instituting humanitarian pauses, Biden said: “It’s taken a little longer than I hoped.”
Israeli officials estimate that Hamas took 239 hostages, including children and the elderly, during its surprise attack on Israel on October 7 that also saw 1,400 Israelis killed.
US officials say it believes fewer than 10 Americans are among those held captive.
Kirby told reporters that pauses could be useful to “getting all 239 hostages back with their families to include the less than 10 Americans that we know are being held. So if we can get all the hostages out, that’s a nice finite goal”.
“Humanitarian pauses can be useful in the transfer process,” he added.

Indirect talks were taking place in Qatar – which also played a role in the freeing of four hostages by Hamas last month – about a larger release of hostages.
CIA director William Burns was in Doha today to discuss efforts to win the release of hostages in Gaza with the Qatari prime minister and the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, according to a US official.
Burns met with Mossad chief David Barnea and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said the official.
Qatar is a frequent go-between in international dealings with Hamas, and some top Hamas political leaders make their home in the Gulf country.
The US official stressed Burns was not playing a lead role in the negotiations.
Kirby confirmed that the US continues to have “active discussions with partners about trying to secure the release of hostages”, noting in particular Qatar’s help.
“We know they have lines of communication with Hamas that we don’t,” Kirby said of Qatar.
“And we’re going to continue to work with them and regional partners to try to secure the release of all the hostages.”
US secretary of state Antony Blinken had warned Israel last week that it risked destroying an eventual possibility for peace unless it acted swiftly to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza for Palestinian civilians as it intensifies its war against Hamas.

In a blunt call for Israel to pause military operations in the territory to allow for the immediate and increased delivery of assistance, Blinken said the situation would drive Palestinians towards further radicalism and effectively end prospects for any eventual resumption of peace talks to end the conflict.
French President Emmanuel Macronopened a Gaza aid conferencewith an appeal for Israel to protect civilians, saying “all lives have equal worth” and that fighting terrorism “can never be carried out without rules”.
Kirby said Uzra Zeya, the US State Department’s under secretary for civilian security, democracy and human rights; special envoy David Satterfield; and Sarah Charles, who leads the United States Agency for International Development’s bureau for humanitarian assistance, were representing the US at the Paris conference.
Israel has not been invited by France to the conference.
When asked about the decision to leave Israel out of the international talks, Kirby said: “We’re focused on trying to have the most constructive conversation there that we can.”","6.06pm, 9 Nov 2023",,
Debunked: Years-old video of hospital bombing in Syria claimed to show strike on Gaza,"
DRAMATIC VIDEO FOOTAGE showing a hospital being hit by airstrikes has been shared online, where it’s been claimed that it shows a recent Israeli strike on a hospital in Gaza.
However, the footage is at least seven years old, and was filmed hundreds of miles away, in Syria.
“Israel caught on camera bombing Al-Sadaqa Hospital,” a description posted alongside the video by an Irish Facebook user reads. “Not a single ‘Hamas terrorist in sight,’ only hospital workers and patients.”
Multiple other posts featuring the video also claim that it shows a recent bombing of a hospital in Gaza by Israel. Some have the exact same wording.
However, the video is at least seven years old, and has previouslybeen posted online, described as being from the Syrian civil war, an ongoing conflict between forces loyal to the government of Bashar al-Assad and rebel militants, which included both pro-democracy and Islamist groups.
The footage is described as showing a 2016 attack on a hospital by pro-Assad government forces in Aleppo City, Syria, which was under the control of the pro-democracy Free Syrian Army at the time.
The footage was published by the Aleppo Media Centre, a pro-opposition group that regularly uploaded videos of attacks in the region, including others that they describe as being the same place: the Omar Bin Abdul Aziz Hospital.
Advertisement
Certain features and rooms in the footage match, confirming that these videos were taken from the same location, and a 2017 analysis byForensic Architecture, a London-based research group, confirms that it was taken at the Omar Bin Abdul Aziz Hospital in Aleppo.
The hospital, which housed the city’s only pediatric department, was reportedly bombed more than a dozen times in 2016.
Pro-Assad government forces would later take control of Aleppo City near the end of that year.
Posts falsely claiming that the footage was taken in Gaza City give the location as Al-Sadaqa Hospital, described as being the only hospital offering cancer treatment in the Gaza Strip, built using a donation from Turkey.
The Hamas-controlled Palestinian Health Ministryhas saidthat “significant damage” has been done to that hospital from recent Israeli strikes, but did not report any fatalities.
Since the recent wave of violence in Israel and Gaza began, misinformation and disinformationhas surgedon social media sites, often described as evidence of actions by either Hamas or Israeli forces.
These include video game clips being passed off ascombat footage, years-old videos of attacks,military demonstrations, orfirework displaysfrom other countries being shared with descriptions that they show combat in Gaza; fake accounts formedia organisationsand journalists being used to spread misinformation; and doctored government documents.
False. A years-old video for a bombing in Aleppo in Syria has falsely been shared as a recent video from Gaza.

Varadkar on Braverman's NI 'hate march' comments: 'I'm not exactly sure what was meant',"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he can’t really interpret the comments made byUK Home Secretary Suella Braverman who used Northern Irelandas a point of comparison as she characterised pro-Palestinian demonstrations planned for the UK on Armistice Day as “hate marches”.
Speaking toThe Journalin Paris today, where theTaoiseach is attending a humanitarianaid conference on Gaza, Varadkar said:
“I can’t really interpret her comments. I’m not exactly sure what was meant.”
Writing inThe Times, Braverman said “hate marchers” intend to use the Armistice Day protest as a “show of strength”.
The Home Secretary also characterised alleged reports that organisers of Saturday’s march were linked to Hamas as “disturbingly reminiscent of Ulster”.
Braverman said: “I do not believe that these marches are merely a cry for help for Gaza.
“They are an assertion of primacy by certain groups — particularly Islamists — of the kind we are more used to seeing in Northern Ireland.

“Also disturbingly reminiscent of Ulster are the reports that some of Saturday’s march group organisers have links to terrorist groups, including Hamas.”

Her comments were in response to the announcement by the Met police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, that he did not have grounds to ban a march due to take place on Armistice Day.
With the Taoiseach somewhat bemused by Braverman’s comments, he said he would rather not comment further.
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood asid the comments are a “display of aggressive ignorance” that will only stoke division, while Sinn Féin’s foreign affairs spokesperson Matt Carthy said she had “as much knowledge about the situation in Northern Ireland as she seems to have about the situation in Palestine at the moment”.
However, he made the point that what’s happening in Israel and Palestine is a terrible conflict among people who can be at peace.
“I think it’s really important that those of us in other parts of the world don’t make it about us. People create parallels, there are some parallels with conflicts in other parts of the world, but this one is unique,” he said.
He said he hoped Palestine and Israel can be at peace one day, and maybe even be a partnership can be struck at some point in the future.
“If we’ve learned anything in Ireland, it’s that even after hundreds of years of conflict, peace is possible and partnership as possible. But let’s make sure the focus is always on people who live in Palestine, who live in Israel, not trying to apply it to ourselves or our own national experiences,” he added.

Fierce combat rages in Gaza City amid growing calls for ceasefire,"LAST UPDATE|9 Nov 2023

ISRAELI TROOPS AND Hamas are locked in heavy, close quarters fighting in Gaza City today, including a 10-hour battle that Israel said toppled one of the Palestinian militants’ “strongholds”.
Hamas fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and assault rifles were clashing with Israeli soldiers backed by armoured vehicles in the ruins of the besieged territory’s north.
Broken palm trees, mangled road signs and twisted lampposts marked the remains of what was once north Gaza’s main arterial route, an AFP journalist saw while embedded with Israeli troops on a controlled visit.
Israeli flags were flying over buildings at beach resorts in northern Gaza and there was little sign of any human presence amid the destruction as hundreds of thousands have fled a dire humanitarian situation.
The utter devastation is the result of over a month of war sparked by the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel.
On that day, gunmen from the Islamist group poured over the Gaza border with Israel and, according to Israeli officials, killed 1,400 people and seized about 240 hostages in the worst attack in the country’s history.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel retaliated with an aerial bombing and ground offensive that the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip says has killed more than 10,500 people, many of them children.
Stronghold and tunnels
The Israeli military said its forces secured a Hamas “military stronghold” in western Jabalia area in the past day, adding the troops had “finished securing the compound after 10 hours of combat”.
The battle raged above and below ground, it said, exposing some of Hamas’s extensive network of tunnel and subterranean bases that form a significant element of the militants’ capacity to fight.
Israel said dozens of militants were killed, while adding the overall death toll for Israel’s troops in the ground offensive had risen to 34.
The intense combat and the densely populated coastal territory being effectively sealed off have led to increasingly dire conditions for civilians.
Paris conference
French President Emmanuel Macron today urged nations to “work towards a ceasefire” between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, as he opened a conference on aid to the Palestinian territory.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is among the world leaders at the meeting in Paris. He told delegates that “failure” to observe humanitarian law “can’t be inconsequential”.

Addressing the conference, Varadkar described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as “grave”, adding there is “horror” at the large number of casualties, particularly children.
He called for hostages to be released “without precondition” and for foreign nationals to be allowed to leave Gaza. Around 40 Irish citizens arecurrently in Gaza.
Prime Minister of Palestinian Authority Mohammad Shtayyeh asked the conference: “How many Palestinians have to be killed before the war stops?
Israel won’t attend the meeting, which aims to mobilise the main players involved in the humanitarian response in the Gaza Strip.
Tom Potokar, chief surgeon at the International Committee of the Red Cross, described the scene at the European hospital in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza as “catastrophic”.
“In the last 24 hours, I’ve seen three patients with maggots in their wounds,” Potokar told AFP.
A rare delivery of emergency medical supplies reached Gaza City’s main Al-Shifa hospital on Wednesday, just the second since the war began, the UN and World Health Organization said, warning it “far from sufficient to respond to the immense needs”.
Thousands fleeing fighting
The army said 50,000 people had fled their homes in the main battle zone of northern Gaza on Wednesday, a sharp increase in numbers from earlier this week, adding to the more than 1.5 million people already seeking safety in the south of the coastal strip.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) confirmed the figure, and warned conditions were desperate in battle zones north of the central Wadi Gaza district.
“Hundreds of thousands of people remaining north of Wadi Gaza, including IDPs (internally displaced people), are facing a dire humanitarian situation and are struggling to secure the minimum amounts of water and food to survive.”
UN rights chief Volker Turk condemned Israel over its bombardment and its orders for to Gazans to flee.
“The collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians amounts also to a war crime, as does the unlawful forcible evacuation of civilians,” he told reporters at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, the only route out of Gaza not controlled by Israel.
An Israeli military official insisted the Gaza Strip was not in a humanitarian crisis, even as he acknowledged the Palestinian territory faces several challenges amid the ongoing war.
“We know the civil situation in the Gaza Strip is not an easy one,” said Colonel Moshe Tetro, head of coordination and liaison at COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body handling civil affairs in Gaza.
Efforts were underway to resume the crossing into Egypt of wounded Palestinians and dual nationals after departures were stalled Wednesday, with Hamas blaming Israel for a failure to approve the list of injured to leave.
More than 100 trucks carrying aid crossed into Gaza from Egypt on Wednesday, OCHA said, taking the total to 756 since fighting began last month, fewer than what would normally have entered Gaza in just two days before the war.
“The aid getting through is a trickle,” Turk said.

Border crossings stall
The evacuation of foreigners and wounded Palestinians through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, the only exit point from Gaza not controlled by Israel, has stalled.
Efforts are underway to resume crossings, but without a breakthrough so far.
Moscow today expressed shock after being told by Israel it could take two weeks for Russians to be evacuated.
There are currently 7,000 people waiting to depart via Rafah, but only 500-600 are crossing each day the border is open.
After the war
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected calls for a ceasefire unless the 239 hostages Hamas currently holds in Gaza are released.
According to a source close to Hamas, talks are underway for the release of 12 hostages, including six Americans, in return for a three-day ceasefire.
The United States has backed Israel’s rejection of a ceasefire, and G7 foreign ministers in Japan said on Wednesday they supported “humanitarian pauses and corridors”.
As the war intensifies, discussions on the possible future of Gaza once the conflict ends have also grown, after Netanyahu this week said that Israel would assume “overall security” of the territory.
US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said yesterday that it was plausible that “for at least some period of time” Israeli forces would remain in Gaza “to manage the immediate aftermath and security situation”.
Israel seized Gaza in the 1967 Six-Day War and withdrew in 2005. Two years later, Hamas took control and Israel imposed a crippling blockade.
In the longer term, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has suggested the Palestinian Authority — which exercises limited autonomy only in parts of the occupied West Bank — should retake control of Gaza.
“It must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority,” Blinken said on Wednesday, repeating the long-standing US call for a two-state solution.
Since the war broke out, violence has also gripped the West Bank, whose health ministry said six Palestinians were killed Thursday during an Israeli army raid on the northern city of Jenin.

"Failure to observe humanitarian law 'can’t be inconsequential', Varadkar tells conference on Gaza","LAST UPDATE|9 Nov 2023
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has told an international conference on humanitarian assistance to Gaza that “failure” to observe humanitarian law “can’t be inconsequential”.
He was speaking from the Palais de l’Élysée in Paris at an international conference which is being hosted by French president Emmanuel Macron.
The conference is assessing the deteriorating situation and the urgent humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza, particularly in terms of health, food, water and electricity.
Addressing the conference, Varadkar described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as “grave” and added that there is “horror” at the large number of casualties, particularly children.
He called for hostages to be released “without precondition” and for foreign nationals to be allowed to leave Gaza.
No Irish citizens have been able to be evacuated from Gaza since the opening of the Rafah crossing into Egypt last week.

Varadkar told the conference that the “number one priority” must be a humanitarian ceasefire “observed by all actors”.
French President Emmanuel Macron earlier urged nations to “work towards a ceasefire” between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, as he opened a conference on aid to the Palestinian territory.
“In the immediate term, we need to work on protecting civilians. To do that, we need a humanitarian pause very quickly and we must work towards a ceasefire,” Macron told delegates in Paris this morning.
Varadkar also said that there is an “insistence that humanitarian law should be observed.”
“Failure to do so can’t be inconsequential forever,” said Varadkar. “Double standards will lead to no standards if not checked.”
G7 ministers last night called for Israel to defend itself “in accordance with international law”, while Varadkar recently said that some of Israel’s actions in Gaza were“something more approaching revenge”.
When asked about Varadkar’s comments at a screening of Hamas attacks at the Israeli Embassy in Dublin on Tuesday, Israeli ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich insisted to reporters thatIsrael’s actions in Gaza are in line with international law.
Varadkar also urged attendees at the conference to “hold to the principle that Palestinian lives and Israeli lives are of equal value” and cautioned that there can be “no peace, nor security for Israel, without justice for the Palestinian people”.
“Seventy-five years of war, displacement, dispossession, and terrorism teach us that,” said Varadkar.
He added that peace can only come “through dialogue, diplomacy and politics, however difficult or unimaginable that may seem today”.

“From Ireland, we know that peaceful coexistence and indeed partnership is possible, even after a period of prolonged conflict,” said Varadkar.
“We as the international community need to support any initiative and new peace process that can bring people away from their weapons and back to the table.”
The Palestinian Prime Minister is in attendance at the conference, and he asked world leaders how many people in Gaza have to be killed before the war in the region stops.
Prime Minister of Palestinian Authority Mohammad Shtayyeh asked the conference: “How many Palestinians have to be killed before the war stops?
“Is killing six children per hour sufficient? Is killing four women per hour sufficient? This is an excess, this is greater than the number of people killed in Ukraine in 532 days.”
A World Health Organisation spokesperson this week said that an average of 160 children are being killed every day in Gaza as the war continues.
In his speech Shtayyeh said “the road to suffering did not begin on 7 October” – referring to the date Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,400 people.
“This route towards suffering has lasted for 75 years,” he added.
“I would like to remind you of the context; first of all, the legitimate defence is not the equivalent of occupying the region of others, there is a clear breach of international law and crimes being perpetrated against the Palestinian people.”
Shtayyeh added: “Today there are those who think that they might be the winners in this bloodbath involving children, but no one can justify killing children.
“What Israel is doing is not a way against Hamas, it is against all the Palestinian people. Since 7 October in the West Bank, 42 Palestinians have been killed.
“Time is valuable and in Gaza, six children are killed per day, the Palestinian people need international protection and the international community has to distance itself from this policy of double standards.”
Shtayyeh called for “an end to war, occupation of Gaza and the displacement of Palestinians”.
“The priority is quite clear, we have to save the wounded, we have to furnish electricity, water, medication.
“There are scourges that are beginning to spread due to the smell of death. More than 1,300 bodies have not been dealt with.”
Shtayyeh added that there is “clear condemnation of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority needs to work with the international community to battle terrorism”.
An Israeli military official today denied there is a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, even as he acknowledged the Palestinian territory faces several challenges amid the ongoing war.
“We know the civil situation in the Gaza Strip is not an easy one,” said Colonel Moshe Tetro, head of coordination and liaison at COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body handling civil affairs in Gaza.
“But I can say that there is no humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip,” he told reporters in Israel.

Tetro said the Israeli military was facilitating aid transfer to Gaza in sectors such as “water, food, medical supplies and humanitarian aid for shelters”.
The humanitarian conference has been hastily put together on the margins of the annual Paris Peace Forum.
It will aim to “mobilise all partners and stakeholders to respond to the needs” of Gazans, a Macron adviser told reporters yesterday.
Macron’s office also said that no Israeli representative will attend, but he will inform Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the results.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was in attendance and told the conference that “we have to protect lives and preserve humanity”.
She added that the European commission “knows Gaza very well” and is “one of the largest donors to the people of Palestine”.
She said the Commission has quadrupled humanitarian aid to Gaza up to €100 million in the run up to the conference.
However, she acknowledged that aid cargos reaching Gaza through Rafah crossing “remain too small to meet humanitarian needs”.
“We need to look at additional routes, and this is why we work very closely with the president of Cyprus to establish a maritime corridor,” said von der Leyen.
She added that there is a need to “think about tomorrow” and said the “hope” for the region must be a two-state solution.
Fighting is raging more than a month after the unprecedented 7 October attacks on Israel by Hamas, sparking the deadliest ever war in Gaza.
According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, more than 10,500 people, many of them children, have been killed by Israeli forces.
Recent weeks have seen growing calls for humanitarian “pauses” while Ireland has been steadfast in its call for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow aid to enter Gaza.
International concern over the fate of Gaza’s civilians, most of whom cannot flee the sealed-off territory, has prompted calls for a ceasefire.
But Israel has stated it will not stop until its objective of destroying the Palestinian militant group Hamas is achieved.
Netanyahu has said there will be no fuel delivered to Gaza and no ceasefire with Hamas unless the hostages are freed.

Medical NGO describes dire conditions in Gaza including 'amputations without adequate anaesthetic',"OPERATIONS AND AMPUTATIONS are being conducted in Gaza using inadequate amounts of anaesthetic, a leading NGO has warned as the ongoing siege enters its second month.
Dónal Gorman, a representative of Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) Ireland, has expressed hope that new doctors will be entering Gaza “imminently”,now that the Rafah Crossing has been opened.
“We’ve heard from our team last night, that the medical teams are still working with very little medical aid,” Gorman toldThe Journal.
“Horrendous stories of having to conduct operations and even amputations without adequate anesthetic.
Gorman said that hospitals on the ground, including the region’s largest facility Al Shifa Hospital, are “completely overwhelmed” due to the continued bombardment from Israel’s air and ground attacks as they continue their fight against Hamas.

Inside the Gaza Strip, MSF, a neutral and impartial medical aid organisation, has been working with hospitals in the territory, as they have done in other conflict zones for a number of decades.
Gorman told the eyewitness account of one MSF doctor, Dr Obaid, who saw an Israeli airstrikehit a Gazan ambulance as it entered the gates of Al Shifa Hospital last week.
The IDF justified this strike by claiming the vehicle was under control of Hamas militants at the time of the attack,though the attack was criticisedby other groups including Human Rights Watch as potentially against international law.
Gorman said Dr Obaid’s account says he witnessed and assisted doctors with immediately rushing victims into the operating room of the hospital’s emergency department.
Dr Obaid’s account says that some in the ambulance were killed immediately and there were “bloody bodies everywhere” in the direct aftermath of the attack.
Gorman said: “We as MSF think the deadly attack outside the gate of Al Shifa which impacted the ambulance was utterly horrendous.
“It was a lethal attack outside of Gaza’s main and busiest hospital – where our staff work daily to provide life-saving medical care.”
Gorman said the likes of these events are the reason why MSF is calling for an immediate ceasefire to be placed in the region and for increased aid to be brought in to help with the work of doctors in hospitals, such as Al Shifa.
“Hospitals should be protected spaces,” Gorman said. “And we call for an immediate ceasefire, to stop the bombardment of Gaza, to reiterate that hospitals, ambulances, and medical teams do have a protected position in war zones, and this should be respected.
“Patients and staff need to have safe spaces where they can be treated, and where our teams can treat patients [who have been] badly injured by weeks of relentless airstrikes,” he said.
Gorman said that fuel is running out, which has led to generators, providing power to the many remaining hospitals, to begin to fail.
“If you cut off a power supply to a hospital or hospital runs out of fuel for its electricity, you have to remember: Babies are are kept alive in incubators and a lot of medical equipment runs through electricity,” Gorman said.

“We need lighting to even see when doctors performing surgeries. So it’s incredibly important that fuel gets [into Gaza], along with other humanitarian aid including medical supplies,” he said.
Hamas, a Palestinian-militant group located in the Gaza Strip, launcheda major surprise terror attack in Israel on 7 October, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking 240 people hostage.
This was the worst attack on the country since its founding in 1948.
Since, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF)have waged an all-out war on the militant group, in an effort to eradicate them from Gaza, through launching a severe air bombardment and lethal ground offensive in the region.
The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry has said that 10,500 people, mostly civilians, have been killed within Gaza as a result of the Israeli military operations.
The bombardment of Gaza, now entering its second month, has led to 12 out 35 hospitals and medical care facilities being shut down in the region, according to MSF’s Irish representative.
Gorman described the situation on the ground as “truly dire” and said more need to be done in regards to the provision of increased medical aid, as fuel and painkillers are running dry in the area.
Israel has claimed that these resources are being stolen by Hamas and used to assist them in targeting Israeli soldiers.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said will take complete responsibility of the security of Gaza after the state’s offensive has concluded.
Foreign ministers in the G7 have released a statement saying that they supported “humanitarian pauses and corridors” in the conflict but refrained from calling for a ceasefire.
The United Nationshave made similar callsfor such corridors to be established and a ceasefire to be put in place.
Gorman said more doctors from MSF will soon enter the region, through the Rafah Crossing, in order to continue the organisations assistance.

Currently, according to Gorman, not enough medical and humanitarian aid is passing through the Rafah crossing, in the south of Gaza, which hospitals and MSF need to continue their work to save lives and treat the wounded.
“It’s a drop in the ocean, of the scale of need that exists, that’s managing to get through. So all of this, including the security context, makes it extremely challenging,” Gorman said.
“However, even within this, our medical teams and the medical staff in Gaza and our Palestinian medical colleagues are saving lives and helping people who have been under relentless bombardment for over a month now.
“Airstrikes continue to fall and airstrikes are hitting civilians – who are bearing the brunt of this bombardment.
“Medical facilities and ambulances have not been spared. And residential areas have not been spared, schools and refugee camps.
“This bombardment is affecting civilians most of all,” Gorman said.

Ceann Comhairle refuses Israeli ambassador request to show graphic footage of Hamas attack to politicians,"CEANN COMHAIRLE SEÁN Ó Fearghaíl has refused a request from the Israeli ambassador to allow a screening in Leinster House of graphic footage of the October 7 attacks by Hamas.
Earlier in the week, Elrich told reporters the footage was “historically important” – adding that she hoped to organise screenings for politicians in Leinster House.
Speaking toThe Journalthis evening, Ó Fearghaíl confirmed that the request had been denied due to the graphic nature of the video and the belief that it would be inappropriate.
The screening of footage of that nature had never taken place previously in Leinster House, with the Ceann Comhairle stating it would be “unprecedented”.
Ó Fearghaíl said he had informed the ambassador that he is happy for her to arrange and give a verbal presentation to politicians in the near future, but said “it’s not appropriate” to screen footage of such a graphic nature on the Leinster House complex.
While Elrich told reporters that the Israeli government had agreed with the families that the footage could only be shown at closed events with no recording devices present, the Ceann Comhairle raised concerns about the consent of families and the deceased.
The Israeli Embassy in Dublin screened the graphic footage it had proposed to show politicians to anevent for Irish media on Tuesday.

The screening comprised 43 minutes of raw footage and still images, including video taken from body cameras worn by the attackers.
Some has already been circulated on social media. Other footage has not been shared widely out of respect for family members of those killed.
Similar events have also taken place in other countries.
Speaking at the embassy, Elrich, said the events were being organised to counter what she described as a Holocaust denial-like campaign to discredit reports of the atrocities.
Speaking to his parliamentary party this evening, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said there are up to 40 Irish-Palestinian citizens in Gaza, including eight-year-old Irish-Israeli girl, Emily Hand, believed to be held hostage by Hamas.
He reiterated there should be a humanitarian ceasefire and all hostages released immediately. He said the Government’s priority was getting all Irish citizens and their dependents out of Gaza.
Ahead of attending a humanitarian conference in Paris tomorrow to discuss the violent conflict, Varadkar warned of growing signs of anti-semitism and Islamophobia spreading across Europe.
In the Dáil today there were fresh calls for Varadkar to expel the Israeli ambassador to Ireland.
Varadkar insisted suspending the diplomatic credentials of the Israeli ambassador would hinder Ireland’s attempts to secure Emily’s release and secure the safe passage of other Irish citizens from Gaza.

Their explicit aim is to remove Hamas as the government of Gaza.“The UK Government’s position has long been that we want to see a Palestinian leadership for the Palestinian people, committed to peace and committed to a two state solution.In the short term, it is inevitable that Israel, because they have the troops in Gaza, will need to have a security responsibility.“But our view is as soon as practicable, a move towards a peace-loving Palestinian leadership is the most desired outcome.“The UK position is clear.

The departures are being managed country by country on a phased basis. It will take some time for this process to be completed.“The names of all Irish citizens in Gaza who have asked to be included on the list of those due to leave have been submitted to the relevant authorities.

I’ll be meeting the Metropolitan Police Commissioner later today to discuss this,” he said, adding that he believes the pro-Palestine marches are “disrespectful”.Since those remarks, Sunak’s official spokesman at Downing Street denied that Sunak was overstepping the line.“No, that’s part and parcel of how Government and the Met operate. The Met are operationally independent, it’s the job of the Prime Minister and the Government to hold them to account for their approach. So, that is what the Prime Minister will be doing.”8 Nov 202312:52PMA group of children in Gaza have made an appeal for peace in a press conference held outside Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital.According to the health ministry in Gaza, Israel’s bombardment has killed more than 10,500 people – many of them children.Reporting from Al Jazeera shows one young boy outlining that they are drinking “unusable water” and plea for international leaders “to protect us”.“We want to live, we want peace,” the boy said in the appeal.“We want to live as other children live.”Palestinian children in Gaza held a press conference outside al-Shifa Hospital to plead with the world to end Israel’s bombardment.

This is the war of the free world,” he said.“We need to win this war in order to ensure that the West will not be next since terrorism, it’s like a cancer.”Israel has said the goal of its military operation in Gaza is to eradicate Hamas.Cohen said Hamas had used international financial aid to build tunnels and rocket factories while leaving Palestinians “starving”.He said Iran was behind Hamas and other militias targeting Israel.“We are not attacked only by the Hamas and by the Islamic Jihad. We are also attacked by the Hezbollah in our northern border and also by the Huthis in Yemen,” Cohen said.“There is one thing that connects them: Iran. Iran is the world number one financer of terror,” he said, accusing Tehran of trying to “stop the normalisation and the peace process that took place in the last three years”.8 Nov 20232:31PMAFP is reporting that Hamas has accused the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees of “colluding” with Israel in the “forced displacement” of residents of Gaza.“UNRWA and its officials bear responsibility for this humanitarian catastrophe, in particular the residents of the Gaza (City) area and north of it” who are following Israeli military orders to flee south, said Salama Maruf, head of the media bureau of Gaza rulers Hamas.8 Nov 20232:45PMBritish Ambassador to Ireland Paul JohnstonAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock PhotoBritish Ambassador to Ireland Paul Johnston has spoken to RTÉ Radio One’sToday with Claire Byrneabout calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.“There is a crucial humanitarian situation to be addressed but as both the British Prime Minister and the opposition leader have said, if you go for a ceasefire now, assuming that Hamas will respect a ceasefire, you’re effectively allowing them to regroup and begin their murderous campaign again.”He added: “We regret the loss of every innocent civilian life but equally there is a massive challenge there.“I was shocked frankly that 600 Irish academicsdescribed the eventsof the 7 October as an ‘incursion by a Palestinian armed group caused some criminal attacks against civilians.’“This was an appalling terrorist outrage and it’s right that Israel takes the steps that it has to take to make sure that Hamas can never impose that threat to the State and people of Israel again.”8 Nov 20234:09PMQatar is reportedly mediating negotiations between Israel and Hamas for the potential release of 10 to 15 hostages held in Gaza in exchange for a humanitarian pause.","11.28pm, 8 Nov 2023",,

 'Settlers have been pointing guns at Palestinians, telling them to stay inside'","FRESH MOUNDS OF earth and rocks block the dirt track leading to the Palestinian village of Susiya which lies in the southern Hebron hills of the occupied West Bank.
The roadblock was recently ordered by the Israeli military and it means that the Bedouin shepherding community living at Susiya now cannot access their homes by car.
Resident Nasser Nawajeh says that an Israeli contractor from a nearby illegal outpost installed the roadblock under the Israeli military’s order, and while he was at Susiya healso destroyedseveral of the community’s water cisterns and a field growing crops.

The playground by Nawajeh’s home in Susiya is empty and few people are outside that morning. “Settlers have been pointing guns at Palestinians and telling them to stay inside and not graze,” says Nawajeh, who is also the South Hebron Hills field researcher for Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem. On 13 October, an Israeli settlershotNawajeh’s brother-in-law in the stomach.
Since 7 October when Hamas launched its brutal surprise attack on Israel, there has been a dramatic escalation in the level of violence being experienced by Palestinian Bedouin communities in the West Bank.
Mohammad Nawajeh, who already left his land once before in 1948, says: “Our future is here..we will not leave.”Hannah McCarthyHannah McCarthy
Nearly 1,000 have been forced to leave their homes in the past three weeks,according to the UN. Yehuda Saul, an Israeli human rights activist and former Israeli soldier, says that this is one of the largest displacements of Palestinians from their land in decades.

“In the past, we were used to being attacked by settlers in the fields but now they come in uniform in the middle of the night into our homes,” says Nawajeh. “They put guns to our heads, attack the family, and give you an ultimatum that in 24 hours you either leave or we kill you.”
Susiya is just one of 19 Palestinian hamlets in the Hebron hills known as Masafer Yatta. One Palestinian from a neighbouring village in Tuba, who didn’t want to disclose his name for fear of reprisal, described how two days previously five masked settlers entered his house in the middle of the night while his family were sleeping. They searched his home, took his phone and his wife’s and threatened his family including his two daughters aged 7 and 9 with guns.

The masked men then took him from his home and beat him. After the beating, they told him that he had 24 hours to completely leave his house and if not, they’ll come back and they’ll shoot him. “I don’t have anywhere else to go,” he said, “This is my land and my home.”

Since the 7 October, many of the attacks and intrusions into Palestinian homes have been conducted by settlers wearing Israeli military uniforms. Under the Oslo Accords, Israel hastotal control in Area Cof the West Bank including over planning permission and security. This means that Israeli police are responsible for enforcing the law against Israeli settlers; while the Israeli military enforces the law against Palestinians. According to UN data from September, the follow-up rate in four out of five Palestinian communities where residents had filed police complaints about settler violence, was just 6%.
The line between who is a settler and who is a soldier has become increasingly blurred in the West Bank since the start of the war. “You have settlers that, half a year ago, came and beat up Palestinian civilians, and now they are in [military] uniform with guns,” says Shaul. “When we call the police today when we are attacked by a settler in military uniform, the answer of the police is that ‘it’s military operations and we don’t intervene in those,’” says Nawajeh.
Thirty Israeli human rights groups declared in astatement last weekthat “the Israeli government is supportive of these attacks and does nothing to stop this violence. On the contrary: government ministers and other officials are backing the violence and in many cases, the military is present or even participates in the violence, including in incidents where settlers have killed Palestinians.”

Nawajeh says: “What’s happening is that the settlers are taking advantage of the fact that all the attention is on Gaza and that the blood is boiling and the tensions are high, to speed up the transferring of Palestinians from the entire of Area C.”
Many of the older residents of Susiya are refugees who were forced to leave their homes in 1948 when it was included in the territory of the newly formed state of Israel. They joined family members living in the long-standing Palestinian village of Susiya.

“There’s a very long history and years of legal diplomatic political battles to remain in the land,” says Yehuda Saul. “If Susiya falls no where in the West Bank is safe for Palestinians.” Today, Susiya receives support from theWest Bank Protection Consortium, a coalition of EU countries including Ireland NGOs which fund projects for communities in Area C of the West Bank at risk of forcible displacement. The Irish Aid logo adorns one of the buildings in Susiya.
The village of Susiya has been demolished and forcibly transferredseveral times before. In 1986, the original site of Susiya was declared an archaeological site after an ancient Jewish synagogue was found there during excavations. In 2001, the residents were forced out from their new site after an Israeli settler was killed nearby. Then in 2011, there was a series of demolitions of homes in Susiya on the basis that they lacked permits for the structures from the Israeli authorities in Area C.

Each time though, the community has somehow returned to Susiya, despite the lack of basic infrastructure and permission to build proper houses and community buildings.

Some of the local settlers living around Susiyacome from Afrikaaner communities in South Africaand were originally Christian but converted to Judaism and moved to the occupied West Bank in the 1990s. (According to Rabbi Moshe Silberhaft, a spiritual leader of the country’s Small Jewish Communities Association, an average of five Afrikaner families convert to Judaism every year and South Africa’s rabbinical courts actively encourage them to move to Israel once they have completed the conversion process.)
Incidents of settler harassment and violent attacks have been regularly documented by residents of Susiya using video cameras and phones. But since 7 October, settlers and Israelis in military uniform have begun confiscating – and even burning – Palestinian phones and deleting photos. Now, Nawajeh says, “The worst violence is not videoed.”
Several Israeli activists have been staying at Susiya as a form of so-called “protective presence” for the Palestinians against increasingly violent and armed settlers. However, even they have become targets: on 25 October, a settlerfired shotstowards Israeli activists helping to protect communities in the South Hebron Hills.
“I started coming here a year ago and then I got very connected with the girls here,” says Az-Oolay, an Israeli clown from Jerusalem while entertaining two children from Susiya. “So now I come down where there are things happening.” The clown’s full character name is “Az-Oolay Yehiye Yoter Tov”, meaning “then maybe things will be better” in Hebrew.

Az-Oolay first began making appearances at anti-government protests in Jerusalem, believing the presence of a clown would challenge the heavily militarised security and help people see through hardened divisions in a city which both Israelis and Palestinians see as their capital.

Perhaps the most important thing protecting the community at Susiya is their “sumud,” a Palestinian term for perseverance and steadfastness. Nasser’s father, Mohammad Nawajeh, who already left his land once before in 1948, says: “Our future is here… we will not leave.”

Gazans flee south with makeshift white flags as Israeli bombardment continues,"LAST UPDATE|7 Nov 2023

CLUTCHING MAKESHIFT WHITE flags, Gazans made their way in between dead bodies and Israeli troops today as they followed Israel’s orders to flee south across the Palestinian territory.
“It was so scary,” said Ola al-Ghul, one of the masses of Gazan civilians displaced in the month-long bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
“We held our hands up and we kept walking. There were so many of us, we were holding white flags,” she told AFP.
The majority of the Gaza Strip’s 2.4 million residents have been displaced by the fighting, with around 1.5 million fleeing within the territory according to the United Nations.
Holding one of her toddlers, Amira al-Sakani recalled Israel’s repeated air drops of flyers, seen by AFP, telling civilians to flee to the south.
“We came by foot from the centre of Gaza to the south,” she said. “I was not expecting the distance to be that long.”
On the way, Sakani saw “bodies of martyrs, some in pieces”.
“We want peace, enough is enough, we are tired, we want a happy future,” she said.
More than 10,300 people have been killed across the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza health ministry. Most of the dead are civilians, including more than 4,200 children.
The bombardment has come in response to the unprecedented surprise attacks by Hamas on 7 October, which killed around 1,400 people in Israel, also mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and stressed there would be no ceasefire until the militant group releases its 240 hostages.
Sakani said her children have by now learnt what bombs are: “They tell me: ‘That’s dangerous mum, I don’t want any strikes’.”
Those seen fleeing by AFP journalists had few belongings with them, while some carried children or were using wheelchairs.
Haitham Noureddine said he walked four kilometres with his mother and other relatives until they reached the southern Bureij refugee camp.
He told AFP the family left their Gaza City home near Al-Shifa hospital, due to the heavy bombardment in the area, and saw decomposing bodies en route.
The Israeli military says its troops have encircled Gaza City but will allow civilians to leave the north.
But casualty figures show no area in the territory is safe, with nearly 3,600 people killed in southern and central Gaza, according to health ministry data.
Holding a walking stick, Hatim Abu Riash recounted his fear of walking past Israeli forces.
“Next to the soldiers, next to the guns, next to the tanks, the aeroplane… it was really horrible,” he said, after fleeing the northern Jabalia refugee camp, which Israel has repeatedly bombed since the start of the assault.
“We are not terrorists – we are civilians – we want to live in peace,” he added.
The Gazans’ plight does not end once they flee to central or southern areas, where more than 550,000 people are sheltering in 92 establishments run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
Facilities are limited and disease is rife. In one, UNRWA reported that more than 600 people were sharing one toilet.
There are also thousands of cases of acute respiratory illness, skin infections, diarrhoea and chicken pox, the UN says, while accessing basic supplies such as bread has become tough.
Standing on a dual carriageway as fellow Gazans walked past, resident Motaz El-Ajala described the conditions as “inhumane”.
“The situation is catastrophic,” he told AFP, as an elderly woman was pushed past in a baby’s buggy.
Iyad Shaqura, a doctor of pharmacy turned by war into an emergency physician, had become used to the flow of dead and wounded streaming into the hospital in Khan Yunis.
But yesterday evening, he fainted when he saw the bodies of his two children, his mother and his two brothers arrive at the emergency room.
His family had been killed by a strike that hit their home in Khan Yunis, in the south of the Gaza Strip.

This morning, his eyes filling with tears, Shaqura took a last look at his loved ones, draped in white shrouds and placed on the mortuary tables in the emergency room of Nasser Hospital, AFPTV footage showed.
Pointing at the bodies, one after the other, he listed their names: “My mother, Zeinab Abu Dayya, my brothers Mahmud and Hussein Shaqura, my sister Israa and her two children Nabil and Nur, and my two children, the apple of my eye, Abdelrahman, seven, and Omar, five”.
“I have five children, but he was my favourite,” said Shaqura, resting his forehead on the bloodied one of Abdelrahman.
His shroud and that of his brother were open at the face.
“What did they do to have tonnes of bombs and explosives dropped on their heads in their home?” he said, before adding with resignation, “God called them back to him like many other children before them”.
Gaza’s health ministry said today that 10,328 people have been killed in the month-long war, as UN rights chief Volker Turk decried a month of “carnage, of incessant suffering, bloodshed, destruction, outrage and despair”.
The suffering in Gaza has been immense, with entire city blocks levelled and bodies in white shrouds piling up outside hospitals where surgeons have had to operate on bloodied floors by the light of their phones.
Since the attack, Israel has relentlessly hammered Gaza with more than 12,000 air and artillery strikes and sent in ground forces that have effectively cut the strip in half, with soldiers and tanks tightening the encirclement of Gaza City.
Basic medical supplies are running low or have completely run out in Gaza’s hospitals but resupplying is a perilous task for humanitarian organisations.
Today the International Committee of the Red Cross said a humanitarian convoy carrying lifesaving medical supplies came under fire in Gaza City.
The convoy of five trucks and two Red Cross vehicles was carrying supplies to health facilities, including to Al-Quds hospital, when it was hit, an ICRC statement said, adding that two trucks were damaged and a driver lightly wounded.
The ICRC did not specify who had fired at its convoy or from what direction the fire came.
“These are not the conditions under which humanitarian personnel can work,” said William Schomburg, the head of the ICRC sub-delegation in Gaza.
“We are here to bring urgent assistance to civilians in need. Ensuring that vital aid can reach medical facilities is a legal obligation under international humanitarian law.”
After the gunfire the convoy altered its route and reached Al-Shifa hospital where it delivered the medical supplies, the ICRC said.
Later the ICRC convoy accompanied six ambulances with critically wounded patients to the Rafah crossing to Egypt, it added.
Prime Minister Netanyahu has said Israel would assume “overall security” in Gaza after the war ends, while allowing for possible “tactical pauses” before then to free captives and allow aid into the besieged territory.
Speaking to ABC News yesterday, he stressed that the war would continue until Israel had restored overall control of Gaza.
“Israel will, for an indefinite period, … have the overall security responsibility,” he said. “When we don’t have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn’t imagine.”
He stressed that “there will be no ceasefire – general ceasefire – in Gaza, without the release of our hostages.
“As far as tactical, little pauses – an hour here, an hour there – we’ve had them before.
“I suppose we’ll check the circumstances in order to enable goods – humanitarian goods — to come in or our hostages, individual hostages, to leave,” he added.
The United States said today that it opposed a new long-term occupation of the Gaza Strip by Israel.
“Generally speaking, we do not support the reoccupation of Gaza and neither does Israel,” State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said today that Israeli forces were operating “in the heart of Gaza City”.
“We are in the heart of Gaza City,” Gallant told reporters. “Gaza is the largest terrorist base ever built.”
Israeli troops stationed near the Gaza border told AFP they felt proud to protect their country but also nervous as the war intensifies.
Stationed near Gaza, a 20-year-old soldier who could not be identified said he was “a bit scared to go” into Gaza because “you don’t know if you can come back alive”.
Around 30 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the offensive, the latest yesterday, according to a report from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, citing Israeli sources.
The Israeli army said that in the latest battles its “troops secured a military stronghold belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in the northern Gaza Strip. Anti-tank missiles and launchers, weapons and various intelligence materials were located in the compound by the troops”.

Israel has air-dropped leaflets and sent text messages ordering Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza to head south, but a US official said on Saturday at least 350,000 civilians remained in the worst-hit areas.
The operation is hugely complicated for Israel because of the hostages, including very young children and frail elderly people, who are believed to be held inside a tunnel network spanning hundreds of kilometres.
Fresh departures from Gaza were announced today, with Romania saying 103 of its citizens and their family members have received permission to leave via Rafah.
The US also said it has assisted 400 of its citizens, residents and their relatives to leave the Gaza Strip after the reopening of the Rafah border crossing into Egypt.
“We have assisted more than 400 US citizens, lawful permanent residents and other eligible individuals to depart Gaza,” State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said, an update from a weekend figure of some 300 leaving.
It was unclear how many other Americans were still waiting to leave.
AFP video footage from the Gaza side today showed hundreds of people waiting with suitcases, bags and other scant belongings at the Rafah terminal complex.
A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs has said there are an estimated 8,000 foreign and dual nationals and immediate dependants in Gaza who are seeking to leave.
The Department said the departures are being managed country-by-country on a phased basis and it will “take some time for this process to be completed”.
“As of this morning, the Department understands that less than 20% of EU nationals in Gaza have been asked to leave so far. A further group, including EU nationals, is expected to leave today,” the spokesperson said.
“The names of all Irish citizens in Gaza who have asked to be included on the list of those due to leave have been submitted to the relevant authorities. Our embassies in Cairo and Tel Aviv are in regular communication with the authorities in Egypt and Israel in this regard,” they said.
“We are also in regular communication with Irish citizens on the ground and are updating them directly as we have confirmed information.”
On Friday, Irish citizen Ibrahim Alagha, who is trapped in Gaza,toldThe Journalthat Israel is “applying every kind of punishment you can think of” on the besieged region.
Alagha, his wife, and three children visited Gaza during the summer to see their family. He toldThe Journalthat they now find themselves “trapped in this war”.
Alagha said that he is receiving “at least a message a day from the Department of Foreign Affairs”.
“The message just gives an update, and the update is the same content every day – we’re trying, we’re hoping in the very near future (to evacuate you). But it is sent every day and that’s nice.”

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after a Middle East tour of crisis diplomacy, arrived in Japan today for a meeting of G7 foreign ministers set to seek a common line on Gaza as calls mount for a ceasefire.
As the war rages on, Blinken has also discussed options for who will control Gaza after fighting ends.
In a visit to the occupied West Bank on Sunday, he suggested the Palestinian Authority under president Mahmud Abbas should retake control.
Abbas said the PA could return to power in Gaza in the future only if a “comprehensive political solution” is found for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Hamas said it would never accept a puppet government in Gaza, and the senior Hamas official in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan, vowed that “no force on Earth could annihilate” it.
Pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel protest have been held around the world, with demonstrators voicing revulsion at the spiralling human suffering in Gaza.
In one of the latest demonstrations, hundreds of US Jewish activists peacefully occupied New York’s Statue of Liberty to demand a ceasefire.
One of them, photographer Nan Goldin, said that “as long as the people of Gaza are screaming, we need to yell louder, no matter who attempts to silence us”.

Dublin City councillors clash over next steps after failed 'peace flag' motion creates confusion,"DUBLIN CITY COUNCILLORS have expressed confusion and frustration after a chaotic monthly meeting where two emergency motions failed to pass.
An motion calling for the Palestinian flag to be flown above City Hall in an “act of solidarity with the people of Gaza”fell short of the required votesat last night’s meeting.
A separate vote of Dublin City Council for a so-called ‘peace flag’ to be flown instead ran overtime, leading to ambiguity about its result.
Independent Councillor Mannix Flynn, who represents the South East Inner City, described last night’s scenes as “peculiar and heated”, saying that the councillors “made a show of themselves”.
He said that the motion on a peace flag should not have happened without first determining what the peace flag – which has never been used before – would look like.
“You can’t fly what doesn’t exist on a flagpole,” he said.
Fianna Fáil Councillor Deirdre Heney, who put forward the peace-flag motion, said that its exact design would be decided on at a later date, after the vote. There is confusion among councillors about when, if ever, voting on the motion will reoccur.
Flynn suggested that a competition be run for school children to design a peace flag. He says it would teach them that “out of conflict comes peace”.
The motion in favour of flying the Palestinian flag on Dame Street was brought by the Independent Group of councillors but it also had the backing of Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats and People Before Profit.
Due to the numbers of representatives in attendance at the meeting, the ballot required three-quarters of the council – 45 councillors – to vote in favour for it to be passed.
The vote concluded with 39 votes in favour, 10 against and 8 abstentions – meaning the motion failed to pass.
Flynn has submitted his own motion to the council’s protocol committee, calling for the Irish flag above City Hall to be flown at half mast for three days as a sign of respect for those who have died in the conflict. It will be voted on at the committee’s next meeting at the end of the month.

Fianna Fáil Councillor Tom Brabazon believes that a peace flag is more appropriate if Ireland is to maintain its neutrality.
“I think picking sides in a conflict isn’t being neutral,” he said.
A neutral flag would be “a much more powerful signal and a less controversial signal”.
Green Party Councillor Janet Horner said that “in general” her party would favour symbols of peace over symbols of nationalism.
In the absence of “an obvious flag of peace”, Horner suggests planting an olive tree, which “holds huge significance in the middle east”, or making another gesture that demonstrates the desire for a ceasefire.
She said that, while she understands the merits of standing with Palestine, “our own experience in Ireland shows how powerful it is when the international community use their position and put their weight behind a peace process”.
A separate motion, brought forward by Labour Councillor Declan Meenagh, asked that Dublin City Council vote to support a report by Amnesty International that labelled Israel’s occupation of Palestine as “apartheid”.
The council was asked to support the report entitled ‘Israel’s Apartheid against Palestinians: A Cruel System of Domination and a Crime against Humanity’ as a “show of solidarity with the Palestinian people”.
The motion was suggested in April and was voted on this evening. The council voted in favour of endorsing the report, and therefore recognised that the treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli state is “apartheid”.
“I think we need to ask ourselves: What helped and what didn’t in our own conflicts?,” Meenagh said. “There’s lots of reasons it’s different, but more democracy helped. More violence didn’t help.
“I think it is appropriate that we recognise [Israel] as an apartheid state, and that’s to get out of this horrendous situation. I mean, I don’t have an answer. I just think that more democracy, more peace is how we do it,” the Labour councillor added.
The motion was supported widely by many councillors and passed this evening.
Meenagh said that he believes the council have served as an example to how the issue should be labelled and commended his colleagues for supporting the research conducted by Amnesty International.

'We can't wait for Europe to get its act together': Taoiseach told Ireland must take action on Israel,"“WE CANNOT WAIT for Europe to get their act together” in calling out Israel’s actions, according to Independent TD Catherine Connolly.
The Galway TD told the Taoiseach that Ireland must make it clear to Israel that it is not supportive of their actions, through trade restrictions and other mechanisms.
Israel’s deadliest war sparked by the 7 October Hamas attacks, has entered its second month as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed there would be no ceasefire until the militant group releases its 240 hostages.
Gaza’s health ministry said today that 10,328 people have been killed in the month-long war.
Connolly’s comments in the Dáil today came after Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns told Leo Varadkar during Leaders’ Questions that while words of condemnation are important, now is the time for action.
She called on Varadkar to call for the EU-Israeli trade deal to be suspended at the next EU Council meeting, which is due to take place in December.
On the basis of Israel’s breach of the human rights clause within the trade agreement, there should be a suspension, Cairns said .

“There are several things you could do, given what’s going on,” she said.
Cairns also called for the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill to be enacted as a matter of urgency.
The private members bill, sponsored by Sinn Féin’s John Brady, was pushed out for nine months by government. The bill looks to impose certain prohibitions and restrictions on investments made by National Treasury Management Agency in certain companies operating in illegal israeli settlements on Palestinian lands that appear on a UN Database.

Connolly said Ireland and many other countries stood “idly by” as Israel continued its illegal occupation of Palestinian lands over the years.
She stated that the government also chose not to grasp the opportunity with the divestment bill, along with the Occupied Territories Bill, which was omitted from the programme for government.
Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon told the Taoiseach that there is a need for Ireland to act unilaterally. “Do not be afraid to do so,” Gannon said.
Varadkar said the EU trade agreement with Israel is something for EU level discussions, stating that Ireland “can’t and should not act alone”.
“The truth is there is a very significant divergence of opinion within the European Union… the truth is there are very different views,” he said.

The Taoiseach was frank in his response that the position around the EU table is nowhere remotely near imposing sanctions on Israel.
Some EU countries strongly support Israel, Varadkar told the Dáil.
He said the role Ireland is playing is “possible”, stating the Irish government is trying to centre the EU “in a better place”.
Varadkar said the EU position has evolved in the past couple of weeks.
“I hope it will evolve again,” he told the Dáil, stating that Ireland will continue to use its influence to call for a humanitarian ceasefire.
The Taoiseach also said the “mighty vengeance” promised by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is warranted when it comes to Hamas, who killed 1,400 Israeli civilians, but not when it comes to the civilians of Gaza.
He said he is fearful at how long the war will go on for and is worried there could be an escalation,
“When the war is over, who is going to run Gaza  and who is going to rebuild it?” the Taoiseach asked, stating that no one seems to have those answers right now.

"UN calls for ceasefire as Hamas-run ministry says Gaza death toll passes 10,000","LAST UPDATE|6 Nov 2023
ISRAELI FORCES HAVE pushed on with intense strikes targeting Palestinian militants in Gaza as the offensive neared one month as the Gaza health ministry says the death toll in the territory has surpassed 10,000.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict, as he warned that the bombarded Gaza Strip was becoming a “graveyard for children.”
“The unfolding catastrophe makes the need for a humanitarian ceasefire more urgent with every passing hour,” he told reporters at the UN headquarters.
“These are massacres! They destroyed three houses over the heads of their inhabitants – women and children,” Mahmud Meshmesh, resident of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, told AFP.
“We have already taken 40 bodies out of the rubble,” he said as crowds prayed around corpses wrapped in white shrouds.
Determined to destroy Hamas, whose 7 October attack left 1,400 dead in Israel and saw over 240 hostages taken, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed no letup despite mounting international calls for a ceasefire.
Ground forces have flooded the northern half of the Gaza Strip and tightened an encirclement of Gaza City even as hundreds of thousands of civilians remain there despite Israeli evacuation orders.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip has said the death toll from Israeli bombardment of the Palestinian territory had surpassed 10,000.
The toll of 10,022 deaths was announced in a press conference by health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidreh.
This comes after it earlier said more than 200 people had died in “overnight massacres”.
In a statement, Christian Aid’s Head of Middle East Policy and Advocacy William Bell said that “today’s report of 10,000 Palestinian deaths in Gaza is a milestone that should never have been reached”.
“It must be a clarion call to world leaders, to redouble efforts to secure a ceasefire, to enable unfettered access to humanitarian aid, and halt the cycle of conflict,” Bell said, adding that a ceasefire “must be the first step in laying the groundwork for talks on a durable and just peace”.
“As we also mark one month since the horrendous Hamas attack on Israel tomorrow, we must be crystal clear that any ceasefire comes hand in hand with the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages.
Israel’s ally the United States has sent its top diplomat Antony Blinken on a whirlwind Middle East tour that has been marked by strong condemnation of Israel, including on his latest stop Turkey.
The heads of major United Nations agencies issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire inside the territory of 2.4 million people where an Israeli siege has cut off most water, food and fuel supplies.
“For almost a month, the world has been watching the unfolding situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in shock and horror at the spiralling numbers of lives lost and torn apart,” said the statement released yesterday.
“We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It’s been 30 days. Enough is enough. This must stop now.”

Israel’s army said today it had pounded Gaza with “significant” new strikes, having earlier said it had already hit over 12,000 targets.
“We will take the fight to Hamas wherever they are – underground, above ground,” Israeli army spokesman Jonathan Conricus said, repeating calls for civilians to leave the urban war zone.
“We will be able to dismantle Hamas, stronghold after stronghold, battalion after battalion, until we achieve the ultimate goal, which is to rid the Gaza Strip – the entire Gaza Strip – of Hamas.”
The Hamas-run health ministry said yesterday that 45 people were killed in Israeli strikes on a refugee camp in central Gaza, leaving people searching through the rubble.
Israeli troops and Hamas fighters have engaged in house-to-house combat in densely populated Gaza, where the war has sent 1.5 million people fleeing to other parts of the territory.
Netanyahu has remained firm on his position, vowing yesterday that “there won’t be a ceasefire until the hostages are returned”.
Shortly before the latest barrage of strikes, internet and telephone lines were cut, Palestinian telecom company Paltel said.
Israel has distributed leaflets and sent text messages ordering Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza to head south, but a US official said Saturday at least 350,000 civilians remained in the worst-hit areas.
Conricus accused Hamas of building tunnels underneath hospitals, schools and places of worship in Gaza to hide fighters, plan attacks and store ammunition – charges the militant group has denied.

Blinken on his regional tour – which took him to the occupied West Bank, Cyprus and Iraq yesterday – has called for “humanitarian pauses” while rejecting Arab countries’ demands for a ceasefire.
He met his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan in Ankara today.
Ahead of Blinken’s arrival in NATO member Turkey, which is allied to the Palestinians but also has ties with Israel, police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse hundreds of protesters who marched on an air base housing US forces in Turkey’s southeast.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan himself was travelling across his country’s remote northeast today, apparently snubbing Blinken.
Meanwhile, the Pentagon said today that a US nuclear-powered Ohio-class submarine was in the Middle East to help prevent war from widening. It has also deployed two carrier strike groups among other assets.
Some Ohio-class submarines are armed with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles, while others are configured to carry more than 150 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and the Pentagon did not specify which was in the region.

Turkey has said it is recalling its ambassador to Israel and breaking off contacts with Netanyahu, although Erdogan has said cutting diplomatic ties completely is not an option.
Meeting with Blinken in the West Bank yesterday, Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas denounced “the genocide and destruction suffered by our Palestinian people in Gaza at the hands of Israel’s war machine”.
In Iran, a foe of Israel and the United States, President Ebrahim Raisi has charged that US President Joe Biden’s administration was “encouraging” Israel to “kill and commit cruel acts” against Palestinians.
Raisi is expected to attend a summit in the Saudi capital on Sunday addressing the Israel-Hamas war, a source familiar with the preparations told AFP.
It would be Raisi’s first visit to the Gulf kingdom since the two countries agreed to restore diplomatic relations after seven years of severed ties, a deal brokered by China and announced in March.
The summit is being organised by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a 57-member bloc of majority Muslim countries based in the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah.
It is planned to take place one day after an emergency meeting of Arab League leaders on the war, also in the Saudi capital Riyadh.
“President Raisi will attend the summit of the OIC in Riyadh,” the source familiar with planning for the summit told AFP on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to discuss the plans with the media.
The OIC has repeatedly spoken out against attacks on civilians in Gaza.
Meanwhile, South Africa’s government has recalled its ambassador and diplomatic mission to Israel in condemnation of the bombardment of the Gaza Strip, calling it a “genocide”.
The government also threatened action against the Israeli ambassador to South Africa over recent remarks he made about the the country’s stance on the Israel-Hamas war.
Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, a minister in the South African government, said: “The South African government has decided to withdraw all its diplomats in Tel Aviv for consultation.”
Ntshavheni also said the position of the Israeli ambassador in the country was “untenable”.
Deepening the desperation in the crowded territory, the sole border crossing into Gaza from Egypt, the Rafah crossing, was closed yesterday for a second day.
Hamas suspended the evacuations of foreign passport holders after saying Israel had refused to allow some wounded Palestinians to be evacuated.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs confirmed the closure, saying more than 1,100 people had been allowed out in the two previous days.
The Rafah crossing has reopened today to allow the evacuation of foreigners and dual nationals from the Palestinian territory, the Hamas government said.
Six ambulances carrying wounded Palestinians arrived in Egypt today through the Rafah crossing, a border official told AFP. The patients were undergoing medical examinations at the border before being transferred to hospitals, the official said, adding the passage of foreigners trapped in Gaza was also expected to resume today.
There are around 40 Irish passport holders currently in Gaza and so far none have been able to leave.
Minister Helen McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that there isno list of evacuees for today.
“We don’t have any further information as to what number we might be on a list or where Irish citizens might be on that list,” she said.
McEntee said “there has unfortunately been a delay in citizens being released”.

She added: “We are using every diplomatic channel open and available to us to try and make sure that they are released.
“Everybody is concerned at what we’re experiencing and what we’re witnessing on an hourly basis in Gaza.
“But we need to make sure that we do everything we can to call for that humanitarian ceasefire as well to allow citizens to leave and humanitarian aid to get in”.
A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs has said that “there are an estimated 8,000 foreign and dual nationals and immediate dependants in Gaza who are seeking to leave”.
“The evacuations are being managed country by country on a phased basis. It will take some time for this process to be completed,” the spokesperson said.
“We continue to urgently seek to have Irish citizens included on the list in the coming days. Our Embassies in Cairo and Tel Aviv are in regular communication with the authorities in Egypt and Israel,” they said.
“We are also in regular communication with Irish citizens on the ground and are updating them directly as we have confirmed information.”
The Irish-Israeli child Emily Hand, who was feared dead in the 7 October Hamas attacks,is now thought to be aliveand being held hostage in Gaza, reports from Israel have claimed.
Emily, who is eight years old, had been on a sleepover in the Kibbutz Be’eri when it was raided by Hamas just over a month ago. She has dual Irish and Israeli citizenship as her father Thomas is originally from Dublin.
The war has exacerbated tensions in the West Bank, where more than 150 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces and settlers since the start of the war, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Hamas has admitted to firing rockets from Lebanon into northern Israel today, triggering Israeli airstrikes on the Lebanese side of the border.
The Qassam Brigades said in a statement that its militants fired 16 rockets on the town of Nahariya and the southern outskirts of the city of Haifa in retaliation for Israeli attacks on Gaza.
Haifa is the furthest city targeted by rockets from the Lebanese side since the start of the Israel-Hamas war nearly a month ago.
The Israeli army said approximately 30 rockets were fired from the Lebanese side targeting northern Israel, adding it was responding by shelling the origin points of rocket launches.
The exchange lasted about half an hour and Israel’s Iron Dome could be clearly seen intercepting rockets from Lebanon. Relative clam prevailed afterwards.
About three hours later, Israel’s air force carried out airstrikes on “Hezbollah targets” inside Lebanon, Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, adding that details would follow later.
Strong explosions could be heard in the area.
The exchange of fire came as Lebanon’s militant group Hezbollah said its fighters attacked at least three Israeli military posts along the border around sunset on Monday.
Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency also reported a drone strike on the outskirts of the village of Aramta near the southern city of Jezzine — a Hezbollah stronghold that is about 20 kilometres north of the border. This is the third such attack since the latest round of fighting began.
In Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, a female Israeli soldier was “seriously” wounded today in a knife attack before “border police forces neutralised the terrorist by shooting”, police said.
The Israeli military said today it had arrested Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi, 22, in a raid in her West Bank town of Nabi Salih on suspicion of “inciting violence and terrorist activities”.
Tamimi became prominent at age 14 when she was filmed biting an Israeli soldier to prevent him from arresting her younger brother, and for later slapping another Israeli soldier.
A large portrait of her was painted on the Israeli separation wall with the West Bank.
When AFP inquired about the reasons for her arrest, a security source forwarded an Instagram post, which has circulated widely on social media and is attributed to the young activist.
According to the post, written in Arabic and Hebrew, she called for the massacre of Israelis in explicitly violent terms, referring to Hitler.

'Have some humanity': Emily Hand's father begs Hamas to release her and other children,"LAST UPDATE|6 Nov 2023
THE FATHER OF Irish-Israeli child Emily Hand has begged Hamas to release her and the other children being held hostage in Gaza.
The eight-year-old girl was initially feared dead, but it has since emerged she may still be alive and being held hostage by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Emily had been on a sleepover in the Kibbutz Be’eri when it was raided by Hamas on 7 October.
She has dual Irish and Israeli citizenship as her father Thomas Hand is originally from Dublin.
Speaking to Gavan Reilly and Zara King ofVirgin Media Newstoday, Thomas said: “I beg you, on bended knees, to please release the children including Emily.”
He called on Hamas to “start with the children” and “maybe the women later, maybe the old people later”, before adding there is not much chance that the men being held hostage will be released.
“If you have any humanity inside of your body and soul, please release the children at least,” he said.
“For God’s sake, have some humanity, some pity, some humane feelings of any kind, please.”

Emily’s half-sister Natali earlier toldRTÉ’s News at Onethat her family has been informed by the Israeli Defence Force and “other authorities” that there is a “high chance” Emily has been kidnapped and is alive.
“We don’t know exactly the details, but we do know she’s kidnapped.

Natali’s mother was killed during the 7 October attacks and she said “it’s been a hell of a rollercoaster grieving about my mom and her (Emily)”.
“We’re like zombies, we have no tears left, we’re just broken and now we’ve got hope back and we’re strong now and we’ll do anything,” said Natali on reports that Emily is still alive.
‘Worse than death’
Speaking to CNN in the days following the Hamas attacks,Emily’s father spoke of his griefafter being informed that she had died.
Thomas said at the time: “They just said, we found Emily, she’s dead, and I went ‘Yes!’ and smiled, because that is the best news, of the possibilities I knew, that was the best possibility I was hoping for.
“The way they treat you, they have no food, they have no water, she’d be in a dark room filled with Christ knows how many people and for how many years to come.
“So death was a blessing, an absolute blessing.”
Natali today told RTÉ: “He (Thomas Hand) found out she was dead and as he was saying, nothing here makes sense.
“The thought of her being kidnapped and suffering, I don’t know what physical condition she is in, if they are starving her, I don’t know what they’re doing.
“It’s just a constant nightmare and he (my father) felt this way and I accept that… No one has a doubt that we want her back.”
Natali asked for “all the help” the Irish Government can provide and added: “I’ve never been there (Ireland) but I’m going to, I have to, and hopefully with my sister, my father and my brother.
“I have too many videos of her laughing and speaking, I want to hear that again. I just want to say ‘Emily, we’re on the way’ and we will have her back.”

Government response
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar today said the Government is doing its “best” toget around 40 Irish citizens out of Gaza.
He told reporters: “There are in and around 40 Irish citizens in Gaza and we’re doing our best to get them out.
“The Tánaiste has been in touch with Iranian authorities too. So, very much top of our mind at the moment; these Irish citizens held in Gaza for one reason or another, and very much a priority for us to do anything we can to facilitate their release.”
Speaking toMorning Irelandearlier, Justice Minister Helen McEntee said the Government is doing everything it can to support Emily’s family.
“This is a hugely traumatic situation for her family and for every family who finds themselves with their loved one held hostage,” McEntee said.
She added: “We’re doing everything that we can to support this family and others to make sure that people can be returned home safely to their families.”
McEntee also noted that the Irish Government has “called from the very beginning for Hamas to release any hostages that they might have”.
She added that “where Irish citizens are involved here, every effort is being made to support them”.
The Department of Foreign Affairs is “is providing consular assistance to her family”. “We will not be commenting further at this time,” a statement noted.
According to the Israeli Government, 241 hostages are being held by Hamas inside Gaza.
Most were taken by armed militants during the 7 October attacks in which 1,400 Israelis were killed. The death toll in Gaza hassurpassed 10,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.

Varadkar doesn't regret Israel 'revenge' remark amid attempts to get Irish citizens out of Gaza,"LAST UPDATE|6 Nov 2023
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he does not regret saying the Israeli response to the 7 October Hamas attack was becoming “something more approaching revenge”.
He was today asked if he believed the comment had hampered diplomatic relations with Israel over the exit of Irish citizens from Gaza.
Speaking to reporters in county Cork, Varadkar said he did not believe that it had. Asked if he regretted using the word revenge, he replied: “I don’t, no.”
He later said: “When the Tánaiste [Micheál Martin] and I take the positions that we do, we do so because we think it’s the right thing.
“Ultimately, this is about civilians. Israeli civilians who died and were injured, and also Palestinians who are now experiencing a very difficult situation.
“We’ve always taken a view since day one that we condemn Hamas’ attack unequivocally, no excuse for it whatsoever.
Varadkar said the Government is doing its “best” to get around 40 Irish citizens out of Gaza.
He told reporters: “There are in and around 40 Irish citizens in Gaza and we’re doing our best to get them out.
“We’re doing that through contact with the Israeli authorities, but also with governments in the area who may have influence, the government of Egypt, the government of Jordan.
“The Tánaiste has been in touch with Iranian authorities too. So, very much top of our mind at the moment; these Irish citizens held in Gaza for one reason or another, and very much a priority for us to do anything we can to facilitate their release.”
No list today
Earlier, Justice Minister Helen McEntee said it was unlikely that any citizens will be allowed to leave Gaza today. She toldRTÉ’s Morning Irelandthere is no list of evacuees for today.

McEntee stated: “We don’t have any further information as to what number we might be on a list or where Irish citizens might be on that list.”
Last week, the Rafah border crossing opened to allow foreign passport holders and wounded Palestinians to flee the besieged region.
Hundreds of people were able to cross the border into Egypt, but no Irish citizens were included in these groups of evacuees.

Gaza’s Hamas government suspended the evacuation of foreign passport holders to Egypt over the weekend, after Israel refused to allow some injured Palestinians to be evacuated.
“The terminal is closed because Israel prohibits the wounded from crossing into Egypt for treatment,” a source within Gaza’s Hamas government told the AFP news agency under the condition of anonymity.
“No foreigners will be able to leave as long as the injured are stranded” in Gaza, the source added.
Speaking today, McEntee said: “There has unfortunately been a delay in citizens being released.”
She added: “We are using every diplomatic channel open and available to us to try and make sure that they are released.
“But we need to make sure that we do everything we can to call for that humanitarian ceasefire, as well to allow citizens to leave and humanitarian aid to get in.”
Speaking toThe Journallast week,Irish citizen Ibrahim Alaghasaid he and his family in Gaza are receiving “at least a message a day from the Department of Foreign Affairs”.
“The message just gives an update, and the update is the same content every day – we’re trying, we’re hoping in the very near future (to evacuate you),” Alagha told us.
McEntee also told RTÉ that the Government is doing“everything that we can to support” the family of Emily Hand.
Emily, who is eight years old, had been on a sleepover in the Kibbutz Be’eri when it was raided by Hamas on 7 October.

She has dual Irish and Israeli citizenship as her father Thomas is originally from Dublin.
Emily was feared dead in the 7 October Hamas attacks, but is now thought to be alive and being held hostage in Gaza.
‘Not how diplomacy works’
McEntee criticised calls by Sinn Féin and others for the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich to be expelled, saying “that is not how diplomacy works”.

“We need to keep those channels open and Sinn Féin need to acknowledge that,” she said.
Also speaking on Morning Ireland, Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy called for the Irish Government to “take a lead in putting in place sanctions and penalties” on Israel.
He reiterated calls for the Israeli Ambassador to be expelled and said: “We want to cut off the diplomatic credentials of the Israeli ambassador because we believe that it’s important that we send an international message”.
When asked what impact such a move would have on efforts to evacuate Irish citizens from Gaza, Carthy said there “is an imperative on countries like Ireland to make a stand”.
“One of the ways in which we can make a stand is through ensuring that we send the message that we’re not going to have diplomatic relations with a state that is currently involved in obscene acts of violence against the Palestinian people,” Carthy said.
He added that there are “many ways and means in order to have some levels of communication”.

‘Nobody’s hands are clean’: Obama describes the situation in Gaza as ‘unbearable’,"FORMER US PRESIDENT Barack Obama has called for people to be able to hold seemingly “contradictory ideas” to find a solution to the Israel-Hamas war.
Speaking to the podcast ‘Pod Save America’, Obama also described what is happening in Palestine as “unbearable” and added that “nobody’s hands are clean”.
“If there’s any chance of us being able to act constructively to do something, it will require an admission of complexity and maintaining what on the surface may seem contradictory ideas; that what Hamas did was horrific and there’s no justification for it, and what is also true is that the occupation and what’s happening to Palestinians is unbearable.”
The latest Israeli death toll from the 7 October Hamas attacks, when militants launched an unprecedented attack into Israel, stands at more than 1,400.
Hamas also took more than 200 people hostage, witheight-year-old Irish-Israeli Emily Hand believed to be among them.
Israel responded to the 7 October Hamas attack by relentlessly bombarding Gaza and it has also sent in ground troops.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory has said more than 9,700 people, mainly civilians, have been killed.
Obama told the audience at the podcast recording: “And what is true is that there are people right now who are dying, who have nothing to do with what Hamas did.
“What is also true is that there is a history of the Jewish people that may be dismissed, unless your grandparents or your great grandparents or your uncle or your aunt, tell you stories about the madness of antisemitism.”

The former US president also questioned if he could have done more during his time in the Oval Office to prevent an attack like that on 7 October.
“If you want to solve the problem, then you have to take in the whole truth and you then have to admit, nobody’s hands are clean, that all of us are complicit to some degree.
“I look at this, and I think back, ‘what could I have done during my presidency to move this forward?’
“As hard as I tried, and I’ve got the scars to prove it, but there’s a part of me that’s still saying, ‘well, was there something else I could have done?’
“That’s the conversation we should be having, not just looking backwards, but looking forward.”
Obama added that these types of conversations “can’t happen if we are confining ourselves to our outrage”.
“I would rather see you out there talking to people, including people who you disagree with,” said Obama.
“If you genuinely want to change this, then you’ve got to figure out how to speak to somebody on the other side and listen to them and understand what they are talking about, and not dismiss it because you can’t save that child without their help, not in this situation.”
Obama also hit out at people debating the issue on social media and criticised what he referred to as “TikTok activism”.
“The problem with the social media and trying to TikTok activism and trying to debate this on that, is you can’t speak the truth.
“You can pretend to speak the truth, you can speak one side of the truth and in some cases, you can try to maintain your moral innocence, but that won’t solve the problem.”
The full podcast recording with Barack Obama will be out tomorrow.

Israel cuts off internet and phone lines in Gaza and launches intense bombardment,"LAST UPDATE|5 Nov 2023

PHONE AND INTERNET communication has been cut off in the Gaza Strip.
Israel cut internet and phone lines in the besieged territory today for the third time since the Israel-Hamas war began on 7 October, telecoms firm Paltel said.
“We regret to announce the complete shutdown of communications and internet services in Gaza after the Israeli side disconnected the servers,” Paltel said in a statement.
Shortly after the blackout, the Israeli army launched an intense bombardment on Gaza City and other nearby zones in the north of the enclave.
The explosions were so powerful they could be heard in Rafah in the far south of the Palestinian territory, according to an AFP journalist on the scene.
Gaza’s Hamas government also said the Israeli army was carrying out “intense bombings” this evening around several hospitals in the north of the Gaza Strip.
“For more than an hour, intense bombings have been taking place around hospitals,” said Salama Marouf, the head of the Hamas government’s media office.
The Israeli military confirmed the bombardment and said it had split Gaza in two.
Israeli forces “have encircled Gaza City… Now there exists a south Gaza and a north Gaza,” said army spokesman Daniel Hagari.
Ground battles raged throughout the day today in northern Gaza, which is still home to hundreds of thousands of people.
Israeli troops tightening their encirclement of Gaza City were seen engaged in house-to-house battles as tanks and armoured bulldozers churned through the sand in footage released by the army.
In a video taken from Israel’s Sderot along the border with the Gaza Strip, an Israeli flag was seen raised on top of a destroyed building.
Since Israel sent ground forces into the north of the narrow Palestinian territory late last month, “over 2,500 terror targets have been struck” by “ground, air and naval forces”, the army said today.
Since Israel’s siege and bombardment began, more than 9,700 people have been killed, according the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. Many more are thought to be trapped under the rumble left by Israeli airstrikes.
Leaflets dropped by the army again urged Gaza City residents to evacuate south between 10am (8am Irish time) and 2pm (12pm Irish time), a day after a US official said at least 350,000 civilians remained in and around the city that is now an urban war zone.
In the latest strikes in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry said, Israeli bombing of Al-Maghazi refugee camp last night killed 45 people, with an eyewitness reporting children dead and homes smashed.
“An Israeli air strike targeted my neighbours’ house in Al-Maghazi camp, my house next door partially collapsed,” said Mohammed Alaloul, 37, a journalist working for the Turkish Anadolu Agency.
Alaloul told AFP his 13-year-old son, Ahmed, and his four-year-old son, Qais, were killed in the bombing, along with his brother. His wife, mother and two other children were injured.
A military spokesperson said they were looking into whether their forces had been operating in the area at the time of the bombing.
Elsewhere, AFP has called on Israel for “an in-depth and transparent investigation” into the exact involvement of its army after a strike severely damaged its office in Gaza City, which has been shelled for weeks.
In the north of Israel, the army and the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah movement again traded fire across the border yesterday, with each claiming to have hit the other’s positions.
The skirmishes came after Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah warned that the war could draw in other forces in a regional conflict.
There is a contingent of Irish soldiers stationed on the Israel-Lebanon border as part of a UN peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL, and the Irish Defence Forces today confirmed toThe Journalthat all are safe and accounted for.
“On several occasions since commencement of hostilities UNIFIL, and specifically IRISHPOLBATT have been subject to GROUNDHOG (taking shelter in protected positions),” a spokesperson said.
“The Irish troops of the 122nd Infantry Battalion in UNIFIL continue to monitor the situation and to conduct planned framework operations. All Irish and Maltese soldiers are accounted for and are safe.”
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Palestinian President Mahmoud AbbasAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken faced a rising tide of anger in meetings with Arab foreign ministers in Jordan yesterday, where he reaffirmed US support for “humanitarian pauses” to ensure desperate civilians get help, a day after Netanyahu gave the idea short shrift.
Blinken made a surprise visit to the occupied West Bank today, meeting with Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas.
Blinken told Abbas that Palestinians in Gaza “must not be forcibly displaced”, a State Department spokesman said.
Abbas decried Israel’s “genocide” in the Gaza Strip.

“I have no words to describe the genocide and destruction suffered by our Palestinian people in Gaza at the hands of Israel’s war machine, with no regard for the principles of international law,” Abbas told Blinken in Ramallah, in remarks carried by official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
“The Secretary reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance and resumption of essential services in Gaza and made clear that Palestinians must not be forcibly displaced,” said a summary of the meeting released by the US State Department.
The unannounced trip came amid sharply rising violence in the West Bank since the outbreak of the war in Gaza.
Blinken and Abbas “discussed efforts to restore calm and stability in the West Bank, including the need to stop extremist violence against Palestinians and hold those accountable responsible”, said the State Department.
“Secretary Blinken reiterated that the United States remains committed to advancing equal measures of dignity and security for Palestinians and Israelis alike,” it said.
More than 150 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli soldiers and attacks by Israeli settlers since the start of the war, according to the Palestinian Authority.
Three were killed today in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Blinken’s meeting with Abbas, whose secular Fatah party is Hamas’s rival, came at a time Washington has heaped political and military support on its ally Israel.
Last week Blinken told a Senate hearing the Palestinian Authority should retake control of Gaza, even though it currently exercises only limited autonomy in parts of the West Bank and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long sought to sideline it.
Blinken has since left the West Bank for Cyprus, the nearest EU member state to Israel and the Gaza Strip, which has said it is working towards establishing a maritime corridor for aid to Gaza.
Blinken and President Christodoulides discussed the situation in the Middle East, government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
Their conversation at Larnaca airport included “a dedicated, one-way maritime corridor of sustained flow of humanitarian aid from Cyprus to civilians in Gaza”, Letymbiotis said.
Earlier today, Christodoulides said France, the European Commission and Israel backed Nicosia’s initiative to open a humanitarian sea route.
“On that basis, we are talking with the United Nations because the UN will receive the aid and not Hamas so that it reaches the population,” Christodoulides told reporters.
After raising the plan with European Union leaders last month, Christodoulides said he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Emmanuel Macron about the issue.
“The Republic of Cyprus is trying, within its capabilities, to ensure that humanitarian aid to Gaza is uninterrupted,” said Christodoulides.
He said Cyprus was taking the initiative as the nearest EU member state to the region – the island is about 370 kilometres from Gaza – and because of its good relations with Arab states and Israel.
“It is important that both the French president and the president of the (European) Commission have endorsed our initiative. We are working on the details so that it can be implemented,” Christodoulides said.
He said “we must be ready at any moment, and as soon as conditions allow it, to proceed with implementing this proposal”.
Asked whether there were discussions with Israel on a ceasefire to provide humanitarian aid, he said: “Israel, the prime minister himself, is in favour of our initiative.”
“We are discussing the details… because the maritime area around Gaza does not allow for ships to approach.”
Last week, Cyprus Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos visited Jordan and the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
Christodoulides has also involved Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in the talks.
Cyprus already serves as a transit hub for foreign nationals evacuated from Israel because of the war.
Later today, Blinken is expected in Turkey, whose President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has held Netanyahu personally responsible for Gaza’s growing civilian death toll.
Turkey declared yesterday that it was recalling its ambassador to Israel and breaking off contacts with Netanyahu due to Israel’s unwillingness to implement a ceasefire.
Washington has rebuffed calls for a ceasefire, instead backing Israel’s goal of crushing Hamas militants in Gaza.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, whose country has been acting as the sole conduit for foreigners to escape the Gaza Strip and for aid to get in, called for an “immediate and comprehensive ceasefire”.
Speaking to RTÉ’s This Week today, Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Micheál Martin said that “we certainly could be watching war crimes unfolding”.
“The International Criminal Court has jurisdiction, prosecutors have made that clear, in the Middle East. I believe there should be full accountability for what is happening here,” Martin said.
“I’ve always been of the view that the bombing of dense urban areas … you cannot do it without killing civilians and killing children and I don’t believe there has been any proportionality attached to this. It’s disproportionate by any measure and it’s not necessary,” he said.
The Tánaiste said the the Hamas attack on 7 October was “savage, brutal, barbaric” and that Israel has a right to take on Hamas.

“But it’s the pursuit and the manner and the methodology I think people are questioning. You cannot take out a civilian population along with that, you cannot make calculations that if I get one Hamas commander it’s ok to take out 100 civilians,” he said.
“I think intelligence-led approaches to terrorism have always been more effective.”
The call for a ceasefire was echoed by thousands of protesters in Washington in solidarity with Palestinians, one of multiple rallies held from Indonesia to Iran as well as in European cities.
Thousands also demonstrated in Israel yesterday as pressure mounts on Netanyahu over his government’s lack of preparedness for the 7 October attacks and its handling of the hostage crisis.
In Tel Aviv, several thousand took to the streets, including relatives and friends of some of the hostages, chanting “bring them home now”.
In Jerusalem, hundreds came together outside Netanyahu’s residence with more explicit calls for his resignation.
A pro-Palestine demonstration was held on the streets Dublin yesterday, making it the fourth weekend in a row to see such a rally.
Posts on social media showed crowds of people marching the streets calling for a ceasefire and chanting pro-Palestinian slogans.
Hamas said last night the evacuation of dual nationals and foreigners from Gaza was being suspended until Israel lets some wounded Palestinians reach Rafah so they can cross the border for hospital treatment in Egypt.
A senior White House official said Hamas had tried to use a US-brokered deal opening the Egyptian border crossing to get its cadres out.
“That was just unacceptable to Egypt, to us, to Israel,” the official said.
Concluding a two-day visit to Egypt, Cindy McCain, head of the World Food Programme, today appealed for more aid for Gaza, stressing that trucks allowed in so far are no match for needs on the ground.
“Right now, parents in Gaza do not know whether they can feed their children today and whether they will even survive to see tomorrow. The suffering just metres away is unfathomable standing on this side of the border,” she said after visiting the Rafah border crossing.
“Today, I’m making an urgent plea for the millions of people whose lives are being torn apart by this crisis.”
Israel’s UN ambassador has said that he wore a yellow star at a recent Security Council hearing to “shock” the body into condemning Hamas, after his action drew rebukes even from home.
Gilad Erdan’s choice a week ago to wear the badge, which has come to symbolize the oppression of Jews since its imposition in Nazi-occupied Europe, was swiftly criticized by Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial, which urged him to wear the Israeli flag instead.
“This act disgraces the victims of the Holocaust as well as the state of Israel,” the memorial’s chair Dani Dayan said in a Hebrew-language post on X, formerly Twitter.

Speaking to CNN today, Erdan defended the move and denounced the Security Council again for its “silence” over the unprecedented attacks by Hamas Palestinian militants against Israel on 7 October.
“I just want to emphasize that my goal was to first of all shock the Security Council,” Erdan said of his controversial choice to wear the star.
The deeply divided 15-member body has yet to adopt a single resolution on the attack or on Israel’s decision to launch a retaliatory war against Hamas.
“I wanted to shock them. I wanted to remind them of their silence and I wanted to convey a message that we – not like in the past – we are not weak as we were during the Holocaust,” Erdan said.
For weeks the Security Council has been riven by divisions over the war and its impact, rejecting four draft resolutions about the conflict.
Some texts were blocked by the United States, a close Israel ally, because they did not mention Israel’s right to defend itself.
Another presented by the Americans was stymied by Russia and China in particular because it did not clearly call for a ceasefire.
In light of the deadlock, the UN General Assembly last Friday adopted by a large majority a nonbinding resolution requesting an “immediate humanitarian truce,” but without mentioning Hamas.
Nevertheless, Erdan warned that Israel would not back down.
“We will continue to fight without any peace ceasefires until we eradicate Hamas,” he said.

Israeli minister suspended from govt meetings after suggesting dropping nuclear bomb on Gaza,"
AN ISRAELI MINISTER has been suspended from government meetings “until further notice”, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has said, after suggesting in an interview dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza.
The comments by Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu advocating a fierce military response to Hamas’s 7 October attacks even at the cost of the lives of hostages believed to be held in Gaza also drew rebuke from families of the captives.
Eliyahu, an ultranationalist politician part of Netnayahu’s ruling coalition, told Israel’s Kol Barama radio he was not entirely satisfied with the scale of Israel’s retaliation in the Palestinian territory after Hamas fighters carried out their deadly attacks inside southern Israel.
The attacks killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, Israeli officials say.
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza since 7 October has killed 9,488 people, most of them women and children, the Hamas-run health ministry says.
When the interviewer asked whether the Israeli minister advocated dropping “some kind of atomic bomb” on the Gaza Strip “to kill everyone”, Eliyahu replied: “That’s one option.”

Netanyahu’s office quickly responded in a statement, describing Eliyahu’s remarks as “disconnected from reality” and adding that Israel was trying to spare “non-combatants” in Gaza.
In a follow-up question about the estimated 240 hostages held in Gaza, Eliyahu said that “in war we pay a price”.
“Why are the lives of the hostages … more important than the lives of the soldiers?” he said.
The Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum, representing relatives of people snatched to Gaza by Hamas militants, slammed Eliyahu’s “reckless and cruel” statement.
“International law, along with fundamental principles of human morality and common sense, strictly prohibits the use of mass destruction weapons,” it said in a statement, calling for the release of all the hostages.
Following the outcry over his remarks, Eliyahu said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that his statement about the atomic bomb was “metaphorical”.
He also said that Israel was “committed to doing everything possible to return the hostages safe and sound”.
Israel has never admitted to having a nuclear bomb.

Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said Eliyahu’s remarks reveal that “Israel possesses nuclear weapons, which is an open secret”.
“But it confirms the truth of the racist view Israelis hold against Palestinians. This is the true face of the occupation government.”
Saudi Arabia criticised the Netanyahu government for not dismissing him.
“Failing to immediately dismiss the minister from the government and simply freezing his membership reflects the height of disdain for all human, moral, religious and legal standards and values of the Israeli government,” the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement.
Jordan said the minister’s remarks were a “call for genocide and a hate crime” against the Palestinians.

What explains diplomatic accusations of antisemitism against Ireland?,"LAST WEEK, IRELAND was one of 120 United Nations member states to vote in favour of a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas and demanding aid access to Gaza.
It is yet another foreign policy stance that sets Ireland at odds with many of its European Union partners, as well as other nations typically thought of as allies such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada. Nearly three quarters of Ireland’s EU neighbours either abstained from voting or voted against the motion entirely, as in the case of Austria, Croatia, Czechia and Hungary.
The vote was broadly in line with the Irish government’s public pronouncements on the conflict since 7 October. In a statement issued on Wednesday morning, Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said of civilian casualties in Gaza: “This cannot continue, this has to stop.”
Irish attitudes – both those expressed by the State and the attitudes of the public at large – have been publicly cast as antagonistic by certain high-profile diplomats.
Israel’s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen has in the past week publicly referred to Ireland as “one of the more challenging arenas for Israel in Europe”. His comments came after an Israeli diplomat based in Ireland’s Israeli embassy tweeted: “#Ireland Wondering who funded those tunnels of terror? A short investigation direction – 1. Find a mirror 2. Direct it to yourself 3. Voilà.” This tweet was later deleted, with the Israeli Embassy clarifying that “the text and wording were wrong”.
A tweet by the German Embassy to Ireland this week quoted German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck as saying “Anticolonialism must not lead to antisemitism,” framing the statement as a “reminder to Ireland”.
Historically, Ireland was the first EU member state to declare that peace in the region “had to be based on a fully sovereign State of Palestine”, in a joint statement alongside Bahrain in 1980.
Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs continues to acknowledge the seizure of land for Israeli settlements, evictions of families, destruction of homes and farm buildings… and unequal treatment” faced by Palestinians.
For decades, Ireland has officially been calling for “a permanent and sustainable ceasefire” as well as the lifting of the blockade on Gaza, and ultimately the establishment of a two-state solution which is based on the borders of 1967 – before Israel tripled its territory in the aftermath of the Six Day War.
With specific reference to Israel, the Department of Foreign Affairs says: “Any use of military force in self defence must be in accordance with international humanitarian law, and in particular must be both discriminate and proportionate.”

""Anticolonialism must not lead to antisemitism"" - an important and timely reminder from Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, both for Germany and Ireland.https://t.co/3IwEfINGzr
Speaking toThe Journalthis week, Professor of Politics at DCU Donnacha Ó Beacháin said: “There has been a rather robust, to put it mildly, campaign by the Israeli embassy to defend its own position but also to counteract those which it perceives to be adversarial.
“The view that is often presented by some sections of the Israeli media is that Ireland is the most hostile country in the European Union towards Israel,” Ó Beacháin added.

This rhetoric has boiled over amongst many ordinary social media users who are also referring to Ireland in antagonistic terms.
One post, seen over 300,000 times on Twitter, listed Ireland as among the “forces of darkness,” cherry-picking more of the 120 nations who voted in favour of a calling for an immediate humanitarian truce, such as Russia, China, and Iran.
While events in Gaza have intensified such rhetoric, this tension between Ireland and Israel is not new. The day before Hamas’ brutal attack, The Jerusalem Post ran a feature reflecting on Micheál Martin’s visit to Israel in September which explicitly asked: “Is Ireland ready to acknowledge their Nazi-sympathizer past?” Other headlines from that same publication include:“Irish anti-Israel sentiment almost indivisible from antisemitism”,“Why does Ireland hate Israel?”, and“Ireland’s delusional orgy of criticism of Israel”.
Ó Beacháin notes that, in editorials such as these, that there is an attempt to link modern Ireland’s attitude towards Israel to Eamon De Valera’s infamous visit to the German ambassador in Dublin in 1945 following the death of Adolf Hitler. Such editorials give the impression that Ireland’s attitude towards the conflict in Palestine “is linked to a deep-seated antisemitism in Ireland”.
Just weeks before Hamas’ attack on 7 October, Micheál Martin had visited the region, and appealed for a return to the negotiating table by both Israel and Palestine. During the visit, Martin said: “It matters to me personally as someone who’s been involved both in foreign policy and in being part of bringing peace to the island of Ireland for the 40 plus years of my political life.”
During this trip, Martin visited the World Holocaust Remembrance Centre in Yad Veshem, and told reporters: “It is only through remembrance and education that we can ensure that nothing like the Holocaust can be allowed to happen again.”
While the Occupied Territories Bill, opposed by Fine Gael and omitted from the programme for government when the current coalition was formed in 2020, would see a ban on a legislative ban on goods from Israeli-occupied territories, the bill’s progress through the Oireachtasappears to have stalled.
Speaking toThe Journallast month Maurice Cohen, Chariman of Ireland’s Jewish Representative council said the Jewish community has experienced “major support from the non-Jewish community” in the wake the Hamas attacks which saw 1,400 people killed and hundreds more abducted. Although Cohen said there has been “no major increase” in real-life antisemitic incidents in Ireland, he pointed to an obvious increase in online antisemitic rhetoric, adding that Irish elected officials had not done enough to condemn the 7 October attack.
One such real life incidentwas recorded this week, however, when a Star of David was graffitied alongside a swastika in Tramore, Co Waterford.
A survey conducted by the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish NGO and civil rights group which supports the state of Israel, found that Ireland generally scores better than the average western European country when it comes to anti-semitic beliefs.
The survey is based on how many respondents from an area agree with statements such as: “Jews have too much power in the business world” and “Jews are responsible for most of the world’s wars”. Ireland’s index score is 20%, lower than the 24% regional average.
Ó Beacháin argues that it is not antisemitism that drives the broad Irish affinity with the Palestinian cause, however.
“The reality is that Ireland has a longstanding policy of empathising with those it considers to be victims of injustice,” says Ó Beacháin, citing Ireland’s domestic protest movements against apartheid-era South Africa.
“I wouldn’t take Israel-Palestine out of context. I think it’s part of a consistent practice of Irish people empathising with the underdog, and I think that goes to our own history, which is marked by imperialism and settler-colonialism.”

Israeli military and Lebanon's Hezbollah engage in major cross-border clashes,"
THE ISRAELI MILITARY and powerful Lebanese movement Hezbollah have engaged in cross-border clashes today, with each claiming to have hit the other’s positions along the frontier.
The latest skirmishes came a day after Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah warned that the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip could turn into a regional conflict if Israel pushed on with its offensive in the Palestinian territory.
Today, the Israeli military said it had struck “two terrorist cells” and a Hezbollah post after an attempted attack from Lebanon.
“In response to two terrorist cells attempting to fire from Lebanon toward Israeli territory, the IDF (military) struck the cells and a Hezbollah observation post,” a military statement said.
It said it had also responded to mortar fire from Lebanon into northern Israel, where no casualties were reported.
Hezbollah said it had simultaneously attacked five Israeli positions along the border.

Hours later it announced a new attack on the Al-Abbad Israeli position, without specifying what kind of weapon was used.
Israel’s military said in a separate statement that its fighter jets struck “terror targets” of Hezbollah, accompanied by tank and artillery fire.
“The Hezbollah targets struck include terror infrastructure, rocket storage sites and military compounds,” it said.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant visited troops on the northern border today and reiterated that Israel had no interest in engaging in a war there.
“But we are prepared for every mission,” Gallant said in a statement.
“Yahya Sinwar made a mistake and sealed Hamas’s fate in Gaza and of Gaza,” he said of the militant group’s chief in Gaza.
He said that if Nasrallah makes “a mistake, he will determine Lebanon’s fate”.
The Lebanon-Israel border has seen regular cross-border shelling over the past month, with firing between the Israeli military on one side and the powerful Hezbollah and its allies on the other.

In his first speech since the Israel-Hamas war broke out four weeks ago, Nasrallah warned yesterday that “all options” were open for an expansion of the conflict to Lebanon as he blamed the United States for the war in Gaza.
“America is entirely responsible for the ongoing war on Gaza and its people, and Israel is simply a tool of execution,” Nasrallah said in a televised broadcast, calling the conflict “decisive”.
“Whoever wants to prevent a regional war – and this is addressed to the Americans – must quickly stop the aggression on Gaza,” he said.
Irish troops with UNIFIL are based at three locations in Lebanon – Camp 6-52 which is an outpost on the Israeli border and then their main base at Camp Shamrock near At Tiri. There is also a small group in UNIFIL headquarters on the coast at Naqoura.
Since 7 October, Israel has been engaged in a fierce war with Gaza rulers Hamas after the Palestinian militant group carried out a deadly attack in southern Israel that killed 1,400 people, mainly civilians, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has retaliated with relentless strikes and a ground invasion of Gaza, where more than 9,400 people, also mostly civilians, have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

Israeli airstrike kills 15 in UN school in Gaza as Turkey recalls ambassador,"LAST UPDATE|4 Nov 2023
ISRAEL HAS RESISTED US calls for a pause in fighting and continued its siege of Gaza City today, after deadly strikes hit an ambulance convoy and a school-turned-refugee shelter.
As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rebuffed pressure from visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to enact a temporary humanitarian pause, the nearly month-old bombardment of Gaza raged on unabated.
Elsewhere at the diplomatic level, Turkey has recalled its ambassador to Israel for consultations due to Israel’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza, although it stopped short of completely severing diplomatic ties.
Israeli ground forces have encircled Gaza’s largest city, trying to rout Hamas in retaliation for 7 October raids that killed an estimated 1,400 people inside Israel, most of them civilians.
The health ministry in the Gaza Strip said today that at least 9,488 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since Israel began its bombardment last month.
An Israeli airstrike has killed 15 people in a United Nations school where thousands of displaced Palestinians were sheltering, the Gaza health ministry said.
“The massacre at the Al-Fakhura school committed by the (Israeli) occupation this morning left 15 martyrs and 70 wounded,” ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra told a press conference.
The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees said its school is being used as a “shelter for displaced families”.
“At least one strike hit the school yard where there were tents for displaced families. Another strike hit inside the school where women were baking bread,” UNRWA said in a statement.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military about hitting the school in Jabalia refugee camp, and AFP was unable to independently confirm the toll.
Elsewhere, at the Osama bin Zaid Boys School north of Gaza City, AFP saw the aftermath of what Hamas authorities said was Israeli tank shelling that killed 20 people.
Ambulance teams rushed into the debris-littered building to aid the injured and remove the dead.
Stunned onlookers wept and wandered the scene with hands clasped above the head in horror and disbelief.
Israel’s military describes Gaza City as “the centre of the Hamas terror organisation” and says it is targeting Hamas operatives, weapons stores, tunnel complexes, drone launching posts and command centres there.
Spokesman Richard Hecht said forces were engaged in “very intense, close quarters combat” with Hamas fighters.
But with strikes and ground fighting taking place in densely populated urban areas, many civilians have died.

Speaking in Tel Aviv, Blinken accused Hamas of “cynically and monstrously” using civilians as “human shields”, and of deliberately locating military assets “beneath residential buildings, schools, mosques, hospitals.”
Netanyahu, who has made a political career out of hawkish security policies, warned that there could be no “temporary truce” in Gaza until Hamas releases the hostages.
Israel says it has struck 12,000 targets across the Palestinian territory since “Operation Iron Swords” began on 7 October, one of the fiercest bombing campaigns in recent memory.
In Gaza City’s centre, there was another strike yesterday, this one on the doorstep of the territory’s largest hospital Al-Shifa.
Israel’s military said it had targeted an ambulance which it claimed was being used by a “Hamas terrorist cell”, saying it had “neutralised” those inside.
“We emphasise that this area in Gaza is a war zone. Civilians are repeatedly called upon to evacuate southward for their own safety,” the Israel Defense Forces said.

The Hamas government said 15 people were killed, mirroring figures released by the Palestinian Red Crescent.
An AFP journalist saw multiple bodies beside the blood-splattered Palestinian Red Crescent vehicle, which aligns with multiple videos posted on social media in the immediate aftermath of the strike.

The Red Crescent said a convoy of five vehicles had been destined for the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, when they were struck multiple times.
One vehicle had been transporting a 35-year-old woman with shrapnel wounds.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “horrified” by the attack in a post on X.
I am horrified by the reported attack in Gaza on an ambulance convoy outside Al Shifa hospital.Now, for nearly one month, civilians in Gaza, including children & women, have been besieged, denied aid, killed & bombed out of their homes.This must stop.— António Guterres (@antonioguterres)November 4, 2023

In response to the bombing, Médecins Sans Frontière (MSF) issued a statement saying:
“The deadly attack outside the gate of Al-Shifa hospital impacting an ambulance is horrendous. This is a lethal attack outside Gaza’s main and busiest hospital, where MSF staff work daily to provide lifesaving medical care.
“We have repeatedly called for an immediate and total ceasefire, for the protection of healthcare facilities, as well as medics, patients and people who are taking shelter there.
“This is a new low in an endless stream of unconscionable violence,” the statement said, describing Israel’s repeated strikes on hospitals, ambulances, densely populated areas and refugee camps as “disgraceful”.
“How many people have to die before world leaders wake up and call for a ceasefire?”
Dr Obaid, an MSF doctor at Al Shifa hospital, said:
“We were standing inside the hospital gate when the ambulance was directly hit in front of us. There were bloody bodies everywhere. Many were killed immediately, while we rushed others to the operating room for emergency care.”
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was “utterly shocked” by the strike.
“We reiterate: patients, health workers, facilities and ambulances must be protected at all times. Always”, he said.
“WHO condemns the attacks on 3 November near Al-Shifa Hospital, Al-Quds Hospital, and the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza City and North Gaza governorates,” a statement from the organisation read.

The Department of Foreign Affairs has confirmed toThe Journalthat no Irish citizens are on the list of people due to depart Gaza through the Rafah crossing today.
“There are an estimated 8000 foreign and dual nationals and immediate dependants in Gaza who are seeking to leave. The evacuations are being managed country by country on a phased basis. It will take some time for this process to be completed,” a spokesperson said.
“Irish citizens are not included in today’s list, but we continue to urgently seek to have Irish citizens included on the list in the coming days,” they said.
“Our Embassies in Cairo and Tel Aviv are in regular communication with the authorities in Egypt and Israel. We also remain in ongoing communication with Irish citizens on the ground.”
Inside Israel, authorities began forcing thousands of Palestinian workers to return to Gaza.
“Thousands of workers who were blocked in Israel since 7 October have been brought back,” the head of Gaza’s crossings authority, Hisham Adwan, told AFP.
The United Nations Human Rights Office said it was “deeply concerned” about the expulsions.
Before the war started, about 18,500 Gazans held Israeli work permits, according to Israeli defence officials, but it was not clear how many were in the country on 7 October.
Today, US secretary of state Antony Blinken held talks in Amman with the foreign ministers of Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
That meeting comes amid mounting Arab anger over the civilian death toll from war, and increasing fears that the conflict could spread.
Jordan’s foreign minister Ayman Safadi said Arab countries seek an immediate ceasefire.
“The whole region is sinking in a sea of hatred that will define generations to come,” Safadi said.
Blinken, however, said “it is our view now that a ceasefire would simply leave Hamas in place, able to regroup and repeat what it did on October 7.”
He said the US believes humanitarian pauses can be a “critical mechanism in protecting civilians, in getting aid in and getting foreign nationals out, while still enabling Israel to achieve its objective, the defeat of Hamas”.

Egyptian officials said they and Qatar were proposing humanitarian pauses for six to 12 hours daily to allow aid in and casualties to be evacuated.
They were also asking for Israel to release a number of women and elderly prisoners in exchange for hostages held by Hamas, suggestions Israel seems unlikely to accept.
They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief the press on the discussions.
Turkey said today it was recalling its ambassador to Israel for consultations due to Israel’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza.
The Turkish foreign ministry said Sakir Ozkan Torunlar was being recalled “in view of the unfolding humanitarian tragedy in Gaza caused by the continuing attacks by Israel against civilians, and Israel’s refusal (to accept) a ceasefire.”

Israel had earlier withdrawn all diplomats from Turkey and other regional countries as a security precaution.
The Israeli foreign ministry said last weekend it was “re-evaluating” relations with Ankara because of Turkey’s increasingly heated rhetoric about the Israel-Hamas war.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said today that Turkey could not afford to entirely break off diplomatic contacts between the sides.
“Completely severing ties is not possible, especially in international diplomacy,” Erdogan said.
He said the country’s MIT intelligence agency chief Ibrahim Kalin was spearheading Turkey’s efforts to try and mediate an end to the war.
“Ibrahim Kalin is talking to the Israeli side. Of course, he is also negotiating with Palestine and Hamas,” Erdogan said.
But he said Netanyahu bore primary responsibility for the violence and had “lost the support of his own citizens”.
“What he needs to do is take a step back and stop this,” Erdogan said.
The leader of Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, Hassan Nasrallah, yesterday broke weeks of silence to warn Israel that the possibility of “total war is realistic”.
Israel’s Netanyahu warned Hezbollah it would “pay an unimaginable price” for any misstep.
Today’s six-nation talks in Amman also touched on the question of Gaza’s future beyond the war.
The United States has renewed calls for the creation of a Palestinian state, but few expect success now after decades of failure and the United State’s consistent backing of Israel.
In Tel Aviv, Blinken said the two-state solution – a Palestinian state that sits alongside Israel – was “best viable path – indeed, the only path” to peace and security for both communities.
Netanyahu has spent decades vehemently opposing that vision.
The United States has also urged the Palestinian Authority, which ceded power to Hamas in Gaza more than 15 years ago, to retake control.
A representative of the Palestinian Authority led by president Mahmud Abbas attended the meeting in Amman.
Thousands of protesters rallied across Iran today against the United States and Israel and in support of Palestinians.
“Down with USA” and “Down with Israel”, chanted demonstrators gathered in front of the former US embassy in Tehran, an AFP journalist reported.
They set ablaze an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu as well as the US and Israel flags in front of flag-waving crowds.
Tensions between Iran and the United States, which were already high, have worsened since the 7 October attacks.

WHO chief 'utterly shocked' as Israel strikes ambulance near hospital in Gaza,"LAST UPDATE|3 Nov 2023

WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was “utterly shocked” by a deadly Israeli strike on an ambulance near Gaza’s largest hospital today.
An AFP journalist saw multiple bodies beside the damaged ambulance outside Gaza City’s Al-Shifa hospital, which in addition to wounded people is overcrowded with civilians seeking shelter from Israeli bombing. The health ministry said 13 people were killed.
The Hamas government said Israeli forces hit “a convoy of ambulances which was transporting the wounded” from Gaza City towards the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.
The Israeli military said it had launched an air strike on “an ambulance that was identified by forces as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell in close proximity to their position in the battle zone”.
Egypt’s health ministry said just 17 wounded Palestinians were evacuated for treatment in Egyptian hospitals today instead of the 28 originally planned because of the “events” at Al-Shifa.
The leader of Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, Hassan Nasrallah, blamed the United States for the conflict as he broke weeks of silence amid concerns of a broader regional conflagration.
“America is entirely responsible for the ongoing war on Gaza and its people, and Israel is simply a tool of execution,” he said in a televised broadcast, accusing Washington of impeding “a ceasefire and the end of the aggression”.

Nasrallah warned Israel against attacking Lebanon and said the possibility of “total war is realistic”.
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Hezbollah “should not try to take advantage of the ongoing conflict”.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Hezbollah it would “pay an unimaginable price” for any misstep.
The fighting was triggered by Hamas’s bloody raids on 7 October, which Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people, mainly civilians.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says more than 9,227 people have died in Israeli bombardments, mostly women and children.
Top US diplomat Antony Blinken left Israel largely empty-handed today after urging its leaders to do more to protect Palestinian civilians in Gaza during their war to destroy Hamas.

On Saturday, he is due to hold talks in neighbouring Jordan with the foreign ministers of five Arab countries who have expressed mounting concern and anger over the civilian death toll from the conflict, now entering its fifth week.

After meeting Netanyahu, Blinken said he had discussed the idea of “humanitarian pauses” to secure the release of hostages and to allow aid to be distributed to Gaza’s beleaguered population.
“We believe that each of these efforts would be facilitated by humanitarian pauses, by arrangements on the ground that increase security for civilians and permit the more effective and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance,” Blinken told journalists.
And he reiterated Washington’s long-standing support for the eventual recognition of a Palestinian state: “Two states for two peoples. Again, that is the only way to ensure lasting security for a Jewish and democratic Israel.”
Netanyahu, however, warned that there could be no “temporary truce” in Gaza unless Hamas releases the estimated 241 Israeli and foreign hostages it took during its 7 October attacks.
Both Israel and the United States have previously ruled out a blanket ceasefire, which they say would allow Hamas to regroup and resupply, but US President Joe Biden has backed “temporary, localised” pauses.
Israel, meanwhile, began expelling thousands of Palestinian workers back to Gaza, despite ongoing fighting and air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians.
Israeli forces have urged Gazans to head south from Gaza City towards the southern end of the territory to escape the worst of the fighting, but the Hamas-run health ministry said that 14 fleeing Palestinians, including women and children, had been killed making this journey.
Witnesses said the strike hit Gaza’s coastal road, which the Israeli military has previously told civilians to take to travel south.
After the Hamas assault, Israeli forces moved to re-establish security on the border, trapping thousands of Palestinian workers inside Israel.
Today, officials began to force them back into Gaza, AFP journalists at the Karem Abu Salem crossing saw.

“Thousands of workers who were blocked in Israel since October 7 have been brought back,” the head of Gaza’s crossings authority, Hisham Adwan, told AFP.
Israel had said it would start sending the workers back to Gaza.
“Israel is severing all contact with Gaza. There will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza,” the Israeli security cabinet said on Thursday.

The United Nations Human Rights Office said it was “deeply concerned” about the expulsions.
“They are being sent back, we don’t know exactly to where,” and whether they “even have a home to go to”, spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told a news conference in Geneva.
Before the war started, some 18,500 Gazans held Israeli work permits, according to Israeli defence officials, but it was not clear how many were in the country on October 7.
Before his departure, Blinken said he would seek to ensure that harm to Palestinian civilians is reduced, in a visible shift of tone for the United States, which has promised full support and ramped-up military aid to Israel.
But, beginning his visit with talks with President Isaac Herzog, Blinken reiterated the basis of its support, telling reporters: “Israel has not only the right but the obligation to defend itself … to make sure that this 7 October never happens again.”
Netanyahu said Israel had already had some “very impressive successes” with troops “more than on the outskirts of Gaza City. We are advancing,” he said late Thursday at a base near Tel Aviv.
Israel’s military describes Gaza City as “the centre of the Hamas terror organisation”.
Although many of the city’s half-a-million residents fled south following Israel’s warning to leave ahead of a ground operation, those who stayed behind have endured weeks of aerial bombardment, dwindling supplies and daily carnage.
But yet more mayhem may lie ahead, as the conflict turns to urban and underground warfare — with Hamas fighting from a tunnel complex believed to span hundreds of kilometres (miles).
The Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, insisted Israeli soldiers would go home “in black bags”.
“Gaza will be the curse of history for Israel,” spokesman Abu Obeida said.
Israel’s allies have backed its right to self-defence, but there is growing global concern and anger at how Israel has chosen to prosecute the war.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar expressed concern that Israel’s response had gone beyond tackling Hamas in self-defence and now “resembles something more approaching revenge”.

Irish father-of-three in Gaza says he and his family are 'trapped in this war',"AN IRISH CITIZEN trapped in Gaza has said Israel is applying “every kind of punishment that you can think of” on the besieged region.
Ibrahim Alagha, his wife, and three children visited Gaza during the summer to see their family and Ibrahim toldThe Journalthat they now find themselves “trapped in this war”.
Speaking toThe Journal, Alagha explained that his father came to Ireland when he was very young.
“He’s a medical doctor and he came to Ireland for his studies and all my siblings were born in Ireland and are Irish citizens,” said Alagha.
“Then there was a war in 2008 in Gaza, and about that time the Irish embassy evacuated all of us.
“I went to Ireland and I completed my Master’s there, found a job, and from there I became an Irish citizen, established my family there and I’m well connected now in Ireland.”
Alagha and his wife both have family in Gaza and he toldThe Journalthat “getting in and out of Gaza has always been very difficult”.
“Our strategy was that we will go less frequently, but whenever we go, we make sure to go as long as possible,” explained Alagha.
“My son Sammy, he’s eight years old, this is only his second time coming here.
“I like to stay here as much as possible so my children would get the culture, the tradition, the language, the connection to the family here.
“I came in July and I was planning to go back around this time of the year, but unfortunately we are trapped in this war.”
When Israel ordered civilians to leave northern Gaza and head for the south, Alagha and his family fled their apartment in Gaza City to move in with his parents in the south of the Gaza Strip, in the city of Khan Yunis.
Alagha toldThe Journalthat his apartment complex in Gaza City has since been targeted in Israeli strikes and “is now completely gone”.
“I’m now staying at my parents’ house in the south,” said Alagha.
“A lot of friends and family, extended family and neighbours, have asked to join us.
“These are all people who have asked to come shelter with us, so we have a huge number of people in our house and it’s a fight to provide water, food and energy.
“It’s a huge challenge every single morning.”
Alagha toldThe Journalthat while the south is “supposed to be the safe place that everyone should go to, that’s not the case.”

He said that on average, 15-20 missiles are striking the area each day.
The health ministry in Gaza today said that an Israeli strike has killed 14 Palestinians who were fleeing from the north to the south.
“The number of people that are dying here is unbelievable and I can’t imagine how much worse it is in the north side of Gaza. It’s a lot worse over there,” said Alagha.
Alagha estimated that the population of Khan Yunis has tripled due to the numbers arriving from the north.
In a statement today, the health ministry in the Gaza Strip said the death toll since the start of Israel’s war against Hamas has reached 9,227.
The ministry said 3,826 children and 2,405 women were among the dead.
Israeli officials said around 1,400 people were killed in Israel when Hamas militants crossed from Gaza and attacked border communities and military posts on 7 October.
Alagha also said that people are “suffering from a lack of medical supplies” and warned that “hospitals are completely collapsing”.
“They ran out of energy,” said Alagha, “and we are experiencing a severe shortage of water and food, power resources. Every kind of punishment that you can think is being applied to us here.”
On Wednesday, Doctors Without Border said that a fuel shortage had resulted in the only public hospital for cancer patients in Gaza being closed.
ActionAid Ireland also warned that two of northern Gaza’s main hospitals, one of which is treating 42 newborn babies in incubators, are hours away from shutting down due to a lack of fuel.
As of Wednesday, 16 out of 35 hospitals in Gaza were out of service due to bombardment or lack of fuel.
Internet and phone communications were cut off completely on two occasions over the past week as Israel bombarded the territory, but have since been restored, though with some intermittent issues.

“Usually, when the communications get cut off completely, that is a sign that Israel is going to intensify its bombing,” Alagha toldThe Journal.
“There’s always this relationship, when everything is cut off you will see that there’s a lot of things going on and a lot of people get killed.
“Those are all results that you will see when the communication is cut off.
“You also have the fear that if anything bad happens to you, you won’t be able to call for help or let people know that you need support.
“So this is a really scary moment when you see communication being cut off.”
During a visit to Rome last month, President Michael D Higgins saidIsrael was reducing humanitarian law to “tatters”and remarked thatIsrael risked falling into the same “category” as Hamaswith its actions.
Today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that some of Israel’s actions in Gaza were“something more approaching revenge”.
Alagha toldThe Journalthat he feels Ireland’s position on the conflict “has always been one of the best in the western world”.
He added: “As a Palestinian living in Ireland, I always feel comfortable. I’d say that’s due to the same struggle that we have, our history and all of that.
“I have friends that live in other parts of Europe and they don’t feel as comfortable as I do in Ireland.
“But the problem is, despite that good position, Ireland is not a big country, it doesn’t have that much influence to change stuff, but a voice in the right direction is better than nothing.”
For the past three days, some foreigners and dual nationals have been able to flee Gaza.
However, no Irish citizens have been included in these groups and the Department of Foreign Affairs today confirmed toThe Journalthat no Irish citizens are included in today’s list.
Image taken today of a damaged building Khan Yunis in southern Gaza, the city where Ibrahim Alagha and his family currently are.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
The spokesperson added: “The evacuations are being managed country by country on a phased basis. It will take some time for this process to be completed.
“Irish citizens are not included in today’s list, but we continue to urgently seek to have Irish citizens included on the list in the coming days.
“Our Embassies in Cairo and Tel Aviv are in regular communication with the authorities in Egypt and Israel. We also remain in ongoing communication with Irish citizens on the ground.”
Alagha said that he is receiving “at least a message a day from the Department of Foreign Affairs”.
“The message just gives an update, and the update is the same content every day – we’re trying, we’re hoping in the very near future (to evacuate you). But it is sent every day and that’s nice.”
There have been calls for a “humanitarian pause” in the conflict to allow aid to more freely enter Gaza.
During a visit to Israel today, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had discussed the potential for a humanitarian pause with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
But Alagha toldThe Journalthat “aid is meaningless if we don’t get fuel”.
“If we have fuel, we will be able to extract our own water, we will be able to generate electricity by generators,” said Alagha.
“Without the fuel, everything is meaningless.”
He explained that he lives close to a wheat mill, where workers have told him that there is a lot of wheat but “no energy for the mill to turn it into the wheat that we cook”.
The Israeli Defence Force today claimed that it has evidence that Hamas is “stealing fuel from Gazan civilians and using it for terror”.
Alagha added that he estimates the total number of aid trucks that have arrived in Gaza since the beginning of the war to be at around 300-400 trucks.
“To put that in context,” said Alagha, “before the war Gaza used to take in around 500-600 trucks of goods per day.
“So you’re talking about the supply of a single day, over the span of a month, that’s nothing.”
He also toldThe Journalthat severe shortages have limited him and his family to a single meal a day.
“You can barely find anything to eat and we don’t have good water,” said Alagha.
“The water that we’re using is extremely bad quality.  It needs filtration but we don’t have resources to filter the water.”

Varadkar says Israel actions ‘more approaching revenge than self-defence’,"LEO VARADKAR HAS said that some of Israel’s actions in Gaza were “something more approaching revenge”.
The Taoiseach reiterated his belief that Israel has a right to defend itself, and to “go after Hamas”, but said what he is “seeing unfolding at the moment isn’t just self-defence”.
He said Israel will not consider Ireland a close friend or ally as it has a different stance on Palestine than most western countries.
“I strongly believe that, like any state, Israel has the right to defend itself, has the right to go after Hamas so that they cannot do this again,” he told Irish media in South Korea.

“But what I’m seeing unfolding at the moment isn’t just self-defence, it looks, resembles, something more approaching revenge.
“That’s not where we should be and I don’t think that’s how Israel will guarantee its future freedom and its future security.”
Varadkar made the comments at the conclusion of a diplomatic mission that he and three ministers were fronting, as part of an Irish “big bang” strategy to improve relations with less-visited countries.
More than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since October 7, when Hamas militants launched rockets, killed 1,400 Israeli citizens and took around 200 hostages to Gaza.
Israel has carried out a military response in the wake of the atrocities; on Friday its troops were engaged in an encirclement of Gaza City in an effort to attack Hamas’s operations in the enclave it rules.
Aid agencies are now battling a humanitarian crisis in Gaza with limited resources.

Meanwhile, some dual nationals and injured citizens have been able to leave the war-ravaged region through Egypt’s Rafah crossing this week; around 35 Irish passport-holders remain in the territory.
On Thursday, Ireland’s president said that “collective punishment” cannot be accepted and there must be a push for verified facts in relation to the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Michael D Higgins said that those who want to uphold international law “must press for an independent verification of the facts”, and that lives lost should “not reduced to competing press releases”.
Higgins said that if international law is to be upheld, the hostages should be released and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire should come into effect.","11.19am, 3 Nov 2023",Pro-Palestine, Critiques Israeli military actions as excessive and not justifiable as self-defense.
Higgins says 'collective punishment' is not something world can accept in Israel-Gaza war,"PRESIDENT MICHAEL D Higgins has said “collective punishment is not something we can accept” in the conflict in the Middle East.
He called for finding a “space for diplomacy” to deliver “reasonable security” to Israel and at the same time deliver for the “long-neglected rights” of the Palestinians.
In a fresh statement on the war, Higgins spoke of the need for “verification about facts” around the conflict, as well as warning against the “enlistment of civilians for military purposes” which he said needed to be recognised and addressed.
It is the first time the president’s office has issued a statement about the war. Previously, he addressed questions from reporters on aspects of the conflict, including calling the blast at the al-Ahli Hospital in Northern Gaza to beinvestigated as a war crime.
In the statement, Higgins repeated calls for a ceasefire, the removal of “all blocks to humanitarian relief” and expressed dismay over the “horrific loss” of civilian life in Gaza and Israel.
“If we are to move past the present events, we need the capacity to verify what are the facts on the ground and to respond to them,” Higgins said.
Touching on the European Union, Higgins warned that any international bodies who may “remain silent or allow their messages to have ambiguous construction”, and reminded them of a “responsibility to commit to vindicating international law” in its response to the war in Gaza and Israel.

The president also criticised “violence by non-State as well as State actors”, adding: [They] must be described for what it is – breaches of international humanitarian law.”
Regarding the enlistment of civilians for military aims, he said this occurrence “on any side” has to be addressed.
“It is simply unacceptable that hospitals and those being cared for within them are threatened by the basic lack of resources, damaged or indeed threated with destruction, or those within them forced to be evacuated,” Higgins said.
He said: “In this terrible ongoing loss of civilian life, that is having such a devastating impact on families on all sides, with the large proportion of those killed being women and children, it is important that there be a verification of figures, that the lives lost are not reduced to competing press releases.”
Higgins added: “Those in the international community who are anxious to support international law, see it vindicated in its fullest sense, including the Geneva Convention, must press for an independent verification of the facts.”
Protection of children
The president that no other issues “should stand in the way for even a minute” When it comes to the protection of children.
He added that he is proud of Irish NGOs who are responding to the “present horror” that is unfolding in Gaza, praising their courage and humanity in the worst of circumstances.
“One can only admire the extraordinary courage and commitment of the medical personnel who, while enduring unimaginable difficulties, are staying with those for whom they care, putting their own lives at risk,” Higgins continued.
“That so many members of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), including teachers, have already lost their lives in that task illustrates the terrible price that threatening civilians with terror, war and its response delivers.”

"Israeli army says Gaza City completely encircled as Palestinian death toll passes 9,000","LAST UPDATE|2 Nov 2023
ISRAEL’S ARMY HAS said it has encircled Gaza City following days of expanding ground operations and heavy bombardment in the besieged territory.
“Israeli soldiers have completed the encirclement of the city of Gaza, the centre of the Hamas terror organisation,” military spokesman Daniel Hagari told journalists.
Shortly afterwards, Hamas’s military wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said that Gaza would be a “curse” for Israel and that its invading soldiers would go home “in black bags”.
The Gaza conflict raged for a 27th day today after the 7 October attacks when Hamas militants stormed the border, killing 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 240 others, according to Israeli officials.
Since then, Israel has relentlessly bombarded the Palestinian territory and sent in ground troops, with the health ministry in Gaza saying 9,061 people have been killed, including 3,760 children.
Hundreds more foreigners and dual nationals fled war-torn Gaza for Egypt today as Israeli forces bombarded and fought ground battles in the besieged Palestinian territory, where thousands have died.
Egypt said it eventually plans to help evacuate 7,000 foreigners through the Rafah crossing and a spokesman for the Palestinian side of the border post said about 100 had been able to leave today.
A total of 400 foreign passport holders as well as 60 severely wounded Palestinians in ambulances were due to cross by the end of the second day of departures, Wael Abu Mohsen said, and Egyptian officials later reported the first arrivals.
A list of those approved to travel today shows hundreds of US citizens and 50 Belgians along with smaller numbers from various European, Arab, Asian and African countries.
Yesterday, Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Micheál Martin said the government had not been notified of any Irish passport holders leaving Gaza through the Rafah crossing into Egypt.
Irish citizenswill not be included in today’s groupof dual nationals leaving Gaza for Egypt today either.
There are around 40 Irish passport holders in Gaza but the Department of Foreign Affairs has not been notified of any of these persons being included in today’s crossing.
Minister for Trade Promotion Dara Calleary today said the Department of Foreign Affairs is “working incredibly hard” to get Irish passport-holders out of Gaza.
He said the department is in regular contact with each of the people on the list of Irish passport holders they are aware of in the region.
Speaking to RTÉ radio, Calleary said: “I have to reiterate if there’s anybody – or anybody that has connections – in Gaza that haven’t registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs, please register.”
He added: “They’re throwing everything at it. It is a very complex situation. It is only today that people are beginning to get out and I think everything is being done to ensure that we get Irish passport holders out.”

Earlier today, a Sinn Féin delegation led by party leader Mary Lou McDonald and including deputy leader Michelle O’Neill and Foreign Affairs spokesperson Matt Carthy met with ambassadors and diplomatic representatives from Palestine, Egypt, Alergia, Morocco, the UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
“The ambassadors briefed us on the deteriorating situation in Gaza where the Israeli bombardment is causing a humanitarian crisis with almost 10,000 Palestinians killed, many of whom are children, the displacement of 1.4 million people and the cutting off of humanitarian aid,” McDonald said following the meeting.
“Israel’s actions are not defence. They amount to collective punishment and are a breach of international law,” she said.
McDonald said that the international community and the EU “are failing to provide the leadership required”.
“They need to be unequivocal in calling for an immediate ceasefire, be unequivocal and consistent in the application of international law and be unequivocal in holding Israel to account for its continuous breaching of international law,” she said.

“And ultimately there must be dialogue to secure a just and lasting peace including a viable State of Palestine.”
Yesterday and today’s evacuations mark a tiny proportion of the 2.4 million people trapped in Gaza under weeks bombardment since Hamas launched their bloody cross-border attack into Israel on 7 October.
Ground battles flared again overnight in northern Gaza as Israeli troops have sought to destroy Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the territory.
Hamas’ assault on 7 October, which Israel says claimed 1,400 lives, was the bloodiest in the country’s 75-year-history.
The Israeli army is also seeking to free around 240 hostages, both civilians and troops, captured by Hamas during the attacks.
Seperately, it’s also been reported by Iran’s Islamic Republican News Agency that an Irish citizen is being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.
These unconfirmed reports have not been backed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, with Calleary telling RTÉ that he “does not have precise information” on this and that he wasn’t able to confirm these reports.
Today, the Israeli military said it had killed dozens of enemy fighters.
“IDF fighters continue to advance in the Gaza City area and conduct face-to-face battles with Hamas terrorists and to deepen the fighting,” military spokesman Daniel Hagari told journalists.
“At the end of a battle that lasted several hours and included ground fighting and fire support from aircraft and a missile ship, many terrorists were killed.”
Some 332 soldiers have already died in the 7 October attacks and in the Israeli offensive the Hamas assault triggered.
Now gruelling urban warfare lies ahead deeper inside Gaza, where Hamas is fighting from a tunnel network spanning hundreds of kilometres.

Global concern has risen sharply over Israel’s response, in which the army says it has struck more than 12,000 targets so far.
Special concern has focused on repeated heavy strikes on Gaza’s largest refugee camp – densely populated Jabalia, north of Gaza City – where explosions brought down residential buildings.
Gaza’s Hamas-ruled government said 195 were killed in two days of Israeli strikes on Jabalia, with hundreds more missing and wounded, figures AFP could not independently verify.
Hamas said seven of the estimated 242 hostages it is holding, died in Tuesday’s bombings, a claim that was also impossible to verify.
Major strikes also hit Gaza’s Bureij refugee camp and an area near a UN-run school, where the health ministry said 27 had died.
Outside the Al-Quds hospital in Gaza City, displaced residents seeking shelter from Israeli strikes told AFP that civilians would not withstand the barrage much longer.
“This is not a life. We need a safe place for our kids,” said 50-year-old Hiyam Shamlakh. “Everybody is terrified, children, women and the elderly.”
Talal Shamlakh, 65, said: “There have been missiles since 7:00am around the hospital and we couldn’t sleep while children are screaming.”
Another Gazan, Mahmoud Abu Jarad, said civilians would not be able to tolerate another week of strikes. “We demand a ceasefire. This is the most important thing,” the 30-year-old said.
Israel has sought to justify the first Jabalia attack by saying it had targeted a senior Hamas commander in a tunnel complex below the camp.
AFP has witnessed rescuers desperately clawing through the rubble and twisted metal in frantic attempts to bring out survivors and bodies.

Emergency responders say “whole families” have died.
The wounded were rushed away by cart, motorcycle and ambulance as anguished wails and blaring sirens filled the dusty air.
But Gaza’s hospitals have been overwhelmed and run short of medical supplies and even electricity.

Tensions and violence have also spread in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where more than 130 Palestinians have died since 7 October according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Three Palestinians were killed today by Israeli fire in the West Bank, the ministry said, and an Israeli was killed in a Palestinian shooting attack, according to first responders.

In embattled Gaza, more than 20,000 people have been wounded, according to aid group Doctors Without Borders.
Israel has argued it is trying to avoid civilian casualties and has told residents to evacuate northern Gaza. It also says Hamas has blocked many civilians from leaving to use them as “human shields”.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is leaving on another trip to the Middle East as he renews support for Israel but also reportedly seeks to encourage the US ally to limit the civilian deaths that have outraged much of the world.
Blinken will spend the day tomorrow in Israel – his fourth visit since the 7 October  Hamas assault, including a trip to accompany President Joe Biden – and also head to Jordan and potentially other stops before a previously scheduled trip to Asia.
The United States is the foremost supporter of Israel and has promised to ramp up military assistance as Israel wages a retaliatory campaign against Hamas, even as a rising number of US allies accuse it of a disproportionate response.
Yesterday Biden said he supported a humanitarian “pause” in the Gaza conflict, but the United States remains opposed to calls for a ceasefire, saying that Hamas has no intention of holding fire.
Blinken is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had rocky relations with Biden before the war over his hard-right policies.
While publicly supporting Israel, the Biden administration has been openly critical of the lack of action in the West Bank against Israeli settlers who have attacked Palestinians.
US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller called the violence “incredibly destabilising.”
“We have sent a very clear message to them that it’s unacceptable, it needs to stop and those responsible for it need to be held accountable,” Miller said yesterday of US contact with the Israeli government.
The talks in Israel are also expected to start discussions on what comes next after the war.
Testifying before Congress earlier this week, Blinken said that the Palestinian Authority — which Netanyahu’s hard-right government has sought to degrade – should eventually take over in the Gaza Strip after the elimination of Hamas.
“Whether you can get there in one step is a big question that we have to look at. And if you can’t, then there are other temporary arrangements that may involve a number of other countries in the region,” he said.
“It may involve international agencies that would help provide for both security and governance.”

For the price of one cup of coffee each week you can make sure we can keep reliable, meaningful news open to everyone regardless of their ability to pay.","6.59am, 2 Nov 2023",Pro-Palestine," Describes the extensive impact of Israeli military operations on Gaza, emphasizing the high death toll."
'A scale of death unknown this century': Over 30 journalists killed in Israel-Hamas war to date,"MORE THAN 30 journalists have been killed since the Israel-Hamas war began on 7 October – making it the deadliest start to a conflict in terms of journalists’ deaths so far in the 21st century.
According to a tally by Reporters Without Borders, also known by its French name Reporters sans frontières (RSF), 34 journalists have been killed since the start of the war last month.
Of these people, at least 12 were killed in the course of their work – 10 in Gaza, one in Israel and one in Lebanon. Several other journalists have been injured or are missing.
Overall, more than 9,000 people have died in Palestine, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. More than 1,400 people have been killed in Israel – the majority in the initial days of the war.
On Tuesday the RSF fileda complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC) over alleged war crimes committed against journalists in recent weeks.
Christophe Deloire, RSF Secretary General, said more journalists have been killed in the course of their work in recent weeks in the Middle East than in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February 2022.
“Since 2000, we have not seen a war begin with so much violence against journalists. Israel’s attack on Gaza in response to the massacre committed by Hamas will go down in the history books and in the annals of journalism as one of the cruellest episodes for reporters, as well as for all other civilians,” Deloire said.
“We call on the Israeli authorities to end the bombardments, which amount to war crimes. This disastrous toll adds a new blood-coloured stain to an already tragic story.
“More journalists have been killed in the course of their work in two weeks in the Middle East than in Ukraine since February 2022 as a result of the Russian invasion. This is the sad reality of a grim toll,” he added.
Comparison to other wars
The number of journalists killed in the course of their work in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in recent weeks exceeds the total of 11 killed in connection with their work since the war began in Ukraine, seven of whom were killed during the first month after Russia launched its invasion, RSF said.
The death toll also exceeds the number of reporters killed during the first 20 days of the war in Iraq in 2003, and those killed in Afghanistan in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 in 2001, according to RSF.
To date in the 21st century, long-running wars in Iraq and Syria have seen the highest number of fatalities for journalists overall – with300 and 282 deaths reported respectively.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) last week told international news organisations Reuters and Agence France Presse it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists working in the Gaza Strip, after the outlets had sought assurances that reporters would not be targeted.
In a letter sent to the two news outlets, the IDF said it is “targeting all Hamas military activity throughout Gaza”, adding that Hamas deliberately puts military operations “in the vicinity of journalists and civilians”.
“Under these circumstances, we cannot guarantee your employees’ safety, and strongly urge you to take all necessary measures for their safety,” the IDF letter concluded.
Many journalists’ relatives have also been killed in recent weeks. The wife, son, daughter and grandson of Wael al-Dahdouh, Al Jazeera’s bureau chief in Gaza, were killed inan Israeli air raidon the Nuseirat refugee camp.
Complaint to the ICC
The RSF complaint, which was filed with the office of the ICC prosecutor on 31 October, concerns eight Palestinian journalists who were killed in bombardments of civilian areas in Gaza by Israel, and an Israeli journalist who was killed on 7 October while covering an attack on his kibbutz by Hamas.
The complaint also refers to two other journalists who were wounded in the course of their work. It cites the deliberate, total or partial, destruction of the premises of more than 50 media outlets in Gaza.
This is RSF’s third complaint to the ICC prosecutor about alleged war crimes against Palestinian journalists in Gaza since 2018.
Deloire said the “scale, seriousness and recurring nature of international crimes targeting journalists, particularly in Gaza, calls for a priority investigation by the ICC prosecutor”.
“We have been calling for this since 2018. The current tragic events demonstrate the extreme urgency of the need for ICC action,” he added.

In a statement, the RSF said the attacks suffered by Palestinian journalists in Gaza “correspond to the international humanitarian law definition of an indiscriminate attack and therefore constitute war crimes under Article 8.2.b. of the Rome Statute”.
“Even if these journalists were the victims of attacks aimed at legitimate military targets, as the Israeli authorities claim, the attacks nevertheless caused manifestly excessive and disproportionate harm to civilians, and still amount to a war crime under this article,” the statement noted.
The Rome Statute is the treaty that established the ICC. It was adopted in Rome on 17 July 1998 and came into effect on 1 July 2002.
Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction on the basis that it believes Palestine is not a sovereign state capable of being a party to the Rome Statute.
However, the ICC recently told Reuters it hasjurisdiction over potential war crimescarried out by Hamas militants in Israel and Israelis in the Gaza Strip, even though Israel is not a member state.
Names of those killed
Separately, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an independent, nonprofit organisation which promotes press freedom worldwide, has reported that 33 journalists have been killed since the war began.

No Irish citizens to be included in group of evacuees leaving Gaza for Egypt today,"IRISH CITIZENS WILL not be included in a group of dual nationals leaving Gaza for Egypt today through the Rafah border crossing.
The Rafah border crossing opened yesterday to allow foreigners and dual nationals to flee the besieged region.
It was the first time Egypt has opened the Rafah crossing since the Israel-Hamas war began on 7 October.
The crossing point will re-open today for foreign passport holders and wounded Palestinians.
Seventy-six wounded Palestinians and 335 foreigners or dual-nationals were allowed to cross from the war-torn Gaza Strip for Egypt yesterdaybut no Irish citizens were included.
Wael Abu Mohsen, spokesman for the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, said in a statement that “100 travellers of foreign nationalities” had crossed into Egypt this morning and that 400 foreign passport holders, as well as 60 wounded patients, were due to cross by the day’s end.
There are around 40 Irish passport holders in Gaza but the Department of Foreign Affairs has not been notified of any of these persons being included in today’s crossing.
Minister for Trade Promotion Dara Calleary today said the Department of Foreign Affairs is “working incredibly hard” to get Irish passport-holders out of Gaza.
He said the department is in regular contact with each of the people on the list of Irish passport holders they are aware of in the region.
Speaking to RTÉ radio, Calleary said: “I have to reiterate if there’s anybody – or anybody that has connections – in Gaza that haven’t registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs, please register.”
He added: “They’re throwing everything at it. It is a very complex situation. It is only today that people are beginning to get out and I think everything is being done to ensure that we get Irish passport holders out.”

Seperately, it’s also been reported by Iran’s Islamic Republican News Agency that an Irish citizen is being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.
These unconfirmed reports have not been backed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, with Calleary telling RTÉ that he “does not have precise information” on this and that he wasn’t able to confirm these reports.
However, he added: “If the Department and Tánaiste are aware of this, I have absolutely no doubt that they are doing their best to get that person released.
“It’s an appalling situation and I have no doubt that they are throwing everything at it to try to resolve this quickly.”
The Department of Foreign Affairs has said it does not comment on individual cases.
Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has told reporters in South Korea that he hasn’t been briefed on any reports of an Irish citizen being held hostage by Hamas.
Varadkar is in South Korea on a trade mission.
Varadkar told RTÉ: “The Tánaiste has had a phone call with the Iranian Foreign Minister.
“I was given a read out on that but not that particular detail. That is not to say it is not the case.
He added: “The Tánaiste made a number of phone calls to counterparts in the region to hear their assessment of the situation and explore what could be done.
“I wasn’t on the phone call. I haven’t been briefed on anything in relation to an Irish citizen being kidnapped by Hamas.”

"UN says Israeli strikes on Gaza refugee camp, the second in two days, could be war crimes","
DEADLY ISRAELI AIR strikes on the Gaza Strip’s largest refugee camp “could amount to war crimes”, the UN Human Rights Office said today.
Israeli strikes have targeted the Jabalia refugee camp twice in two days, killing and wounding dozens, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.
Israel said yesterday’s raid was a successful hit on top Hamas commander Ibrahim Biari.
“Given the high number of civilian casualties & the scale of destruction following Israeli air strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes,” the office wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
Israel has relentlessly pounded Gaza in retribution for the worst attack in the country’s history.
Hamas gunmen stormed across the border from Gaza on 7 October, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 230 hostages, according to Israeli officials.
Israel’s retaliatory bombing campaign has killed 8,796 people, mainly women and children, according to Hamas-run Gaza’s health ministry.

The principle of proportionality referred to by the UN plays a central role in the wars of law defined by the Geneva Conventions.
Civilians and civilian structures must be spared – but the death of civilians during a conflict does not necessarily constitute a war crime.
Warring parties can launch attacks deemed proportionate on military targets even while knowing that civilians could also be hit.
A crime is committed when an attack is deliberately carried out against civilians, or if the scale of the damage to civilians is excessive compared to the military advantage.
The International Criminal Court is the only independent international legal authority that carries out investigations into genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, but Israel is not a member.

Images from today’s strike on the camp showed extensive damage and rescuers clawing through rubble to extract blood-stained casualties.
The large death toll from the strikes has drawn a chorus of international condemnation, with Bolivia severing diplomatic ties with Israel in protest.
A spokesperson for UN chief Antonio Guterres said he is “appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza, including the killing of Palestinians, including women and children in Israeli air strikes in residential areas of the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp”.
The French government has said it is “deeply concerned” about Israeli strikes on the refugee camp.

“France is deeply concerned about the very heavy toll on the Palestinian civilian population from the Israeli strikes against the Jabalia camp, and expresses its compassion for the victims,” the government said in a press release.
Paris reiterated a call for “an immediate humanitarian truce so that aid can reach those who need it in a sustainable, safe and adequate way”.
Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel “to condemn the Israeli war that is killing innocent people in Gaza”.
The last time Jordan recalled its ambassador to Israel was in 2019.
An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said the country “regrets the decision of the Jordanian government to recall its ambassador”.
Since the war began, Jordan has seen several large protests in support of Gaza, with demonstrators demanding that it annul the peace treaty with Israel and close the Israeli embassy.
Yesterday, US President Joe Biden spoke with Jordan’s King Abdullah II, a key US partner, with the two discussing “urgent mechanisms to stem violence, calm rhetoric and reduce regional tensions”, the White House said.
Biden and King Abdullah “discussed urgent mechanisms to stem violence, calm rhetoric, and reduce regional tensions”, and agreed it was “critical to ensure that Palestinians are not forcibly displaced outside of Gaza”, a White House statement said.

Hamas said seven of the 240 hostages it is holding, including three foreign passport holders, died in yesterday’s bombing, a claim impossible to verify.
The group’s leader Ismail Haniyeh accused Israel of committing “barbaric massacres against unarmed civilians”, saying it was covering its own “defeats”.
Meanwhile, hundreds of injured residents and foreigners escaped Gaza to Egypt today, the first evacuations from the war-torn Palestinian territory pounded by Israeli warplanes in retaliation for an unprecedented Hamas attack.
AFP reporters at Gaza’s southern border saw ambulances whisking away the wounded to Egyptian field hospitals, including one young boy with heavy bandaging around his stomach.
Whole families, struggling to carry their worldly possessions, rushed through the heavily fortified crossing towards Egypt, which said it had admitted 335 foreigners or dual nationals and 76 seriously wounded and sick people.
The foreigners included 31 Austrians, five French nationals, four Italians, and some German and US citizens, their governments said.
Jordanian citizen Umm Saleh Hussein said water and electricity shortages were “the least” of the hardships Gazans were facing.
“There were bigger problems such as the bombardment. We were afraid. Many families were martyred,” she told AFP.
A group of mostly women and children were the first to arrive in Egypt, with TV images showing parents with pushchairs and elderly people clambering off a bus.

“It’s enough. We’ve endured enough humiliation,” said Gaza resident Rafik al-Hilou, accompanying relatives including children aged one and four hoping to enter Egypt.

“We lack the most basic human needs. No internet, no phones, no means of communication, not even water. For the past four days, we haven’t been able to feed this child a piece of bread. What are you waiting for?”
The situation in Gaza remained desperate, with food, fuel and medicine for the 2.4 million residents all running short, according to aid groups.
The fuel shortage and damage due to air strikes meant “the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, the main cancer centre in the Gaza Strip, is no longer functional”, the World Health Organization said on X.
A Gaza official said about 50 trucks carrying medical and food aid entered Gaza today, among the biggest daily flows so far, but far fewer than humanitarian groups say is needed.
Palestinian residents told AFP they had evacuated from northern Gaza, as demanded by Israel, but were still under threat.
“We’ve been told people are evacuating from Gaza City towards the central area of the strip beyond the valley, so we headed there,” Amen al-Aqluk said.
“After 20 days, we were bombarded. Three of our kids lost their lives and we all got injured.
“There is no hope in the Gaza Strip. It is not safe any more here. When the border opens, everybody will leave and emigrate. We encounter death every day, 24 hours a day.”
The head of the UN agency that works to help Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, managed to reach Gaza today via the Rafah border crossing.
“I was shocked by the fact that everyone there was asking for food, was asking for water,” Lazzarini, the most senior UN official allowed into the besieged territory since the war began, told journalists in Gaza.
With fears mounting of a regional war, Biden called for “urgent mechanisms” to dial down tensions and said top diplomat Antony Blinken would embark on another Middle East tour from Friday.
Turkey and Iran called for a regional conference to prevent a conflagration, as Israel faces a daily barrage of aerial attacks from Hamas and other Iran-backed groups around the Middle East, including Yemen’s Huthi rebels.
In the north, Israel has traded near-daily fire with Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.
And the families of hostages kidnapped by Hamas have endured an unbearable wait for news of relatives thought to be held in the labyrinth of tunnels deep below Gaza.
Ayelet Sella, whose seven cousins were kidnapped by Hamas, said she could find “no rest” until her loved ones are returned.
“We have no more tears, our eyes are dry, we are empty three weeks on,” Sella told AFP at the Great Synagogue in Paris. “I only ask for one thing, that they come back.”

It’s a living hell for everyone else,” said children’s aid agency UNICEF, urging an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”.“The more than one million children of Gaza also have a water crisis. Gaza’s water production capacity is a mere 5% of its usual daily output. Child deaths – particularly infants – to dehydration are a growing threat,” the spokesperson said.They added: “And there there is the trauma. When the fighting stops, the cost to children and their communities will be borne out for generations to come.”Surgeons are conducting amputations on hospital floors without anaesthetic, and children are forced to drink salty water, said Jean-Francois Corty, vice-president of Medecins du Monde, which has 20 staff on the ground.Israeli officials said 70 trucks with aid were allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt yesterday, one of the biggest flows since a US-brokered deal was reached, but much less than humanitarian groups say is needed.Fearing supplies entering Gaza could be diverted to Hamas, or that aid shipments could conceal arms or other supplies, Israel’s security personnel carry out stringent inspections that have slowed the flow of aid to a trickle.1 Nov 202311:18AMThe Palestinian telecommunications agency said earlier today that phone and internet services had “been completely cut off in Gaza”, the second such blackout in a week.1 Nov 202311:23AMThe Department of Foreign Affairs has said it is aware the Rafah border crossing is open today for seriously injured people and some foreign nationals.It said it has “not been notified of any Irish citizens included in this first group, but are urgently seeking to have Irish people included in subsequent evacuations”.“Our Embassies in Cairo and Tel Aviv are in constant communication with the authorities in Egypt and Israel about Irish people stuck in Gaza,” the Department said.“The Department is also in regular communication with Irish citizens on the ground, although there are ongoing communication challanges. We are updating citizens directly as we have confirmed information.”1 Nov 202311:28AMAl Jazeera is reporting that there has been another attack on the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza. This is the same camp that was struck yesterday.Its reporter Wael Dahdouh has said an Israeli air raid targeted a residential block in the al-Falouja area.He reported that buildings have been leveled and the camp was targeted by Israeli warplanes and intense, indiscriminate shelling.The news outlet is reporting that hundreds of people are feared to be trapped and buried under the rubble. Israel earlier reportedly dropped leaflets telling Palestinians to leave.As we reported earlier, the Palestinian telecommunications agency has said that phone and internet services have “been completely cut off in Gaza”.Al Jazeera has said it is trying to contact sources and relatives in Jabalia “but because of the communications blackout we cannot get more information at this time”.More as we get it.Palestinians searching for survivors following yesterday's Israeli airstrike in the Jabalia refugee camp north of Gaza CityAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo1 Nov 202311:29AMThe health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip has said today that8,796 peoplehave been killed since the war with Israel erupted on 7 October.The death toll includes 3,648 children while 22,219 people have been wounded, a health ministry statement said.1 Nov 202311:37AMAn NGO defending press freedom has filed a complaint alleging war crimes with the International Criminal Court (ICC) over the death of journalists in the Israel-Hamas war.Reporters Without Borders, known by its French acronym RSF, said its complaint concerned “war crimes committed against Palestinian journalists in Gaza” and “against an Israeli journalist”.Specifically, the complaint concerned “eight Palestinian journalists who were killed in bombardments of civilian areas in Gaza by Israel, and an Israeli journalist who was killed on October 7 while covering an attack on his kibbutz by Hamas”, the organisation said in a statement.“It also cites the deliberate, total or partial, destruction of the premises of more than 50 media outlets in Gaza,” it said.“The attacks suffered by Palestinian journalists in Gaza correspond to the international humanitarian law definition of an indiscriminate attack and therefore constitute war crimes,” it said, while the Israeli journalist’s death constituted “the intentional homicide of a person protected by the Geneva Conventions, which is a war crime”.🔴RSF files complaint with ICC for war crimes against journalists in#Palestine&#Israel.

Fathers talking about losing their children.“It’s horrific, it’s not justifiable and in our view, it adds pressure to the need to have a humanitarian pause here, a humanitarian ceasefire to allow aid to get in,” he said.The Tánaiste said Israel has the right to “go after Hamas” but said there is an “issue of proportionality” because when you bomb a refugee camp there is “no doubt” many civilians will die.“The pressure is so great on the civilian population now and the United Nations agencies are saying to us that this is a human catastrophe happening before our very eyes that it demands a pause in the initial phase. Nobody is saying thatIsrael does not have a right to go after Hamas after the murder of so many Israeli civilians,” Martin said.He added that there is a moral question and a legal question when it comes to the targets chosen by Israel.“In my view, what is Israel saying that if we take out a commander of Hamas and some underground tunnels that that’s worth so many hundred lives, is that the moral question that is being put before us? I’m very clear on what side I’m on that you cannot knowingly take out hundreds of civilians that are not Hamas because of the cowardly and unacceptable and illegal use of civilians as human shields,” Martin said.1 Nov 202312:31PMThe first group of foreigners and dual nationals fleeing Gaza have now arrived in Egypt, according to an Egyptian official.The group mostly consists of women, children and elderly people, who were seen among those getting off a bus on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing.Earlier, ambulances were seen carrying wounded Palestinians who have fled across the border.1 Nov 202312:43PMCommunicationsThe Palestinian telecoms company Paltel has said internet and mobile phone services are gradually being restored in Gaza following a “complete disruption”, which was also reported by internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org.It marked the second time residents were largely cut off after communications went down over the weekend while Israeli troops pushed into Gaza.The International Committee of the Red Cross said communication blackouts disrupt the work of first responders and make it harder for civilians to seek safety.“Even the potentially life-saving act of calling an ambulance becomes impossible,” said spokeswoman Jessica Moussan.1 Nov 202312:58PMSome of the first evacuees crossing into Egypt have shared details of their experience with media on the ground.“It’s enough. We’ve endured enough humiliation,” Gaza resident Rafik al-Hilou said, speaking to AFP.“We lack the most basic human needs. No internet, no phones, no means of communication, not even water. For the past four days, we haven’t been able to feed this child a piece of bread. What are you waiting for?”Jordanian citizen Saleh Hussein said she received word in the middle of the night that she was on the list for evacuation.“We’ve faced many problems in Gaza, the least of which were the shortage of water and the power outage. There were bigger problems such as the bombardment. We were afraid. Many families were martyred,” she said.1 Nov 20231:07PMThe EU’s highest security official Josep Borrell has stated he is “appalled” by the casualities caused by Israel’s bombing of the Jabalia refugee camps, adding that international humanitarian law “cannot be applied selectively”.“Building on EU Council’s clear stance that Israel has the right to defend itself in line with international humanitarian law and ensuring the protection of all civilians, I am appalled by the high number of casualties following the bombing by Israel of the Jabalia refugee camp,” Borrell wrote on X this morning.“United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres reminded that IHL cannot be applied selectively, including the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution,” he said.“The right to self-defence should always be balanced by the obligation to spare civilians to the greatest extent possible.“Laws of war and humanity must always apply, including when it comes to humanitarian assistance.”With each passing day, as the situation becomes more and more dire, this is more urgent than ever.The safety and the protection of civilians is not only a moral, but a legal obligation.— Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF)November 1, 20231 Nov 20231:25PMAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock PhotoScottish First Minister Humza Yousaf has welcomed the opening of the Rafah crossing to allow people to leave the Gaza Strip, but his in-laws remain trapped with “dwindling supplies”, a spokesman has said.Yousaf’s parents-in-law Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla, from Dundee, travelled to Gaza to visit family before the conflict erupted and are now trapped there.In a statement, the spokesman said: “We welcome that the Rafah crossing looks set to be opened for a number of foreign nationals.“This is obviously a developing situation, but our understanding at this stage is that UK nationals are not at present included in this initial list of countries whose nationals can cross.“The First Minister has been in contact with the Foreign Secretary this morning.“We continue to liaise with the UK Government and urge them to work with the Egyptian authorities so that all UK nationals can urgently leave Gaza as quickly as possible.“The First Minister’s wife, Nadia, spoke to her mother this morning.

Egypt announced that the most badly wounded, foreigners, and dual nationals could flee Gaza, which has suffered weeks of relentless bombardment by Israel.
“We are overwhelmed … Have mercy on us. We are Egyptians and can’t cross into our country,” Umm Yussef, a dual Palestinian-Egyptian national, told AFP on the Gaza side.
“Let us in. We are exhausted. We can’t sleep or eat.”

Here’s a quick recap on yesterday’s developments in Gaza.
A strike on Gaza’s largest refugee camp killed at least 47 people yesterday – including a Hamas commander involved in the 7 October attacks, according to Israel.
A large explosion ripped through the densely packed Jabalia camp before nightfall, tearing facades off nearby buildings and leaving a deep, debris-littered crater.
AFP witnessed at least 47 corpses being recovered.
Israel said its warplanes had struck a “vast” tunnel complex at the site, killing “many Hamas terrorists”, including local battalion commander Ibrahim Biari.
Hamas said today that seven hostages from its 7 October attacks, including three foreign passport holders, were killed in the bombing.
“Seven detainees were killed in the Jabalia massacre yesterday, including three holders of foreign passports,” said a Hamas military wing statement.
No details were given and it was not possible to independently verify the claim.

AFP reporters said they have seen a phalanx of 40 white ambulances streaming through the Rafah border crossing, as crowds of foreign and dual national families gathered nearby, hoping to leave the catastrophic conditions of Gaza behind them.
At least two children were seen in the ambulances, one with a large bandage wrapped around his stomach, as medics examined the wounded and transferred them to stretchers.
The UK’s Foreign Office has said it understands the Rafah crossing will be “open for controlled and time-limited periods to allow specific groups of foreign nationals and the seriously wounded to leave”.
“It is therefore likely the departure of British nationals from Gaza will take place in stages over the coming days,” it said.

The director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has welcomed Eygpt’s decision “to accept some injured and sick people from Gaza for treatment”.
“We have been working with Egypt’s health ministry on planning for medical evacuations and will continue to support,” he said.
He added that “attention must not be diverted from the far greater needs of thousands of patients in Gaza, many of them extremely fragile who cannot be moved”.
“We need an immediate acceleration in the flow of medical aid permitted into Gaza. Hospitals must be protected from bombardment and military use.”

Debunked: Photo of ‘corpse’ using phone isn't from Gaza; it actually shows a Halloween costume,"
A PHOTO THAT depicts a person wrapped in a shroud like a corpse, but who can be seen using their phone, has been shared thousands of times with captions that suggest death tolls from Gaza are unreliable.
However, the photo has no connection with Gaza; it was taken in Thailand and shows a child’s Halloween costume.
“When the ‘Gaza Ministry of Health’ tells you how many casualties there are…” a number of posts – including on Irish accounts – sharing the image on the social media platforms X and Facebook say, implying deaths in Gaza are fabricated.
One such post has been viewed more than 619,500 times, according to X’s statistics.
“One of Gaza’s crisis actors got bored pretending to be a dead child killed by Israel”, another post on X, viewed more than 21,000 times says.
“Side note- isn’t it incredible how many days his phone battery is lasting? Considering Gaza claims to be without electricity.”

An image falsely said to show hoax casualties in the Israel-Gaza conflict.
Atop the image, a Hebrew logo can be seen for an “official channel”, however the name of the channel is cut-off.
However, the image is not from Gaza, but was shared online before the recent series of attacks in Israel and Gaza. The photo was traced back to Halloween celebrations in Thailand last year.
The Indian outlet NewsMobile was able tosource the photoback to Facebook posts that hadgone viralin 2022, in which a parent shared ideas for simple but effective costumes they put together for their children.
The original post shows the same costume used in the X posts, but from various different angles, and with no mention of the Israel-Gaza conflict. There is also no Hebrew watermark over the original images.
The Gaza health ministry, which is controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas, has been accused of inflating casualty figures during the conflict with Israel, notably in the aftermath ofan explosionat the al-Ahli hospital last month.
However, videos fromother countries, photos fromprotests, and behind-the-scenesfootagefrommovies, have been used to claim that Palestinians are faking evidence of casualties in Gaza.
Verdict
Misleading. The photo of a Halloween’s costume in Thailand last year has been misleadingly cited as evidence that Palestinians are faking images of casualties.

Tánaiste seeking 35 Irish citizens in Gaza to be evacuated via Egypt 'as early as possible',"LAST UPDATE|1 Nov 2023
TÁNAISTE MICHEÁL MARTIN said he wants the 35 Irish citizens who are currently in Gaza to be included in evacuation efforts “as early as possible”.
The Rafah border crossing opened today to allow foreigners and dual nationals to flee the besieged region.
It’s the first time Egypt has opened the Rafah crossing since the Israel-Hamas war began on 7 October.
It was not immediately clear how many people managed to leave via Rafah on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, but live footage from the scene showed crowds of people entering the Palestinian side of the terminal.
Foreign governments say there are passport holders from 44 countries, as well as 28 agencies, including UN bodies, living in the Gaza Strip where 2.4 million people have endured more than three weeks of unrelenting Israeli bombardment.
However, the Department of Foreign Affairs has not been notified of any Irish citizens being included in this first group.
A spokesperson said the Department is “urgently seeking to have Irish people included in subsequent evacuations”.
Earlier, Martin has said he was shocked by Israel’s strike on Gaza’s largest refugee camp yesterday and said it was unjustifiable in his view.
Speaking on The Pat Kenny Show on Newstalk this morning, Martin said yesterday’s attack by Israel on the Jabaliya refugee camp was not a proportional response and highlights the need for a ceasefire.
According to Israel, the strike killed at least 47 people yesterday – including a Hamas commander involved in the 7 October attacks.
Hamas said seven hostages from its 7 October attacks, including three foreign passport holders, were killed inthe strike.
“I was shocked by that strike on the Jabaliya refugee camp and the deaths of many, many civilians…Whole families destroyed, killed. Fathers talking about losing their children.
“It’s horrific, it’s not justifiable and in our view, it adds pressure to the need to have a humanitarian pause here, a humanitarian ceasefire to allow aid to get in,” he said.
The Tánaiste said Israel has the right to “go after Hamas” but said there is an “issue of proportionality” because when you bomb a refugee camp there is “no doubt” many civilians will die.
“The pressure is so great on the civilian population now and the United Nations agencies are saying to us that this is a human catastrophe happening before our very eyes that it demands a pause in the initial phase.
“Nobody is saying that Israel does not have a right to go after Hamas after the murder of so many Israeli civilians,” Martin said.

He added that there is a moral question and a legal question when it comes to the targets chosen by Israel.
“In my view, what is Israel saying that if we take out a commander of Hamas and some underground tunnels that that’s worth so many hundred lives, is that the moral question that is being put before us?
“I’m very clear on what side I’m on that you cannot knowingly take out hundreds of civilians that are not Hamas because of the cowardly and unacceptable and illegal use of civilians as human shields,” Martin said.
The Tánaiste said he believes that fundamentally the current war needs to lead to a political track “where there is once and for all a determined attempt to try and resolve the fundamentals of a Palestinian state that lives in harmony alongside the state of Israel”.
He said he does not see this happening in the short-term but added that he does sense a collective view internationally that things cannot return to the way they were once there is a de-escalation of violence.
“In the meantime, we have to focus on the humanitarian plight of those living in Gaza,” he said.
The Tánaiste also recalled hisrecent visitto Israel in September and said it was “quite depressing” leaving because the situation was “clearly becoming worse”.
Later, Martin told RTÉ radio  that Irish peacekeeping troops in Lebanon will continue to be placed there within the UNIFIL operation as normal despite fears of a regional escalation in violence.
“Our job is to keep the peace, our job is to look after civilians in the event of any increased escalation,” he said.
“We’ve been here before in the 70s and early 2000s when there was a war going on and it’s something we don’t want to see of course and part of the conversations I’ve been having and the general consensus is that everything must be done to avoid regional escalation in Lebanon or elsewhere,” he said.
Egypt yesterday condemned the strike on Jabalia camp “in the strongest terms”, warning against “the consequences of the continuation of these indiscriminate attacks that target defenceless civilians” in a foreign ministry statement.
Internet and phone networks were down across the Gaza Strip today, the Palestinian telecommunications agency said, in the second such blackout in the besieged territory in less than a week.
Global network monitor Netblocks confirmed that Gaza “is in the midst of a new internet blackout with high impact to the last remaining major operator, Paltel.
“The incident will be experienced as a total loss of telecommunications by most residents,” it said in a post on X.
A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said that while the Department is in regular communication with Irish citizens on the ground in Gaza, there are “ongoing communication challenges”.
Martin told RTÉ: “Communications over the last 48 hours in particular became much more difficult, with internet and all communications cut off, as the Israeli army began their incursion into Gaza and their bombing again, so that has made things challenging.”

Hamas says seven hostages killed in Gaza camp bombing,"LAST UPDATE|1 Nov 2023

HAMAS HAS SAID seven hostages from its 7 October attacks, including three foreign passport holders, were killed in yesterday’s strike on Gaza’s largest refugee camp.
This comes as hundreds of wounded Gaza residents and foreigners have streamed into the border crossing with Egypt, the first people set to escape the shattered Palestinian territory in more than three weeks of devastating war with Israel.
AFP images showed whole families carrying their belongings and several injured people in wheelchairs as well as ambulances entering the heavily fortified gates at the Rafah border crossing – the only one not controlled by Israel.
“We are overwhelmed … Have mercy on us. We are Egyptians and can’t cross into our country,” Umm Yussef, a dual Palestinian-Egyptian national, told AFP on the Gaza side.
“Let us in. We are exhausted. We can’t sleep or eat.”
Egypt announced that the most badly wounded, foreigners, and dual nationals could flee Gaza, which has suffered weeks of relentless bombardment by Israel.
The bombing campaign has killed than 8,500 people, mostly civilians and including more than 3,500 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel has pounded Gaza for more than three weeks in retribution for the worst attack in the country’s history, when Hamas gunmen stormed across the border, killing 1,400 people, also mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials.
AFP reporters saw more tanks pour over the border into northern Gaza, as Israel stepped up its ground incursion.
Images provided by the military showed troops picking through bombed-out houses searching for militants or some of the 240 hostages seized by Hamas.
Israel said 11 of its soldiers had been killed yesterday in “fierce battles” with Hamas militants “deep inside the Gaza Strip”.
Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, has vowed to turn Gaza into a “graveyard” for invading forces.
The border opening with Egypt provided the first glimmer of hope in the flaring humanitarian crisis in Gaza which the UN and other aid agencies have described as “unprecedented”.

A strike on Gaza’s largest refugee camp killed at least 47 people yesterday – including a Hamas commander involved in the 7 October attacks, according to Israel.
A large explosion ripped through the densely packed Jabalia camp before nightfall, tearing facades off nearby buildings and leaving a deep, debris-littered crater.
AFP witnessed at least 47 corpses being recovered.
Horrified resident Ragheb Aqal, 41, likened the explosion to “an earthquake” and spoke of seeing “homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers”.
Israel said its warplanes had struck a “vast” tunnel complex at the site, killing “many Hamas terrorists”, including local battalion commander Ibrahim Biari.
But the strike sparked a chorus of condemnation from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and also further afield in Bolivia, which cut off diplomatic ties in protest – a decision Israel labelled “surrender to terrorism”.
Hamas said today that seven hostages from its 7 October attacks, including three foreign passport holders, were killed in the bombing.
“Seven detainees were killed in the Jabalia massacre yesterday, including three holders of foreign passports,” said a Hamas military wing statement.
No details were given and it was not possible to independently verify the claim.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains desperate, with food, fuel, and medicine for the 2.4 million residents all running short, according to aid groups.
Surgeons are conducting amputations on hospital floors without anaesthetic, and children are forced to drink salty water, said Jean-Francois Corty, vice-president of Medecins du Monde, which has 20 staff on the ground.
The Palestinian telecommunications agency said today that phone and internet services had “been completely cut off in Gaza”, the second such blackout in a week.
Palestinian residents told AFP they had evacuated from northern Gaza, as demanded by Israel, but they were still under threat.
“We’ve been told people are evacuating from Gaza City towards the central area of the Strip beyond the valley, so we headed there. After 20 days, we were bombarded. Three of our kids lost their lives and we all got injured,” Amen Al Aqlouk told AFP.
“There is no hope in the Gaza Strip. It is not safe anymore here. When the border opens, everybody will leave and emigrate. We encounter death everyday, 24 hours a day.”

Israeli officials said 70 trucks with aid were allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt Tuesday, one of the biggest flows since a US-brokered deal was reached, but much less than humanitarian groups say is needed.
Fearing supplies entering Gaza could be diverted to Hamas, or that aid shipments could conceal arms or other supplies, Israel’s security personnel carry out stringent inspections that have slowed the flow of aid to a trickle.
Speaking to RTÉ’sMorning Ireland, Israel’s Labour Party leader Merav Michaeli said that “Israel is operating according to international law”.
“Both in making the … strongest possible effort in distinction between Hamas people and cilivian population. It is also allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza. It is doing its best to prevent hurting innocent people, but the ones who are using and hurting those people are Hamas,” Michaeli said.
With fears mounting the violence could spiral into a regional war, US President Joe Biden called for “urgent mechanisms” to dial down tensions and said they would send his top diplomat Antony Blinken on another Middle East tour from Friday.
Israelis are facing a daily barrage of aerial attacks from Hamas and other Iran-backed groups around the Middle East.
Yemen’s Huthi rebels said they had “launched a large batch of ballistic missiles… and a large number of armed aircraft” towards Israel yesterday.
Israel’s military said a “hostile aircraft intrusion” had set off warning sirens in Eilat, its Red Sea resort, and a surface-to-surface missile was “successfully intercepted.”
In the north, Israel has traded near-daily fire with Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.
And the families of hostages have an unbearable wait for news of relatives thought to be held in the labyrinth of tunnels deep below Gaza.
Ayelet Sella, whose seven cousins were kidnapped from one of the kibbutz communities raided by Hamas gunmen, said she could find “no rest” until her loved ones are returned.
“We have no tears, our eyes are dry, we are empty three weeks on,” said Sella, speaking to AFP at the Great Synagogue in Paris. ”I only ask for one thing, that they come back.”

"Dozens killed in Israeli bombardment of refugee camp, UNICEF calls Gaza a 'graveyard' for children","LAST UPDATE|31 Oct 2023

DOZENS OF PEOPLE have been killed in an Israeli bombardment of the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza, with Israel’s army confirming it had targeted a Hamas commander involved in the 7 October attacks.
Wails filled the dusty air as volunteers clawed through the concrete blocks and twisted metal at the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza in a desperate search for bodies and survivors, with AFP video footage showing at least 47 bodies being recovered.
Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, had no immediate comment on the claim, but quickly vowed to turn Gaza into a “graveyard” for Israeli troops.
Hamas-run Gaza’s health ministry gave an initial toll of more than 50 dead and 150 wounded, but said dozens more were likely buried under the rubble, denouncing what it called “a heinous Israeli massacre” at the camp.
Dozens of onlookers could be seen standing on the edges of two vast craters as people searched for survivors.
Israel’s military confirmed striking the refugee camp saying the operation succeeded in killing a key Hamas commander linked to the 7 October attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group.
“His elimination was carried out as part of a wide-scale strike on terrorists and terror infrastructure belonging to the Central Jabaliya Battalion, which had taken control over civilian buildings in Gaza City,” the military said, referring to the targeting of Ibrahim Biari, the commander of Hamas’ Central Jabaliya Battalion.
Egypt lashed out at Israel’s “inhumane targeting of a residential block”. Sources said Cairo would open the Rafah crossing to treat wounded Palestinians in what would be the first time it has agreed to open the border to civilians since the conflict broke out.
Qatar, a key mediator in the crisis, condemned the Israeli attack on Jabalia and warned expanded strikes on the besieged Palestinian enclave would “undermine mediation and de-escalation efforts”.
The strike came after a day of fierce battles between Israeli ground troops and militants in northern Gaza as Israel pressed its mission to “crush” Hamas after its militants went on a rampage killing 1,400 people, according to Israeli officials, in the worst attack in the country’s history.

Since then, Israel has hit back with an unstinting aerial bombardment, which the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza says has now killed more than 8,500 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children.
At Jabalia camp, hundreds of people could be seen swarming over several large craters punched into the ground, frantically searching through the rubble for survivors as night fell.
“A short while ago, IDF warplanes… assassinated Ibrahim Biari, commander of the Jabalia brigade of the Hamas terrorist organisation, who was one of those who directed the murderous terrorist attack on October 7,” an army statement said.
“After the attack, Hamas’ underground military infrastructure beneath these buildings collapsed,” it added, saying the strike had killed “many Hamas terrorists”.
Camp resident Ragheb Aqal, 41, likened the explosion to “an earthquake” and spoke of his horror at seeing “homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers”.
Jabalia is home to 116,000 people in an area covering 1.4 square kilometres – about the size of London’s Hyde Park.
Earlier, Israel said two of its soldiers had been killed in operations inside Gaza.
The carnage came as international leaders raised the alarm over the spiralling bloodshed and mounting humanitarian crisis in Gaza where several hours before the strikes, the health ministry gave a toll of 8,525 dead, among them 3,542 children and 2,187 women.

Despite the soaring death toll, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had dismissed any chance of a ceasefire late Monday, saying such appeals were “a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism”.
“This will not happen.”

Gaza City resident Ahmed al-Kahlout voiced something of the desperation felt by so many inside the war-torn coastal territory.
“We want to live like any other people in this world, to live quietly,” he said.
“We don’t know what to do. The least they can do is give us a truce, give us three hours, a temporary truce or a ceasefire.”
The European Union’s top diplomat Josep Borrell has renewed calls for a pause in the conflict and condemned the most recent attacks by Israel.
After a series of calls with senior Arab officials, Borrell’s office said he had “expressed great concern over attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians, which he firmly condemned”.
Lebanon has accused Israel of white phosphorus attacks that it said it would file a complaint to the UN over, with a minister alleging the incendiary weapon had burned 40,000 olive trees.
Rights groups and Lebanese officials have repeatedly accused Israel of using the weapon, which can cause serious burns if it hits people – allegations Israel had previously denied.
The humanitarian toll has sparked a global backlash, with aid groups and the United Nations warning time is running out for many of the territory’s 2.4 million people denied access to food, water, fuel and medicine.
“Gaza has become a graveyard for thousands of children. It’s a living hell for everyone else,” said children’s aid agency UNICEF, urging an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”.
“The more than one million children of Gaza also have a water crisis. Gaza’s water production capacity is a mere 5% of its usual daily output. Child deaths – particularly infants – to dehydration are a growing threat,” the spokesperson said.
They added: “And there there is the trauma. When the fighting stops, the cost to children and their communities will be borne out for generations to come.”
Surgeons are conducting amputations on hospital floors without anaesthetic, and children are forced to drink salty water, said Jean-Francois Corty, vice-president of Médecins Sans Frontières, which has 20 staff on the ground.
ActionAid Ireland has warned that women in Gaza are going without urgent medical care due to minimal aid supplies and damaged infrastructure.
Israel has accused Hamas of using hospitals as military headquarters and civilians as “human shields”, charges the group dismisses as “baseless” propaganda.

At a funeral in southern Gaza, tearful mourners cradled the bodies of relatives wrapped in white shrouds before burying them with their bare hands.
“We ask the world to show sympathy for the children to stop these massacres,” Youssef Hijazi, the grandfather of one victim, told AFP.
As even Israel’s staunchest allies voiced concern about the humanitarian crisis in southern Gaza, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA said there was not nearly enough aid to meet the “unprecedented” needs.

“When an eight-year-old tells you that she doesn’t want to die, it’s hard not to feel helpless,” said UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths.
Hisham Adwan, Gaza director of the Rafah crossing with Egypt where some aid has been allowed in, said 36 trucks had been waiting there since the previous day.
“I feel that it’s extremely slow and there’s disruption to UNRWA’s work, and we don’t know why,” he said.
Israel said it is inspecting cargo to make sure weapons are not being smuggled in, and monitoring to guarantee Hamas does not seize the supplies.
The incursion scored an early victory yesterday: the rescue of Private Ori Megidish, an Israeli soldier in Hamas captivity who was reunited with her family.
But there was heartbreak for relatives of another missing woman, 23-year-old German-Israeli Shani Louk, abducted from a music festival then “tortured and paraded around Gaza,” according to Israel’s foreign ministry.
Her remains were found yesterday, with her sister Adi voicing her “great sorrow” as she shared news of her death on social media.

Other families have endured an unbearable wait for news of relatives seized by Hamas militants and thought to be held in a labyrinth of tunnels in Gaza.
Hadas Kalderon walked through the scorched homes of the Nir Oz kibbutz, near Israel’s border with Gaza, where gunmen killed her mother and niece and kidnapped her 12-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter.
“I don’t have any control and knowledge about army actions, I just know my children are still there in the middle of a war,” said the 56-year-old.
“It’s a disaster. It’s really hell. There is no word to express this.”
Hamas yesterday released a video of what it said were three women hostages, seated against a tile wall. One urged Israel to agree to a Hamas-demanded prisoner swap.
Netanyahu dismissed the clip, the time and place of which could not be verified, as “cruel psychological propaganda”.
Meanwhile, in a sign that the conflict risked spiralling throughout the region, Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels fired drones and missiles towards Israel and vowed to keep up attacks.
Israel’s army also said it had intercepted a missile fired from the Red Sea region.
Israel’s military has struck targets in Syria and traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, whose caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati told AFP it was his “duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war”.
Anis Abla, head of Lebanon’s Civil Defense Centre in Marjayoun, near the Israeli border, said they were completely unprepared for war.
“Our equipment is very primitive and there is a shortage of all tools, such as fire suits and extinguisher cylinders,” he told AFP.

Green Brigade banned from Celtic Park as club extend suspension to home matches,"
THE GREEN BRIGADE have been banned from Celtic Park after the club extended its suspension to home matches.
An email to supporters in the standing section has been published on social media showing that Celtic have suspended season tickets for those who have registered with the ticket office as being part of the ‘ultras’ group.
The move comes after incidents including the group’s co-ordination of a display showing solidarity with the people of Palestine at last week’s Champions League game against Atletico Madrid.
Wary of further UEFA disciplinary action, Celtic had asked fans not to bring any flags associated with the Middle East conflict.

An email leaked on social media shows Celtic cited “repeated incidents of unacceptable conduct involving the ‘Green Brigade’ group”. The ban is pending further review and communication with the fans’ group.
Celtic have been fined by UEFA twice this season for displays linked to the Green Brigade section – a pyrotechnic show away at Rotterdam and an “anti-fascist” banner which, according to the European governing body, contained a “provocative message of an offensive nature” towards Lazio.
Other issues apparently cited by Celtic include “rushing turnstiles” at Fir Park, “illegally gained access” ahead of the Lazio match and “unauthorised banners” plus behaviour towards stewards.
Thousands of supporters around Celtic Park had defied the club’s appeal by displaying Palestine flags last Wednesday.
Celtic have been approached for comment.

"Analysis 
 A land war won't go well and faltering international support means the world knows it","FOR THE PAST four decades, Israel’s experience of fighting paramilitary militias has been grim. Its last major operation was in southern Lebanon, which started withOperation Peace for Galilee in 1982.
While initially successful, the subsequent occupation of southern Lebanon led directly to the rise of the Hezbollah Shia militias, persistent losses for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), a withdrawal to a nine-mile security zone within three years and from Lebanon as a whole in 2000.
In 2006 Israeli military units went back into Lebanon to counter Hezbollah rockets but ended with exhausted troops withdrawing in some disarray and the IDF resorting to a massive air war that did huge damage to the infrastructure of much of the country.
Then there is Gaza.
Before the current war, the IDF foughtfour other wars in Gazasince 2007, primarily to control Hamas’s use of rockets and itsgrowing network of infiltration tunnels.

The most significant one wasOperation Protective Edge in 2014which involved troops in a ground assault. In the event, they found the fighting extremely difficult, with the elite Golani Brigade experiencing serious casualties from the start.
Once again, there was intense use of air power and, as in the other wars, it was civilians that suffered most. Overall, the Israelis lost more than 300 killed in those four wars but for the Palestinians in Gaza, thedeath toll exceeded 5,300.
Experiences in other wars are relevant to what happens now in Gaza. After the 9/11 attacks, there was considerable international support for the US. Waragainst the Taliban seemedinevitable, though very few security analysts warned of the US-led coalition falling into a trap. The warnings were ignored and 20 years later the Western troops finally retreated in disarray. Then came the Iraq war from 2003, with warnings once again ignored and, once again, with disastrous results.
As to Gaza, there are multiple concerns aboutwhat comes next, the current incursions being far short of a full-scale ground intervention. There are sharp differences in belief of what should come next within the military and within Benjamin Netanyahu’s government as well as within Israel as a whole, with much of it heightened by the concern over the loss of international support.
There is also concern about theexperience of urban warfareelsewhere. Just six years ago, it took nine months for the US-led coalition to take back the Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State. The US led the huge air assault, aided by France, the UK and other partners. The ground forces then were Iraqi troops and militias and they lost 8,200 troops.

A further 10,000 civilians were killed, and the old city was wrecked. It waslikened to Stalingradin early 1943.
Just last year, a small force of Ukrainian soldiers held off a large Russian force for nearly three months in thesiege of the Azovstal steel works in Mariupolusing a network of 24 kilometres of Soviet-era tunnels. Hamashas constructed vastly more tunnels under Gazaand is no doubt ready for months of combat.

Three weeks ago, Israel suffered a grievous loss and rightly got huge initial support, but that isalready fading. Worse still, there is a terrible inability of the current Israeli government to understand what it is dealing with in a ground invasion of Gaza. But the death toll tells us all we need to know. If we look at the five Gaza wars since 2007, including the current devastating war, the Israelis have lost 1,700 people, but the Palestinians have lost more than 13,000 – and the numbers are rising by hundreds every day.
For now, the public mood in Israelstill supports the Netanyahu government, however unpopular it might have been just a month ago. But the small but persistentcampaign by families of the hostagesfor them to be the priority is having an effect.
Hostage families hold portraits during a press conference Oct. 31, 2023 in Paris. Families of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas militants on Oct. 7 demand their release.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
Above all, it is the change of mood internationally that is a deep concern in Israel and, indeed, in the Biden administration. This was shown by theweekend debate in the UN general assemblywhen only 12 states supported the US and Israel in voting against a “humanitarian pause”. Also, eight EU states were among the 120 supporting the motion and the 45 who abstained even included Britain.
In some previous Israeli military actions, the end has effectively come about when international support for Israel has collapsed or got close to that. If the ground war against Hamas had started within a few days of the shock of 7 October and if that operation had been successful and Hamas had collapsed, then Netanyahu could have claimed success.
That has not happened and will not happen now. Instead, there is every prospect of a bitter war with many thousands more Palestinians killed, tens of thousands of young Palestinians all too ready to fight in the future, and a peaceful resolution of the Israel/Palestine conflict delayed by at least another generation.

Keir Starmer rejects internal pressure to call for Gaza ceasefire as car is mobbed by protesters,"LONDON POLICE WERE forced to intervene after pro-Palestinian protesters mobbed Keir Starmer’s car.
It comes as the UK Labour leader tries to maintain party discipline with members of his frontbench in open revolt about his stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Starmer, who had just delivered a speech defending his approach to the crisis, was ushered into the back of a waiting Land Rover Discovery as protesters shouted at him and demanded an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
Police officers pushed them aside, but the protesters ran at the car carrying the Labour leader and drummed on the window.
The incident happened outside the Chatham House foreign affairs think tank in central London, where Starmer had been setting out why he was not demanding an immediate ceasefire.

The Labour leader has resisted pressure from within his own party to call for a ceasefire, instead urging both parties in the conflict to agree to a humanitarian pause to allow aid in and hostages out of the war zone.
This stance has created internal pressure on Starmer, with Shadow ministers among senior Labour figures demanding a change.
Frontbencher Alex Cunningham called for an “immediate ceasefire” less than an hour before Starmer delivered his speech at Chatham House.
Starmer has also been at odds over its stance on Israel with devolved mayors like Manchester’s Andy Burnham and London’s Sadiq Khan, and with Labour-led councils across England.
Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also criticised Starmer, claiming he had made “hurtful” comments about the conflict and there was “repair work to do” to mend bridges with Muslim communities.
Starmer insisted he took collective responsibility – the principle that members of his frontbench team adopt a unified position – seriously, but he gave no indication he was about to sack those who had spoken out.
“It is for me to address collective responsibility, I recognise that,” he said.
“It matters and I take that duty extremely seriously, but I put it in the context of understanding what is driving people in the call for a ceasefire, which is in my judgment not the call that we should be making as things stand.”
Starmer insisted there was “unity” in Labour over the “key issues” of seeking a two-state solution, the need to alleviate suffering in Gaza but also Israel’s right to self-defence.

He said his response to the crisis was shaped by responding to both the massacre of Jews in Israel by Hamas and the “humanitarian catastrophe” unfolding in Gaza.
Hamas would be “emboldened” by a ceasefire and start preparing for future violence immediately, the UK Labour leader said.
Starmer said: “While I understand calls for a ceasefire at this stage, I do not believe that it is the correct position now for two reasons.
“One, because a ceasefire always freezes any conflict in the state where it currently lies. And, as we speak, that would leave Hamas with the infrastructure and the capabilities to carry out the sort of attack we saw on 7 October.
“Attacks that are still ongoing. Hostages who should be released still held.
“Hamas would be emboldened and start preparing for future violence immediately.”
A humanitarian pause is the “only credible approach”, which could see “the urgent alleviation of Palestinian suffering”.
“Aid distributed quickly. Space to get hostages out,” he said.
“And it is why it is also a position shared by our major allies in the US and the EU.”
Starmer said the consequences of events in Israel and Gaza would “last for decades” and “the trauma might never fade”.
There was a “rising temperature on British streets” as a result of the conflict, he acknowledged.
The Hamas attacks were “the biggest slaughter of Jews – and that is why they were killed, do not doubt that – since the Holocaust”.
In an apparent message to his critics in the UK, Starmer said: “This is terrorism on a scale and brutality that few countries have ever experienced, certainly not this one, and that is an immutable fact that must drive our response to these events.”
But the humanitarian crisis in Gaza was also on a “previously unimaginable scale” with “thousands of innocent Palestinians dead, displaced, desperate for food and water, reduced to drinking contaminated filth, hiding out in hospitals for shelter whilst in those same buildings babies lie in incubators that could turn off at any moment”.
Starmer said it was not an “optional extra” for Israel to obey international law in its response to Hamas and the fundamental right to self-defence “is not a blank cheque”.
The Labour leader said supply of water, medicines, electricity and fuel to citizens in Gaza “cannot be blocked by Israel”.","2.32pm, 31 Oct 2023",Pro-Israel," Netanyahu's statement frames a ceasefire as a surrender, implying that continuing the fight is necessary."
UN agency says urgent ceasefire in Gaza ‘matter of life and death’ for millions,"THE HEAD OF the UN agency for Palestinian refugees told an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting that “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire has become a matter of life and death for millions”, accusing Israel of “collective punishment” of Palestinians.
Philippe Lazzarini warned that a further breakdown of civil order following the looting of the agency’s warehouses by Palestinians searching for food and other aid “will make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the largest UN agency in Gaza to continue operating”.
Briefings to the Security Council by Lazzarini, the head of the UN children’s agency Unicef, and a senior UN humanitarian official painted a dire picture of the humanitarian situation in Gaza 23 days after Hamas’s 7 October attacks in Israel and its ongoing retaliatory military action aimed at “obliterating” the militant group, which controls Gaza.
According to the latest figures from Gaza’s Ministry of Health, more than 8,300 people have been killed – 66% of them women and children – and tens of thousands injured, the UN humanitarian office said.
Unicef executive director Catherine Russell said that toll includes over 3,400 children killed and more than 6,300 injured.
“This means that more than 420 children are being killed or injured in Gaza each day – a number which should shake each of us to our core,” she said.
Lazzarini said: “This surpasses the number of children killed annually across the world’s conflict zones since 2019. This cannot be collateral damage.”
Many speakers at the council meeting denounced Hamas’s attacks on Israel that killed over 1,400 people and urged the release of some 230 hostages taken to Gaza by the militants.
Nearly every speaker also stressed that Israel is obligated under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and their essentials for life including hospitals, schools and other infrastructure.

Israel was criticised for cutting off food, water, fuel and medicine to Gaza and cutting communications for several days.
Lazzarini said “the handful of convoys” allowed into Gaza through the Rafah crossing from Egypt in recent days “is nothing compared to the needs of over 2 million people trapped in Gaza”.
“The system in place to allow aid into Gaza is geared to fail,” he said, “unless there is political will to make the flow of supplies meaningful, matching the unprecedented humanitarian needs”.
US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield urged the divided Security Council – which has rejected four resolutions that would have responded to the Hamas attacks and the ongoing war – to come together, saying “the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing more dire by the day”.
Stressing that all innocent civilians must be protected, she said the council must call “for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, address the immense humanitarian needs of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, affirm Israel’s right to defend itself from terrorism, and remind all actors that international humanitarian law must be respected”.
She reiterated US President Joe Biden’s calls for humanitarian pauses to get hostages out and allow aid in, and for safe passage for civilians.
Israel’s UN ambassador Gilad Erdan was sharply critical of the council’s failure to condemn Hamas’s attacks and asked members: “Why are the humanitarian needs of Gazans, the sole issue, the sole issue you are focused on?”
Recalling his grandfather who survived Nazi death camps but whose wife and seven children perished in the Auschwitz gas chamber, Erdan told the council he will wear a yellow star – as Hitler made his grandfather and other Jewish people wear during the Second World War – “until you condemn the atrocities of Hamas and demand the immediate release of our hostages”.
The ambassador then put a large six-pointed yellow star of David saying Never Again on his suit jacket, as did other Israeli diplomats sitting behind him, and said: “We walk with the yellow star as a symbol of pride, a reminder that we swore to fight back to defend ourselves. Never again is now.”
Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian UN ambassador, also urged the Security Council to end its paralysis, and demand “an end to this bloodshed, which constitutes an affront to humanity, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and a clear and imminent danger for regional and international peace and security”.
He said: “Save those who still can be saved and bury in a dignified manner those who have perished.”","7.11am, 31 Oct 2023",Neutral," International relations aspect involving accusations, not directly tied to bias in the Israel-Gaza conflict."
Israeli PM Netanyahu says ceasefire in Gaza would be 'surrender to Hamas',"LAST UPDATE|30 Oct 2023
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU HAS claimed a ceasefire in The Gaza Strip will be a “surrender to Hamas” in a press conference to foreign press this evening.
During the same event, the Israeli Prime Minister squashed any idea of a ceasefire taking place, claiming that it would not happen.
“I want to make clear Israel’s position regarding a ceasefire,” Netanyahu said. “Just as the United States would not agree to a ceasefire after the bombing of Pearl Harbour of after the terrorist attack of 9/11, Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attacks of 7 October.”
“Calls for ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen,” he said.
Many leaders and organisations, including Irish MEPs and the World Health Organisation, have made calls for a ceasefire over the last week.
Speaking onRTÉ Radio Oneon Saturday, Dr Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the World Health Organisation (WHO), said the only solution is to have a ceasefire in the region.
“The only solution here – the only solution – is to have an immediate ceasefire. That’s on humanitarian grounds,” Harris said.
Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon also called for there to be a ceasefireand said that the communications blackout has been carried out by Israel in order for them to have a tighter control on the narrative from the war.
Since, the United States has pressed Israel to restore internet access to the Gaza Strip and was pleased that Israel had followed suit.
“We made clear to the government of Israel over the weekend that communications networks needed to be restored and we are pleased that they took steps to do that,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.
On Thursday, EU leaders, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar,reached an agreement calling for “humanitarian corridors and pauses” in the Israel-Hamas conflict,but falling short of demanding a “ceasefire”.
Leo Varadkar speaks to European leaders at the EU Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday.ALEXANDROS MICHAILIDISALEXANDROS MICHAILIDIS
Speaking later, Varadkar said“it’s hard to predict’ if the European Union will call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the future, stating if that position is eventually reached it would only be “after a lot more people have died and suffered in the region”.
A number of Irish MEPs stalled a similar vote this month, where the European Parliament agreed there to be “humanitarian pauses” in the region.
Fine Gael MEP Colm Markey toldThe Journallast week that there needs to be calls for a ceasefire in the region.
Markey, along with several other Irish MEPs, was the only Irish EPP (Fine Gael’s European Parliamentary group) whosigned a joint-letter calling for a ceasefire in the regionon Thursday.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell demanded on Saturday a “pause of hostilities” to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip after the bombing intensified in the coastal territory.
“Far too many civilians, including children, have been killed. This is against International Humanitarian Law,” hesaid on social media.
Netanyahu said that other countries must give more help in the struggle to free more than 230 hostages seized by Hamas in its 7 October attacks.
He said the international community must demand the captives “be freed immediately, unconditionally”.
On Saturday, Hamas said it would free all the hostages it captured on 7 October if Israel promised to free all Palestinian prisoners from its state. This prisoner swap suggestion was immediately shot down by Netanyahu.

Earlier the Israeli Defence Forces confirmed that a female soldier, who was taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October, has been freed by the militant group.
“Last night, soldier Ori Megidish was released during a ground operation after being kidnapped by Hamas on October 7,” the army said in a statement.
“The soldier was medically checked, is doing well, and has met with her family.”

Over 230 hostages still remain captured in Gaza by Hamas. Netanyahu said today that the international community should be calling for the release of the hostages
Meanwhile, Israeli tanks have been seen entering the outskirts of Gaza City today, witnesses told journalists from the AFP news agency by phone.
Witness reports added that Israeli forces have blocked the main north-south Gaza highway.
This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his war cabinet today that Israel is making “systematic progress” in its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza.
Netanyahu said the Israeli army “has expanded its ground entry into the Gaza Strip, it is doing it in measured, very powerful steps, making systematic progress one step at a time”, according to an official video statement.
Israel said its forces last night killed “dozens” of militants on clashes as it pressed forward with its military response to Hamas attacks earlier this month.
The Israeli army said “troops killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels and attempted to attack the troops”, and that a fighter jet had targeted a building “with over 20 Hamas terrorist operatives inside”.
Earlier, Hamas said it was engaged in “heavy fighting” with Israeli troops inside northern Gaza, where besieged residents were again told to flee.
“They are firing at any vehicle that tries to go along it,” one resident said.

The army said it had hit “more than 600 targets in the past 24 hours”, up from 450 the previous day, and killed “dozens” of militants. Hamas militants also reported “heavy fighting” in northern Gaza.
After weeks of ferocious air strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared a new “stage” in whathe warned will be a “long and difficult” war.
Israel’s military released a series of images late last night purporting to show tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and equipment-laden infantrymen operating inside Palestinian territory.
With a fierce urban war now feared, Israeli army spokesmanDaniel Hagari told Palestinian civilians to go south “to a safer area”.
Although huge numbers of Gazans have heeded Israel’s warning to flee south, tens of thousands more are believed to remain in the area.
“We are gradually expanding the ground activity and the scope of our forces in the Gaza Strip,” he said.
Speaking this evening, Netanyahu said: “Ladies and gentleman, the Bible said ‘There is a time for peace and there is a time for war’. This is a time for war.”
It is now more than three weeks since Hamas gunmen launched a wave of bloody cross-border raids against homes, communities, farms and security posts inside Israel.
An estimated 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 239 people were taken hostage, according to the latest Israeli tallies.
Grieving and enraged, Israel has vowed to free the hostages, track down those responsible and “eradicate” Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist movement that has governed Gaza since 2007.
But there is growing international concern about the toll of Israel’s campaign on Gaza’s 2.4 million residents. The territory is under siege, with people unable to leave and only a trickle of humanitarian aid allowed in.
Meanwhile, Israel has carried out one of the most intense bombing campaigns in recent memory. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry says more than 8,000 people, mainly civilians, have been killed, many of them children.
The UN also reported that 33 trucks carrying water, food and medical supplies had entered Gaza from Egypt on 29 October.
It is one of the largest deliveries to date, but still far short of the 100 trucks a day that aid groups say is needed. International Criminal Court lead prosecutor Karim Khan warned Israel yesterday that preventing access to humanitarian aid could be a “crime”.

Russia accuses Ukraine of playing a 'key role' in anti-Israel airport riot,"LAST UPDATE|30 Oct 2023

RUSSIA HAS ACCUSED Ukraine of playing a “key role” in an anti-Israel riot at an airport in the Muslim-majority region of Dagestan on Sunday.
“The criminal Kyiv regime played a direct and key role in carrying out the latest destructive act,” Russia’s foreign affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.
Kyiv immediately denounced the claim and said Moscow are trying to “shift responsibility” over the Dagestan riot.
“Accusing Ukraine of involvement in the events in Dagestan by the Russian foreign ministry is an attempt to shift responsibility from a sick person to a healthy one,” Kyiv’s foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said on Facebook.
“The events in Makhachkala reflect deep-rooted anti-Semitism of Russian elites and society.”
Earlier, The Kremlin blamed “external interference” for an anti-Israel riot that closed an airport in the region.

“Yesterday’s events at Makhachkala airport are, to a large extent, the result of external interference,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Russian police said they had arrested 60 people suspected of storming the airport, seeking to attack Jewish passengers coming from Israel.
Dozens of protesters, many of them chanting “Allahu akbar” (God is greatest), broke through doors and barriers at Makhachkala airport yesterday, with some charging onto the runway.
“Against the backdrop of TV footage showing the horrors of what is happening in the Gaza Strip – the deaths of people, children, old people, it is very easy for enemies to take advantage of and provoke the situation,” Peskov told reporters.
The Kremlin did not provide further details on its claim of “external interference”.
State media earlier cited Dagestan’s governor as saying the “initiators of this action are our enemies who organised it from Ukrainian territory”.
In response to the events, President Vladimir Putin was due to hold a meeting with his top advisers, including the defence minister and spy chiefs, later on Monday to discuss “the West’s attempts to use the events in the Middle East to split Russian society,” Peskov said.

Hamas says it's involved in 'heavy fighting' in Gaza as UN warns civil order 'starting to break down',"LAST UPDATE|29 Oct 2023

HAMAS SAYS ITS its fighters are engaged in “heavy fighting” in Gaza where Israel has escalated ground operations, while the UN said desperate Palestinians burst into aid centres after weeks of siege and bombardment.
World leaders underlined the urgency of delivering aid to the Hamas-run territory and protesters worldwide rallied for a ceasefire, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu steeled his nation for a “long and difficult war”.
Despite calls for a humanitarian truce, international outrage and the potential risk to hostages held in Gaza, Israel has intensified the war triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented attack.
Hamas militants stormed across the Gaza border on 7 October in the deadliest attack in Israel’s history, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping 230 others, according to Israeli officials.
The health ministry in Gaza says the retaliatory Israeli bombardment has killed more than 8,000 people, mainly civilians and half of them children.
Panic and fear have surged inside the Palestinian territory, where the UN says more than half of its 2.4 million residents are displaced and thousands of buildings destroyed.
Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said today its “fighters are currently engaged in heavy fighting with machine-guns and anti-tank weapons with the invading occupation (Israeli) forces in northwest Gaza”.
Israel’s army said a new “stage” of the war started with ground incursions since late Friday, an escalation from two brief operations earlier in the week.
‘Catastrophic failing’
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron “stressed the importance of getting urgent humanitarian support into Gaza” during a conversation today, the UK government said.
UN chief Antonio Guterres said the situation was “growing more desperate by the hour” as casualties increase and essential supplies of food, water, medicine and shelter dwindle.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Israel was repeatedly bombing around Al-Quds hospital in central Gaza, causing damage and putting civilians at risk.
Mohamed al-Talmas, who has taken shelter in Gaza’s biggest hospital Shifa, said “the ground shook” with intense Israeli raids.
“No one knew where they (strikes) were coming from — north, south, east or west.”

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said “thousands of people” broke into several of its warehouses and distribution centres in Gaza, grabbing basic survival items like wheat flour and hygiene supplies.
“This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down,” it said.
Outside a bakery in southern Gaza’s Rafah, Etidal al-Masri was queueing but did not know if she would get bread.
Having been displaced from northern Gaza, Masri lamented that Gazans “must now queue for bread, toilets and even for sleep”.
Communications were down for days after Israel cut internet lines ahead of the intensification of operations in the territory, although connectivity was gradually returning today.
Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, voiced shock at the suffering in Gaza and urged all sides to de-escalate.
“This is a catastrophic failing that the world must not tolerate,” she said.
Pro-Palestinian rallies were held in Madrid, Athens and Casablanca calling for a ceasefire.
A US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 40 more aid trucks may enter Gaza today and that Israel was committed to allowing 100 to arrive daily.
‘All areas are dangerous’
Israel’s military said it had struck hundreds of Hamas targets and increased its ground forces in Gaza.
The army said troops had “confronted” militants who emerged out of a tunnel in north Gaza, highlighting challenges in Hamas’s vast underground network to Israel’s ground operation.
In a late-night televised address yesterday, Netanyahu announced a “second stage of the war” to “eradicate” Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that has governed Gaza since 2007.
The “burden” lies with Israel to distinguish between militants and innocent civilians in Gaza, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN television.
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari again urged Palestinian civilians to go south “to a safer area”, but residents remained wary as air strikes continue.
Ibrahim Shandoughli, a 53-year-old from Jabaliya in northern Gaza, told AFP he and his family went nowhere.

“Where do you want us to evacuate to? All the areas are dangerous.”
‘Red lines’
While Israel mourned its dead, sympathy has swelled for the families whose loved ones were abducted by Hamas and are at heightened risk as the war intensifies in Gaza.
Hamas has released four hostages but this week said “almost 50″ had been killed by Israeli strikes, a claim that was impossible to verify.
“We demanded that no action be taken that endangers the fate of our family members,” said Meirav Leshem Gonen, the mother of hostage Romi Gonen.
Hamas’s armed wing said it was prepared to release the hostages if Israel freed the Palestinian prisoners it was holding.
Ifat Kalderon, whose relatives are believed held in Gaza, told AFP she supported the idea of a prisoner release in exchange for the hostages.
“Take them, we don’t need them here,” she said, referring to Palestinian detainees.
The ground operations have heightened fears that Israel’s other enemies – the Iran-allied “axis of resistance” forces in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen – enter the conflict.
Top ally the United States has warned Israel’s enemies to stay out and strengthened its military presence in the region.
Skirmishes have intensified on the Israeli-Lebanese border with Iran-backed Hamas ally Hezbollah, raising fears of a new front.
Hezbollah, which reported one of its fighters was killed on Sunday, said it downed an Israeli drone, while Hamas’s military wing in Lebanon announced it had launched rockets at Israel.
Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi warned on X, formerly Twitter, that Israel’s “crimes have crossed the red lines, which may force everyone to take action”.
Violence has also spiked in the occupied West Bank since the October 7 attacks, with more than 110 Palestinians killed, according to the territory’s health ministry.","7.38am, 29 Oct 2023",Pro-Israel," Statement preparing for prolonged military engagement, suggesting readiness and determination."
"Collective punishment in Gaza 
 'An old and familiar tactic, on a new and devastating scale'","MORE CHILDREN HAVE been killed in Palestine and Israel in three weeks than are killed on averageannuallyin all of the world’s major conflicts combined. Over2,900Palestinian children have been killed since the bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces began. At least29 Israeli childrenwere killed in the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 and a further32 Palestinian childrenhave been killed in the West Bank.
These numbers, already staggering, will no doubt rise even further. Hundreds of Palestinian children are missing or trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings in Gaza, while the full details of the approximately 1,400 Israelis killed have yet to be released. At leasttwenty childrenare being held as hostages by Hamas in the Gaza strip.
The high casualty rate is practically inevitable when civilians are intentionally used as instruments for the pursuit of military or political goals. International law has long rejected such an approach to waging war. There is a nucleus of binding rules in theFourth Geneva Convention of 1949which reflect this consensus: collective penalties, measures of intimidation or terrorism, reprisals against civilians and the taking of hostages are prohibited outright. Such practices can amount to war crimes.
Prior to the Second World War, collective punishment was a common tactic used by warring parties, particularly colonial powers and those occupying foreign territory. Punishing a civilian population for the acts of individuals was considered a means of maintaining order and suppressing resistance. Such measures were also a vehicle for revenge.
Collective punishment and reprisals were a feature of the Irish War of Independence 1919-1921. Following the IRA killing of a RIC District Inspector in Balbriggan in September 1920,“twenty five houses and seven businesses … were burned to the ground”by members of the RIC and Black and Tans.

The laws of war required considerable updating after the horrors of the Second World War. The existing rule against collective penalties was somewhat ambiguous, while there was no explicit prohibition of reprisals or hostage-taking. But while efforts to develop what became the 1949 Geneva Conventions were underway, and the Allies were prosecuting their defeated opponents for having engaged in such practices, the British were providing the framework for further collective punishment in Mandatory Palestine.
TheDefence (Emergency) Regulations 1945gave British military commanders the power to destroy any building from which hostile acts were carried out or if the inhabitants were somehow implicated. Israel has relied upon these Regulations to destroy thousands of Palestinian homes as punishment since its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in 1967. TheSupreme Court of Israelhas frequently upheld this practice of collective punishment.
Palestinian,Israeliandinternationalcivil society organisations, as well as United Nationsbodiesandexperts, have documented and denounced for decades numerous instances of collective punishment imposed in varying forms on Palestinians by the Israeli authorities as a response to individual hostile or criminal acts. The imposition of collective punishment in violation of international humanitarian law is not a new phenomenon.
The killing of civilians and the taking of hostages by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the attacks of 7 October 2023 – the most significant loss of Israeli lives in decades – are unquestionably contrary to international humanitarian law and could constitute war crimes. The Prosecutor of theInternational Criminal Court, Karim Khan, has confirmed that the Court’s jurisdiction would cover such atrocities.
The response by Israel, however, has disregarded its obligations under international humanitarian law. The blockade and unrelenting military assault on the Gaza strip constitute a collective punishment of previously unseen magnitude against Palestinian civilians. This view was echoed by theUN’s Secretary GeneralAntónio Guterres at the Security Council earlier this week.
Thousands have already been killed or injured, an estimated1.4 millionPalestinians displaced,11,000 buildingsdamaged or destroyed and ahealth systemdecimated. Oxfam has said that“starvation is being used as a weapon of war”against the civilians of Gaza.
Israeli officials have made their intentions clear. The Minister of DefenceYoav Gallant, when announcing the strict siege of Gaza, said “[t]here will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly”. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said that the emphasis was“on damage and not accuracy”, while a former major general put it that“[c]reating a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a necessary means to achieve the goal”. The Minister for Energy reiterated that there would be no electricity, water or fuel“until the Israeli abductees are returned home”.

Some, but certainly not all States, have criticised Israel’s response. The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar felt that the siege of Gaza“amounts to collective punishment”along withGuterres. The EU’s approach has been deeply disappointing. Initial vague references to upholding international law, have been followed byJosep Borrell, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, stating that “Hamas shouldn’t be confused with the Palestinian people and the civilian population of Gaza cannot be held collectively responsible for its criminal actions”.
Despite the broad condemnation of Israel’s actions as collective punishment byPalestinian,Israeliandinternationalhuman rights organisations, as well as byUN human rights special rapporteurs, two major concerns remain. The first is that Israel continues to act with complete impunity.
States are not fulfilling their obligation to ensure respect for the 1949 Geneva Conventions “in all circumstances”. Indeed, certain Western countries are actively assisting and could therefore be seen to be complicit in Israel’s unlawful acts.
The second serious concern is that Israel’s collective punishment of the civilian population may not merely be aimed at pressuring Hamas to release the Israeli hostages, but serves to further other goals, such as the forced displacement of Palestinians from some or indeed all of Gaza.
With the population in Gaza having almost nowhere to go and in a context of grave violations of international humanitarian law and dehumanising language towards Palestinians, we should take very seriously the growing warnings of a“risk of genocide against the Palestinian people”.
Professor Shane Darcy is Deputy Director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights in the School of Law at the University of Galway and the author of several publications on the prohibition and war crime of collective punishment under international law.

Israeli PM Netanyahu says fighting in Gaza will be 'long and difficult',"
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER Benjamin Netanyahu has said that fighting in Gaza will be “long and difficult” as the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) confirmed it has had troops on the ground in the region for over 24 hours.
Speaking at a press conference this evening, Netanyahu said: “The war in the [Gaza] Strip will be long and difficult and we are prepared for it.”
Netanyahuspoke to the pressafter meeting families of hostages held in Gaza since surprise Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October.
Hamas today said it would release all 220 hostages, taken during the attack, if Israel released all Palestinian prisoners in its custody.
Hamas’s leader in the Gaza Strip said this evening that the Palestinian militant group was ready for an “immediate” prisoner swap with Israel.
“We are ready to conduct an immediate prisoner exchange deal that includes the release of all Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in exchange for all prisoners held by the Palestinian resistance,” Sinwar said in a statement.
Netanyahu made no commitment to any exchange deal but told the families authorities would “exhaust every option to bring them (the hostages) home”.
He added that defeating Hamas was an “existential test” for Israel, charging that 90 percent of the group’s military budget came from Iran.
“We must defeat Hamas because the test is an existential test for us,” Netanyahu told a news conference.

“Iran supports Hamas. I think that 90 percent of Hamas’s military budget comes from Iran. It funds, it organises, it directs it.”
Earlier, the IDF dropped leaflets from their fighter jets, whilst flying over Northern Gaza, which warn citizens to evacuate south.
The leaflets told citizens that the area was now a “battlefield”. Israeli forces have stepped up their air campaign against Hamas militants in the Palestinian territory.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sharply criticized the “unprecedented escalation” of bombardments on Gaza and urged an “immediate” ceasefire.
“Instead of the pause” he had expected, there has been “an unprecedented escalation of the bombardments and their devastating impacts, undermining the referred humanitarian objectives,” Guterres said on a visit to Doha.
“Israel must immediately stop this madness and end its attacks,” Turkish President Erdogan wrote on X, formerly Twitter, today, after the UN General Assembly called for an “immediate humanitarian truce” in Gaza.
Erdogan later called Western powers “the main culprit” behind the Israeli army’s “massacre” of Palestinians in Gaza.
Israel has since ordered its envoy in Turkey to leave the country as a result of Ergodan’s comments.
Speaking onRTÉ Radio Onethis afternoon, Dr Margaret Harris, Spokesperson for the World Health Organisation (WHO), said the only solution is to have a ceasefire in the region.

Humanitarian crisis deepens as Israeli Defence Forces warn Gaza City citizens to evacuate south,"LAST UPDATE|28 Oct 2023

ISRAELI DEFENCE FORCES have dropped leaflets from their fighter jets, whilst flying over Northern Gaza, which warn citizens to evacuate south.
The leaflets told citizens that the area was now a “battlefield”. Israeli forces have stepped up their air campaign against Hamas militants in the Palestinian territory.
“To the residents of the Gaza Strip: The Gaza governorate (Gaza City) has become a battlefield. Shelters in northern Gaza and Gaza governorate are not safe,” the army said in leaflets dropped by fighter jets, as it urged residents to “evacuate immediately” to the south.

On X, formerly Twitter, this afternoon, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) claimed this is a measure which has been done by its forces many times over the last number of weeks.
The IDF also shared a video on X which told the citizens that the measure is “temporary”.
IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said: “This is a temporary measure. Moving back to Northern Gaza will be possible once the intense hostilities end.”

Hagari added that the IDF intend to “neutralise” the threat of Hamas from the area.
Hamas’s armed wing said it was ready to release the hostages it abducted during its shock attack on 7 October if Israel freed all Palestinians held in its prisons.
“The price to pay for the large number of enemy hostages in our hands is to empty the (Israeli) prisons of all Palestinian prisoners,” Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Obeida said in a statement broadcast by the Hamas-run Al-Aqsa television channel.
“If the enemy wants to close this file of detainees in one go, we are ready for it. If it wants to do it step-by-step, we are ready for that too.”
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sharply criticized the “unprecedented escalation” of bombardments on Gaza and urged an “immediate” ceasefire.
“Instead of the pause” he had expected, there has been “an unprecedented escalation of the bombardments and their devastating impacts, undermining the referred humanitarian objectives,” Guterres said on a visit to Doha.
The IDF confirmed that it was still on the ground inside Northern Gaza today, as Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu that fighting inside the Gaza Strip would be “long and difficult”.
“The war in the [Gaza] Strip will be long and difficult and we are prepared for it,” Netanyahu told a news conference after meeting families of hostages held in Gaza.
Netanyahu told reporters at press conference this evening that Israel would explore “every option” to secure the release of more than 220 hostages taken by Palestinian militants to Gaza.
Earlier, Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel’s war against Palestinian militant group Hamas has “entered a new phase” with the intense overnight bombing of the Gaza Strip.
“We have entered a new phase in the war. Last night the ground in Gaza shook. We attacked above ground and below ground,” Gallant said in a video statement, alluding to the network of military tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza.
“The instructions to the forces are clear: the action will continue until further notice.”
Israel launched its withering bombardment of Gaza after Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on 7 October, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking nearly 230 others hostage, according to Israeli officials.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip said today that Israeli strikes have killed 7,703 people, more than 3,000 of them children.
The latest Israeli raids were one of the most intense nights of attacks since the war began and coincided with ground operations.
With tens of thousands of troops massed along the Gaza border ahead of an expected full-blown invasion, Israeli forces had also made limited ground incursions on Wednesday and Thursday nights.

“Hundreds of buildings and houses were completely destroyed and thousands of other homes were damaged,” said Gaza Civil Defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal.
The intense bombardment had “changed the landscape” of northern Gaza, he told AFP.
Hundreds of Hamas fighters crossed the Israeli border in vehicles, by air and sea on 7 October, indiscriminately killing civilians in the streets, in their homes and at an outdoor rave party.
The unprecedented attack caught Israel off guard and exposed serious intelligence failings.
“The army entered the Gaza Strip and extended its operations” with tanks and artillery, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Saturday.
Israeli fighter jets hit 150 “terror tunnels, underground combat spaces and additional underground infrastructure” and “several Hamas terrorists were killed”, the army said.
The military also published images purporting to show strikes and its tanks manoeuvring within the Gaza Strip.

Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it was “confronting an Israeli ground incursion” in Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip and east Bureij in the centre.
Israeli warplanes flew overhead today and regular concussive booms could be heard coming from Gaza, where many buildings lay in ruins, AFP journalists saw.
A thick haze of smoke covered Gaza and southern Israel after the night of heavy bombardment.
“There are a large number of martyrs and a large number of survivors under the rubble, and we cannot reach them,” a Gaza civil defence official said.
The families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas demanded today an immediate government explanation about their fate after the army intensified strikes on Gaza.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents some 229 people believed abducted by Hamas, said the war cabinet failed to explain to relatives whether the ground operation endangered the captives’ well-being.
“The families are worried about the fate of their loved ones and are waiting for an explanation. Every minute feels like eternity,” the group said.

On Thursday, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades said “almost 50″ hostages had been killed in Israeli bombing raids since 7 October. AFP could not immediately verify the figure.
Hamas said all internet connections and communications across Gaza had been cut, accusing Israel of taking the measure “to perpetrate massacres with bloody retaliatory strikes from the air, land and sea”.
Human Rights Watch also warned the near-total telecommunications blackout in Gaza risked providing cover for “mass atrocities”.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said the communications outage had disrupted ambulance services.
Lynne Hastings, the UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, also stressed on X that “hospitals & humanitarian operations can’t continue without communications”.

The spokesperson for the WHO said that it has become difficult for the organisation to contact their assistance on the ground in Gaza, as communication and power is being cut in the region.
The non-binding resolution yesterday received overwhelming support, with 120 votes in favour, 14 against and 45 abstentions.
It was welcomed by Hamas but harshly criticised by Israel and the United States for failing to mention Hamas, with Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan calling it an “infamy”.

In London today, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in the city centre calling for an immediate ceasefire in the deadly war.
It was the third consecutive weekend that the British capital had seen a large rally in support of Palestinians since the attack by Hamas on Israel earlier this month.
On RTÉ, Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon also called for there to be a ceasefire and said that the communications blackout has been carried out by Israel in order for them to have a tighter control on the narrative from the war.
Gannon told the programme: “The international community has to be loud here. The resolution yesterday from the UN is welcome, but we can’t have Israel – who’s supposed to be a member that – just simply defy that call.”
Israel’s bombardment has displaced more than 1.4 million people inside the crowded territory, according to the UN, even as supplies of food, water and power to Gaza have been almost completely cut off.
Israel has blocked all deliveries of fuel, saying it would be exploited by Hamas to manufacture weapons and explosives.
“Without a fundamental change, the people of Gaza will face an unprecedented avalanche of human suffering,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell demanded on Saturday a “pause of hostilities” to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip after the intense overnight bombing of the coastal territory.
“Gaza is in complete blackout and isolation while heavy shelling continues. UNRWA warns about the desperate situation of Gaza people without electricity, food, water,” hesaid on social media.
“Far too many civilians, including children, have been killed. This is against International Humanitarian Law,” he said.
“A pause of hostilities is urgently needed to enable humanitarian access,” Borrell added.
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said Gazans were “not only dying from bombs and strikes, soon many more will die from the consequences of (the) siege”.
A first tranche of aid was allowed in last weekend, but only 74 trucks have crossed since then. The UN says an average of 500 trucks entered Gaza every day before the conflict.
“These few trucks are nothing more than crumbs that will not make a difference,” Lazzarini said.
Between the bombardments and the fuel shortages, 12 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals have been forced to close, and UNRWA said it has had to “significantly reduce its operations”.
Israel’s military accused Hamas of using hospitals in Gaza as operations centres for directing attacks, an allegation Hamas denied.
Violence has also risen sharply in the occupied West Bank since the 7 October attacks, with more than 100 Palestinians killed and nearly 2,000 wounded, according to the UN.

What is a war crime and is international law being broken in Israel and Gaza?,"NUMEROUS CONTROVERSIES HAVE erupted in Ireland since the beginning of the conflict in Israel and Gaza over claims about breaches of international law and possible war crimes.
A minor diplomatic spat occurred last weekend after Israel’s ambassador to Ireland, Dana Erlich, took issue with comments by President Michael D Higgins that Israel hadbroken international lawby bombarding Gaza.
Former Web Summit CEO Paddy Cosgrave also apologised andlater resignedfollowing a tweet he sent referring to possible “war crimes” by Israel.
The country has faced criticism from the UN and international groups for its ongoing bombardment of the densely populated Gaza Strip, where thousands of civilians have been killed in recent weeks.
Israel, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also accused Hamas – the Islamic militant group who are deemed a terrorist organisation and who control the Gaza Strip – of committing war crimes in their initial attack on 7 October.
The group killed at least 1,400 people on the day it launched its offensive, most of them civilians, and has also been criticised for taking over 200 hostages – including women, children and older people – back to Gaza, where most are still being detained.
International law does define what war crimes are – but could either side be said to have committed such crimes in the current conflict?
Speculation about possible war crimes is almost a given during modern conflicts, but the concept has only existed in an international sense for three quarters of a century.
“Since the beginning of war, in many cases, victorious powers have prosecuted their defeated enemies and sometimes the concept of war crimes was used,” says Professor Shane Darcy, a senior lecturer at the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the University of Galway.
“But in an international sense, it was a concept that was devised in order to hold the Axis powers to account effectively [after World War Two].”
Towards the end of the Second World War, Allied powers sought to prosecute German military and political leaders, as well as the Japanese, and devised crimes based on international law as it existed at the time.
The result was the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which set down specific war crimes and laid down rules about who is and isn’t considered a combatant, and how to legally safeguard combatants, prisoners of war (POWs), and civilians.
In the decades since, various other conventions have expanded on the original set, including the Rome Statute which established the International Criminal Court in the late 1990s, but the concept has broadly remained the same over time.

War crimes are criminal offences that violate what is known as international humanitarian law – a strand of international law that aims to limit the effects of wars for humanitarian reasons and which lays out things like how POWs should be treated.
“War crimes include serious or grave violations of the laws of war,” explains Clive Baldwin, senior legal adviser at Human Rights Watch.
“They can include deliberately attacking civilians, including hostage-taking with criminal intent and imposing collective punishment on the population.”
Other examples of war crimes include murder, torture, rape or other sexual offences, killing POWs, and the conscription of children under the age of 15 into armed forces.
According to the United Nations, war crimes must “always take place in the context of an armed conflict”, but can differ from genocide and crimes against humanity, which do not always take placed during times of conflict.
Every country in the world is a party to the Geneva Conventions, but the concept of war crimes are individually focused; this means that states themselves aren’t prosecuted, but people who may be acting on their behalf can be.
“The state can be held responsible in different ways for violations of international law, but the criminal aspect is generally focused on individuals,” Darcy explains.
In a conflict situation, however, defining what constitutes a war crime can be tricky: not every civilian death at the hands of a combatant is necessarily a violation of international humanitarian law.
International humanitarian law is therefore based ona number of key principleswhich consider military necessity during an armed conflict against the need to allow for the protection of non-combatants.
Combatants must be distinguished from civilians and only other combatants may be directly targeted, which is known as theprinciple of distinction.
Direct attacks on civilians or civilian infrastructure is therefore considered a war crime, as is the use of weapons – possibly including nuclear bombs – which do not allow civilians or civilian infrastructure to be distinguished from military combatants or targets.
Another principle, known as theprinciple of proportionality, demands that a minimal amount of harm must be caused to civilians or civilian infrastructure.
This means that combatants must avoid deliberately killing or injuring civilians, or damaging infrastructure, in pursuit of military goals.
For example, armed groups must not set up near civilian infrastructure if they know that they’re going to be attacked; nor can armies attack places where they believe large numbers of civilians are likely to be.
Indiscriminate attacks where there is no attempt to distinguish between civilians or military objectives is also considered a war crime.
Not every civilian death is a war crime, but attacking places such as hospitals, bakeries or civilian homes is unless there is a military objective (which must also be proportionate).
When it isn’t possible to avoid harming civilians or civilian infrastructure, the damage is required to be proportional to advantage gained; if it is not, that would also be considered a war crime.
But an act that is deemed proportionate is often subjective, which can be unhelpful.
“There is a certain amount of ambiguity in there that is problematic when you’re talking about military objectives and civilian objects,” Darcy says.
“It’s a reflection of international humanitarian law as something that was devised by states and military powers who came together to draft these rules, but who didn’t want to completely tie their hands.”
The principle of proportionality also applies only when a military target is attacked: an attack on civilians alone would constitute a violation of international humanitarian law that cannot be justified.
Another principle,theprinciple of precaution, states that precautions must be taken to protect civilians ahead of any attacks.
This can include advance warnings to give people time to clear an area that may come under attack – but crucially, the principle explicitly states that “all feasible precautions” should be taken; it is not enoughjustto give advance warning of an attack.

Claims about what constitutes a war crime and who has committed them in Israel and Gaza continue to shape how the conflict is reported.
Last week, accusations of war crimes were made against both Hamas and Israel followingan explosion at the al-Ahli hospital in Gaza– with uncertainty still surrounding who exactly was responsible despite numerous Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigations by several international newsrooms.
At home, a misunderstanding over the principle of precaution is what caused the diplomatic spat between President Michael D Higgins and Israel’s ambassador to Ireland, Dana Erlich.

Remarking on Israel’s bombardment of Gaza last week, Higgins said that “to announce in advance that you will break international law and to do so on an innocent population [...] reduces all the code that was there from second world war on protection of civilians”.
However, ambassador Erlich claimed at the weekend that this was “misinformation”.
In an interview with the Sunday Independent, she said that Israel had not broken international law precisely because it had given advance notice to civilians in Gaza before it carried out airstrikes.
“Announcing beforehand — that is not breaking [international law], that is in accordance with international law,” she told the newspaper.
“We want to make sure that there are as few civilian casualties as possible.”
To date, Israeli forces have launched thousands of airstrikes since beginning its latest operation in the Gaza Strip.
The Gazan Ministry of Healthsay these have killed over 5,000 people and injured over 15,000 more- a figure which Hamas says it has tallied from hospital directors, and is generally used by international news outlets despite an inability to independently verify it because foreign media and observers have been unable to access the Gaza Strip since the conflict began.
There are major questions about the extent to which Palestinian civilians were sufficiently warned about these strikes.
On 13 October, the Israel Defense Forcesordered all those livingin northern Gaza – more than 1 million people – to evacuate to the south of the enclave within 24 hours.
Israel may argue that this was sufficient notice and that the subsequent airstrikes in Gaza served an immediate military need – the defeat of Hamas, which it aims to do in response to the 7 October attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel.
But there may be questions about whether the evacuation order amounted to taking “all feasible precautions” to avoid civilian casualties, which is required under the principle of proportionality.
The order was criticised at the time by foreign governments and agencies including the UN and the Red Cross, in part because it was believed that a 24-hour notice period was far too short a time to facilitate the movement of citizens.
“It is inconceivable that more than half of Gaza’s population could traverse an active war zone, without devastating humanitarian consequences, particularly while deprived of essential supplies and basic services,” Paula Gaviria Betancur, special rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons,said at the time.
Aside from the feasibility of asking more than one million people to leave a large area within 24 hours, others have raised questions about whether the bombardment of civilian targets in Gaza by Israel could also constitute a war crime.
Amnesty International said last weekthat it is investigating air strikes on residential buildings, a refugee camp, a family home and a public market, claiming that there is no evidence that fighters were present or that the infrastructure had any other military objective.
The group also said that the Israeli military did not give Palestinian civilians adequate warnings before the strikes, and that in some cases it did not warn civilians at all.
“In their stated intent to use all means to destroy Hamas, Israeli forces have shown a shocking disregard for civilian lives,” Amnesty International’s secretary general Agnès Callamard said.
Israel has also carried out aerial bombardments in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, a location that was not mentioned in the evacuation notice on 13 October.
On Tuesday,UN chief Antonio Guterressaid that the 7 October attacks could not justify “the collective punishment of the Palestinian people” (though he also criticised Hamas for using civilians as “human shields”).
Israel’s foreign minister to the UN Eli Cohen dismissed calls for “proportionality” and said the only proportionate response to the attacks was “a total destruction to the last one of the Hamas”.
“Tell me, what is a proportionate response for killing of babies, for rape (of) women and burn them, for beheading a child?” he asked.
“How can you agree to a ceasefire with someone who swore to kill and destroy your own existence?”

Aside from airstrikes, human rights groups have suggested that the treatment of Gaza during the conflict could also amount to a breach of international law.
During the first week of the conflict, Gaza’s only power plant ran out of fuel, leaving civilians across the enclave without electricity and the shutting down of its seawater desalination plants, resulting in a lack of drinking water.
“Israel has imposed collective punishment on the population of Gaza – the cutting off of all electricity, fuel, water – which is also a war crime,” Human Rights Watch’s Clive Baldwin says.
However, both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also accused Hamas of committing war crimes.
“The massacre by Hamas and other armed groups of Israeli civilians was a war crime, one that was clearly intended to attack and kill civilians. So was the hostage-taking, where there was a clear intent and which was a clear crime,” Baldwin added.
Amnesty International likewise criticised the group for hostage-taking, as well as for ongoing rocket attacks on Israel.
“[We are] calling on Hamas and other armed groups to urgently release all civilian hostages, and to immediately stop firing indiscriminate rockets,” Agnès Callamard said.
Under international humanitarian law, it is possible to prosecute war crimes when the law is broken, though it is not necessarily straightforward to do so.
International tribunals have successfully prosecuted individuals for committing war crimes during civil wars in Rwanda, Sierra Leone and the former Yugoslavia.
But because prosecutions are focused on individuals, who may be national leaders (as commanders-in-chief), military leaders or a country’s own soldiers that have acted on behalf of their country, states can be reluctant to progress investigations.
When it comes to what’s happening in Gaza, crimes could be tried at the International Criminal Court in The Hague in the Netherlands, which has jurisdiction over war crimes committed in Palestine because the State of Palestine is a member of the court.
“It’s clear that those can include attacks from Gaza, because rockets have been fired at civilians, as well as Israeli attacks in Gaza,” Baldwin says.
In theory, a prosecution could also take place via a country’s domestic legal system because the Geneva Conventions says that it doesn’t matter where a crime was committed.
“Maybe it could happen at a domestic level, maybe in court martial system if it’s a member of the armed forces, or maybe it could appear before domestic criminal courts if it involves civilian practices or a civilian from another country,” Professor Shane Darcy of the Irish Centre for Human Rights says.
However, he adds that bringing charges would be complex because of the process involved.
“It’s difficult to prosecute war crimes because of the context about getting access to information, evidence, and witnesses.
“Historically, there been a bit of an insufficient approach because domestically, states tend not to prosecute individuals and there are challenges in criminal trials when crimes might have taken place outside of the country. That remains a big issue.”
The basic principles of international humanitarian law could also hinder any potential prosecution, because of their subjective nature.
What is deemed a proportionate response or how much precautions were taken to avoid civilian casualties are not black-and-white, and may be judged by those more favourable to one side.
If both are weighed up in terms of Israel’s actions, the country’s Western supporters, like theEuropean Unionand theUnited States, might ultimately help to sway opinion in its favour.

"Doctor 
 'I have lived through many wars in Gaza - this one is different - we've lost so many'","With no fuel left to run his car, Dr Hassan has been cycling across Gaza to give vital medicine and first aid to his patients despite the constant bombardment by Israel since the October 7 Hamas attack.He carries out these duties even though he has been displaced himself and is now living with his family in a small shipping container.
The doctor runs the chronic disease centre for Christian Aid’s local partner Palestinian Medical Relief Society (PMRS), but since the start of the current crisis, he has also been working with PMRS’ mobile health team, which delivers medicine and carries out home visits to change dressings for the wounded.Here he describes his vital work as well as detailing the worsening situation facing Gaza’s nearly depleted health service:
DURING THE FIRST days of the war, the area where I live was bombed and there was a lot of damage to the windows and the doors of my house. I decided to leave and moved to central Gaza with my family. My wife, my five children, my sister and her child are now sleeping in a shipping container. I am sleeping outside in my car.
My car has no fuel so I travel about 15km by bicycle to get to Gaza City for work. It takes me about one and a half hours to get there. I’m 54 years old, so it’s not easy for me to ride my bicycle for so long at my age.
My journey is very dangerous. I cycle as much as I can along the beach to avoid roads and buildings as they are being hit by bombs. But even this route isn’t safe, as sometimes rockets come from military ships too. Whenever the roads have been bombed I have to carry my bicycle on my back to get past the debris.

The mobile health team are treating injured people who have been discharged from overcrowded hospitals. We follow up with them through home visits. The team deals with 30-35, sometimes, 40 cases a day. They are visiting them at home, dressing their injuries, sometimes giving them antibiotics and taking care of the children if they are sick.
Children I treat for diabetes are now sheltering in UNRWA run schools. It’s getting colder now, so a lot of the children in the shelters have coughs and bad colds. They are deteriorating very fast as their immune systems are low because they are not eating enough food. These infections are much worse for children with chronic diseases, especially for those with diabetes.
We have a shortage of medicine. Sometimes we are using one bottle of cough syrup for three children. We try to bring them one bottle of antibiotics and the next day we try to find another, so they can complete the course. It’s very difficult. After I treat these children, I have about 10-15 other patients in Gaza City that I reach by bicycle.
The hospitals are crowded with civilians who are sheltering to escape the bombardment of their homes. They have no place to go, especially if the nearby schools are full. They are sleeping in between the beds of injured patients, which makes it difficult for health workers to do their jobs. But we can’t blame them and we can’t ignore them. Most of them are children with mothers, the men are staying outside.

In Al Quds hospital, some people are even sleeping next to the doors to the intensive care unit. This is very dangerous for the patients because of the risk of contamination. It is not easy to work in these conditions.

All the children’s hospitals are out of action now. They are not accepting any cases at all. They are trying to find fuel to continue their work. Without fuel for their cars, it’s impossible for families to bring their children to the hospital. If we can reach them, then maybe they will be OK. But if we can’t then there is no guarantee these children will live.
In the centre for chronic diseases, we support hundreds of patients with type 1 diabetes. They are the priority for us. Some of the insulin we have is administered in a pen. It can be kept at room temperature and doesn’t need a refrigerator. We also have some oral diabetes medications. Our other type of insulin needs to be kept in refrigerators, but since we have only two hours of electricity per day at our centre we gave it to the hospitals since they have generators, and they have been working, so they can help people.
I have lived through many wars in Gaza. But this war is not the same. We have lost a lot of doctors, nurses and hospital staff. Many healthcare workers have been killed by bombs and rockets hitting their homes.
If fuel totally runs out in Gaza, it will be a catastrophe. So many patients will die, especially those in intensive care units who are relying on ventilators, which will stop working without electricity. The hospitals will become a place where patients are only sent to the morgue. Fuel must be allowed to enter Gaza as soon as possible because I don’t think patients and hospitals can hold out much longer.

Divided Europe: Ireland's voice at the EU table not loud enough to be heard this time around,"IRELAND HAS A voice around the table at Europe, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar insisted to the media as he attended the two-day European Council meeting in Brussels.
Ahead of talks with other European leaders on the Israel-Hamas conflict, Varadkar had said Ireland’s plan was to call for more balanced language from the EU.
He also wanted the other leaders to call for a ceasefire in the three-week-old war.
Europe, however, is divided on the issue.
The 27-nation bloc is split between more pro-Palestinian members such as Ireland and Spain, and staunch backers of Israel including Germany and Austria.
Such divisions were even evident in the press corp at the council meeting, where Irish media were questioned by some of their German counterparts as to why Ireland was so invested in the Palestinian cause.
Standing on the long red carpet, facing into a scrum of cameramen, journalists and  microphones, Varadkar also answered questions posed to him from some of the international media.
One foreign correspondent mentioned United Nations General Secretary António Guterres, and how he had called for an immediate ceasefire. The EU often backed the position of the UN, he put it to Varadkar. So why not now?
Responding, the Taoiseach said he hoped the EU would, but then tempered expectations. Knowing all too well that it was a long shot, Varadkar said the EU might not use the same language as the UN.
However, going into the talks, Varadkar did appear optimistic.

“We do have voice at the table. And if it wasn’t for the European Union, the voice of a small country like Ireland wouldn’t count for an awful lot, quite frankly, on a European level.
“And the fact that we have a voice at the table, along with a number of other countries, I think will allow us to recentre the common European position to one that’s balanced, one that recognises Israel’s right to defend itself, but also the Palestinians’ legitimate right to seek to have their own state.”
However, fast forward five hours  to when the talks concluded and the agreed text from Europe was released. No sign of the word ceasefire.
In the end, it called for “humanitarian corridors and pauses” so aid can enter Gaza, but the statement fell short of demanding a “ceasefire”.
The focus among among the media covering the late night statement release was on the word ‘pause’.
The dictionary definition means: a short period in which an activity is stopped before starting again.
It was very clear once the statement was issued that Europe had not heeded Ireland’s calls.
Instead of a wider call for all sides to down arms, the call was for a momentary stop on bombardments to allow aid into Gaza. After the ‘pause’, one can only assume the bombing will continue.
Over the last couple of weeks, there is no denying that Europe has not shown a united front. The complete opposite, in fact.
Confusion about where Europe stood began with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen travelling to Israel and pledging Europe’s unwavering support for Israel. The Israeli flag was also adorned on the commission building in Brussels.
She subsequently appeared to walk back her comments somewhat, pledging aid to Gaza would increase threefold.
Speaking to sources, it is understood there was fury within the European institutions, with the issue being the hot topic of conversation at the heart of Europe, and questions being posed about her future and whether it had been damaged by her actions.

In what could be seen as a nod to her visit to Israel, von der Leyen said at last night’s press conference that it was “good that so many leaders travelled to Israel to listen”, while also conveying the need for Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October to be within international law.
Going into Thursday’s summit Varadkar said there was need to bear in mind and respect where other countries are coming from.
“You know, particularly countries” – Varadkar paused here – “that were involved in the terrible things that happened to Jewish people in the 1930s and 1940s. We need to understand where they’re coming from and why so many Jewish people had to return to Israel, their ancestral homeland, because of the events of the Holocaust.
“In Ireland we have a lot of sympathy for the Palestinian people, often driven by our own historical experience. But to get a consensus among 27 people we’re going to have to compromise, we’re going to have to understand each other.”
He pointed to how Europe has come along way – stating that there has been an evolving European position on the conflict.
“If you went back to three weeks ago, it appeared that the European Union was supporting Israel without any equivocation or qualification – that changed a week or so ago to continuing to support Israel’s right to defend itself but emphasising the supremacy of international law, humanitarian law, to yesterday, 27 countries calling for a pause to allow aid to get in and to allow citizens and hostages to get out. So I think you’re seeing an evolving position there,” said Varadkar.
However, while Europe is talking and ‘evolving’, the bombs continue to rain down on Gaza. The short-term question remains – will Europe find the will to call for a ceasefire in the coming weeks, as this conflict continues?
The answer was given by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on day two of the European Council meeting in Brussels today.
“It’s hard to predict. I think that is possible depending on how things develop on the ground.
“In some ways, I hope that doesn’t happen, because if the European Union got to the position that it was calling for a ceasefire. It probably would be after a lot more people have died and suffered in the region. So, hopefully in some ways it doesn’t come to that.
“But I think it is possible that that could be the position in a few weeks or a few months’ time, to answer your question.”

UN raises war crimes concerns over Israel-Hamas conflict,"LAST UPDATE|27 Oct 2023

THE UNITED NATIONS has expressed concern that war crimes were being committed on both sides in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.
The UN human rights office cited forcible transfer, collective punishment and the taking of hostages as the war continued into its 21st day.
“We are concerned that war crimes are being committed. We are concerned about the collective punishment of Gazans in response to the atrocious attacks by Hamas, which also amounted to war crimes,” spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a press conference in Geneva.
She said that it was for an independent court of law to qualify whether war crimes had been committed.
Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, kidnapping more than 220 others, according to Israeli officials.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip said the strikes have killed more than 7,000 people, mainly civilians and many of them children, leading to growing calls for protection of innocents caught up in the conflict.
Israel has cut supplies of food, water and power to Gaza, notably blocking all deliveries of fuel saying it would be exploited by Hamas to manufacture weapons and explosives.
Israel’s army called on people in the north of the Gaza Strip – nearly half of its 2.4 million population – to head south ahead of an expected ground offensive.
Israeli ground forces backed by fighter jets and drones carried out a night-time targeted raid in central Gaza Strip, the army has said, as it prepares for a land invasion.
“During the last day, IDF (Israel Defense Forces) ground forces, accompanied by IDF fighter jets and UAVs, conducted an additional targeted raid in the central Gaza Strip,” the army said in a statement.

“As part of the activity, IDF aircraft and artillery struck terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Shujaiya area and throughout the Gaza Strip.”
Concern is growing about the regional fallout from the conflict, with Washington warning Iran against escalation while striking facilities in Syria it says were used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and others.
Just 74 trucks of food, water and medicine have been permitted to enter Gaza, home to 2.4 million people, since the conflict began – a figure described by aid groups as vastly insufficient.
Before the conflict, around 500 trucks entered daily, according to the United Nations.
12 of the territory’s 35 hospitals have been forced to close, and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA has started to “significantly reduce its operations”.
“Without fuel, there will be no humanitarian response, no aid reaching people in need, no electricity for hospitals, no access to clean water, and no availability of bread,” UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said.
Israel defends its operations, with staunch backing from allies including Washington, and has demanded Hamas release 224 foreign and Israeli hostages it seized on 7 October.
The fate of the hostages remains a complicating factor for Israel’s planned ground operation.
Hamas’s armed wing said yesterday that “almost 50″ Israeli hostages had been killed in Israeli bombing raids, a claim that AFP could not verify.
Four hostages have been released, but for relatives of those left behind, the anguish continues.
“Our lives stopped,” said Moran Betzer Tayar, of the day her nephew and his wife were abducted.

She told a press conference in France she was “worried sick” and desperate to keep the fate of the hostages in the public eye.
Rights groups and international organisations have demanded the immediate release of hostages, who include women and children.
Inside Gaza, the punishing strikes have left people “with nothing but impossible choices” the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory said Thursday.
“Nowhere is safe in Gaza,” Lynne Hastings said in a statement.
Around 45% of all housing in Gaza has been damaged or destroyed, according to the UN, citing local authorities, and satellite images show vast swathes of destruction.
Rahma Saqallah fled south with her family, heeding Israeli warnings. But after strikes killed her husband and three of her children, she was heading back home.
Hamas yesterday released a list of almost 7,000 names of people it said had been killed in Israeli strikes, after US President Joe Biden cast doubt on the toll from the territory.
The list of 6,747 names gave the age, sex and identity card number of each victim, adding that 281 bodies had not yet been identified. Another 1,600 people, including 900 children, are missing and may be under rubble, according to the UN, citing local authorities.
The war’s surging death toll is by far the highest since Israel unilaterally withdrew from the coastal territory in 2005 – a period that has seen four previous Gaza wars.

"'Smell of death' pervades Gaza hospitals, says WHO's Mike Ryan","MEDICAL AID TEAMS have reported that there is a “smell of death” cast over stricken Gaza hospitals, according to the head of the World Health Organisation’s health emergencies programme.
The WHO’s Mike Ryan, an Irish public health expert, has described the current situation in Gaza as a “humanitarian and health catastrophe”.
12 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals have been forced to close and those that remain open are running with extremely limited medical supplies and fuel.
Thousands of people have been killed and injured by Israeli strikes in recent weeks.
Speaking to RTÉ’sPrime Time, Ryan said that the healthcare situation is “beyond belief”.
“66% of primary health care centres are closed. We’ve got many hospitals out of action and supplies are running low,” he said.

He said the civilians who have been injured and killed are “not combatants… these are ordinary human beings who are caught up in the most awful conflict”.
“Notwithstanding the terrible suffering of civilians in Israel, notwithstanding the hostages that have been taken and the people who have been affected, the reality is that what is now happening in Gaza is beyond. It is beyond belief.”
In terms of fuel, hospitals are “running on a trickle”, Ryan said.
“Anyone in Ireland can imagine what it would be like in Dublin or in Galway or Cork if the hospital shut down, if there was no electricity and no water and no food if there was no fuel,” he said.
“There are thousands of people sheltering at the hospital. The Al-Shifa Hospital alone has over 30,000 civilians sheltering on the grounds of the hospital.”
He said that WHO teams delivered more than 50 pallets of medical aid into Al-Shifa Hospital on Wednesday.
“Their report to me is that the smell of death, the smell of death in the place, is unreal,” Ryan said.
“It’s very hard to describe the reality for the civilians on the ground in Gaza. Very, very hard to put it into words.”

 Israel's diplomatic mission to Ireland has had a rocky few years","LAST UPDATE|26 Oct 2023
THIS WEEK, THE Israeli ambassador to Irelandaccused President Michael D. Higginsof spreading misinformation about Israel when he said the country was committing war crimes in Palestine. Her remarks attracted substantial criticism from across the political spectrum in Ireland.
This was followed by a tweet posted by the deputy ambassador in Dublin, which claimed Ireland was responsible for funding Hamas’s ‘tunnels of terror’. Following a backlash, the postwas quickly deletedwith the explanation that the ‘text and wording were wrong’.
In fairness to Ambassador Dana Erlich, she has only been in the job since August, and like all parties, she is navigating one of the most heated diplomatic crises in years. Israel is understandably hurting since the horrific attack by Hamas on 7 October.
Given some of the coverage, one could have been forgiven for thinking that this was a novel or unprecedented faux pas. However, Israel’s diplomatic mission in Ireland has a track record of posting provocative assertions on its social media and robust responses to criticism.
As the December holiday season in 2012 approached, the Israeli embassy in Irelandposted on its official Facebook pagean image of Jesus and Mary, accompanied by the text: ‘A thought for Christmas… If Jesus and mother Mary were alive today, they would, as Jews without security, probably end up being lynched in Bethlehem by hostile Palestinians. Just a thought…’
After the post went viral and attracted international media attention it was quickly removed. Moreover, the Facebook page was taken offline later that day, ostensibly for maintenance and returned with several potentially objectionable posts deleted.
One announcement posted by the embassy that remained on Facebook, complained of the ‘Irish biased one-sided media in favour of the Palestinian Industry of Lies and against Israel’. The post contained a linkto a clip from an Israeli satirical TV programme, which presented a man described as an ‘Irish news director’, sporting fake red hair and alternately referred to as ‘Drek O’Hara’ and ‘Turd O’Shitter’, confessing to manufacturing negative stories to discredit Israel.

In August 2013, Israel’s embassy in Irelandretweeted statementsthat the UN had ‘become a tool against Israel’ and that ‘Hitler couldn’t have been made happier’ with its performance, which were also quickly removed after protests.
Commenting on the embassy’s controversial social-media postings, theWashington Post claimedthat ‘international diplomacy requires restraint and calculation’ and that ‘neither is particularly well served by incendiary, racially tinged messages like those on Israel-in-Ireland Facebook page’.
A Dublin-based diplomat wasquoted in the Irish Timesas describing the Israeli embassy’s social media campaign as ‘hardly the way to win friends and influence people, particularly in a country where you know you already have an image problem’.
The controversial social media campaign only accelerated because of ‘Operation Protective Edge’ in 2014. During the offensive against Gaza, in which Israel killed 2,251 Palestinians, according tothe UN, the Israeli embassy in Dublin tweeted an image of Adolf Hitler superimposed on a Palestinian flagwith the words‘Free Palestine now!’.
In another image also distributed via the embassy’s Twitter account Dublin’s famous Molly Malone statuewas covered in a traditional Muslim long black headscarfwith the caption ‘Israel now Dublin next’.

Similar images depicted the Mona Lisa in Paris, Michelangelo’s David in Italy, and Copenhagen’s Little Mermaid in Muslim attire and heavily armed. All four photos contained the caption ‘Israel is the last frontier of the free world’. Following numerous complaints, the embassy removed the controversial images from its official Twitter feed.
When asked to explain the photos by theBritish Daily Telegraph newspaper, Israeli ambassadorBoaz Modaisaid he could not comment because ‘we are now in the middle of a war and I have other things to deal with’. The response to a similar query from theIrish Timeswas even more dismissive: ‘In view of the Irish Times’ extremely biased, partisan coverage of the current conflict between Israel and Hamas, inciting hatred of the Jewish State, the embassy will not comment.’
Asked in 2012 by Israeli military radio to describe Irish public opinion, the deputy ambassador at the Israeli embassy in Dublin, Nurit Tinari-Modai referred to ‘the mob’ which campaigned against Israel in Ireland. They weredescribed as‘ignorant, anti-Semitic, with an intensely rooted hatred of Jews’; she also argued that ‘under the disguise of caring for Palestinians they accuse Israel of crimes against humanity’.
Two years later, while still deputy ambassador to Ireland, Nurit Tinari-Modai was involved in a scandal regarding proposals she had sent in a diplomatic communiqué to Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As with the Irish ‘mob’, she again offered ablanket profile of Israeli human-rights activistswho campaigned for Palestinian rights:

In her communiqué, Tinari-Modai advocated intimidating andsmearingthese activists by disseminating their names and photos amongst their Israeli friends and family and by suggesting to Palestinians that they work for Mossad. Although the issue of this diplomatic cable was twice raised in theOireachtas, the Irish government declined to comment on the revelations.
Because of its record of promoting Palestinian rights, Ireland is frequently portrayed in a negative light in the Israeli media. A former Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson, Mark Regev,wrote a piece for the Jerusalem Postlast year entitled ‘Why does Ireland hate Israel?’.
A decade earlier, the same paper penned an editorial entitled ‘Irish Ire’, which concluded that Irish criticism of Israeli policy towards the Palestinians was simply thinly disguised anti-Semitism. Deriding ‘Irish officialdom’s pugnacious antipathy’, the paper said sarcastically that it could ‘only envy’ Ireland, which although geographically distant, ‘it appears to have no greater worry than the Israeli bogeyman’.
In 2010, Irelandexpelled a Dublin-based Israeli diplomatin protest against the use by the Mossad intelligence agency of several counterfeit Irish passports in the assassination of a senior Hamas figure in Dubai. Micheál Martin who, then as now, was Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that the investigation into the assassination had reached ‘the inescapable conclusion that an Israeli government agency was responsible’ and ‘the misuse of Irish passports by a state with which Ireland enjoys friendly, if sometimes frank, bilateral relations is clearly unacceptable and requires a firm response’.
The following year, sources within the Israeli Foreign Ministryclaimedthat Ireland was ‘pushing all of Europe’s countries to a radical and uncompromising approach… filling people with anti-Israel hatred…what we are seeing is clear anti-Semitism’. The Department of Foreign Affairs responded that Ireland was not hostile to Israel but rather critical of its policies in the occupied Palestinian territories and ‘these are not the same things’.
Citing official diplomatic assessments, theJerusalem Postsaid that with the election of the new Fine Gael–Labour government in 2011, which included Alan Shatter as Minister for Justice and Defence, Ireland’s warmth towards Israel, on a scale of one-to-ten, had gone from zero to 1.5. One suspects that this rating of the Irish position has not progressed much since then, if at all.
Both houses of the Oireachtaspassed motions in 2014calling on the government to recognise a Palestinian state and following a parliamentary vote in 2021, Ireland became the first EU country to declare that Israel is involved in the ‘de facto annexation’ of Palestine, a move rejected by the Israeli MFA as ‘outrageous and baseless’.
Official relations between Ireland and Israel have frequently been characterised as adversarial. Recent events suggest this is unlikely to change in the near future.

"EU leaders call for 'corridors and pauses' for Gaza, but fall short of demanding a 'ceasefire'","LAST UPDATE|26 Oct 2023
EU LEADERS HAVE reached an agreement calling for “humanitarian corridors and pauses” in the Israel-Hamas conflict, but falling short of demanding a “ceasefire”.
After five hours of talks at the European Council meeting in Brussels, the statement from the 27 member states says:
“The European Council expresses its gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and calls for continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs.”
The statement goes on to reaffirm its statement made on 15 October, condemning in the strongest possible terms the attacks carried out by Hamas on 7 October.
However, the use of the word “ceasefire” was not included in the statement due to some EU states contending that it weakened the EU’s support for Israel’s right to defend itself.
“The European Council strongly emphasises Israel’s right to defend itself in line with international law. It reiterates its call on Hamas to immediately release all hostages without any precondition,” says the statement that was agreed tonight.
It reiterates the importance of ensuring the protection of all civilians “at all times in line with international humanitarian law”.
“It deplores the loss of civilian life,” it adds.
The statement adds that the European Council “expresses its gravest concerns for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and calls for continued, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through necessary measures including corridors and paused for humanitarian needs”.
In addition, the council says it will work with partners to ensure aid such as water, fuel, food, shelter and medical card is made available to citizens  and is “not abused by terrorist organisations”.
It concludes by stating that the European Union stands ready to contribute to “reviving a political process on the basis of a two-state solution” and “supports the holding of an international peace conference soon”.
This was a late addition to the text — understood to be at Spain’s insistence.
European CouncilEuropean Council
Speaking at press conference after the meeting, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said council members agreed that Israel is a democracy that has been attacked by a terrorist organisation and it has a right to defend itself.
She said there was a “strong call” for Hamas to release all hostages, stating the terrorist acts of Hamas was “bringing harm to the Palestinian citizens and has caused a humanitarian crisis in Gaza”.

The commission president said it “all started with a horrible attack on the people of Israel”, adding that it is “important that we acknowledge the pain and suffering of the israeli people and families that lost relatives”.
If Europe wants to speak to Israel and use its influence, “it is so important you first listen if you want to be listened”, she said,
In what could be seen as a nod to her visit to Israel, one which drew a lot of criticism, von der Leyen said it was “good that so many leaders travelled to Israel to listen”, while also conveying the need to respond within international law.
“Of course leaders emphasised that siege must stop,” she said, adding it was of the utmost important that the Palestinian people and hostages have access to humanitarian aid.
“There is no contradiction between showing solidarity to Israel and of course acting on the need of humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza,” von der Leyen told reporters.
In terms of aid to the people of Palestine, she said 56 tonnes of aid had already been delivered and two more flights are scheduled for Friday, with more planned in the following days.
She said it was important to work with partners, particularly Egypt, stating that it needs to be a “beacon of stability in that region”.
The council also discussed how the crisis could impact on European security, stating that concerns were raised the spread of terrorist propaganda and the need for online platforms to remove such content.
Concerns were also highlighted about the rise in anti-semitic acts, she said, stating the EU leaders need to be “very vigilant of hate crimes”.
She added the commission’s proposal to add hate speech and hate crime to the list of EU crimes was agreed.
Charles Michel, President of the European Council, said at the press conference that the importance of the commitment to a two-state solution was emphasised as EU policy. He also raised the point of combating anti semitic speech, hate speech and islamophobia.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier today that he would be pushing for a humanitarian ceasefire to be called for.
“I believe it will be possible for us to come out of here tomorrow with a unified stance as a European Union,” he said in Brussels this afternoon.
“In Ireland we have a lot of sympathy for the Palestinian people, often driven by our own historical experience. But to get a consensus among 27 people, we’re going to have to compromise, we’re going to have to understand each other,” he said.
However, Varadar said that he was not hung up on the language that would be agreed along as it called for the end of violence.
“Even if we don’t all agree on emphasis and detail. I think it is possible to come to a position and that will then guide everything else thereafter,” said the Taoiseach.
The 27-nation bloc has long been split between more pro-Palestinian members such as Ireland and Spain, and staunch backers of Israel including Germany and Austria.

There has been strong condemnation of the Hamas attack that Israel says killed at least 1,400 people and resulted in more than 200 being taken hostage.
But there has been less consensus on urging any halt to Israel’s retaliatory bombardment of Gaza, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed over 7,000 people.

A question was posed to Varadkar this afternoon as to why in the past, the EU has always supported the UN’s calls, with one reporter questioning why this is so difficult now.
Varadkar had said he hoped the EU would follow the UN’s calls, stating that while Europe “might not use the exact same language as the UN uses”.
“I hope we will as a EU call for humanitarian ceasefire and pause. I am not obsessed with the language used, what we want is the killing and violence to stop, so humanitarian aid can get into Gaza where innocent  people are suffering,” he said.
Varadkar said he would tell the council meeting today how important it is the EU does not “play into the hands of Hamas”. He said Hamas wants to see an escalation and for it to spread to the wider regions.
“There are other people in other parts of the world that want to see that too, as it would take focus of Ukraine, so it is very important that we don’t fall into that trap,” he said.
Varadkar said today it is also important to respect where other countries are coming from on the issue. Earlier, theTaoiseach toldThe Journalthat he wouldn’t be berating other nations with Ireland’s view, stating that this meeting today is about building consensus.
Mentioning countries such as Germany and Austria, he said the historical past of the 30s and 40s and the treatment of the Jewish people has to taken into account in terms of their perspective, with the Taoiseach stating that Ireland’s own history colours our perspective on such matters.
Germany, wary of urging a more definitive halt that could tie Israel’s hands, have been arguing for the call to be humanitarian “windows” or “pauses” in the plural in the EU statement.
“We feel that civilians must be protected always and everywhere. We will have a good decision,” European Council chief Charles Michel said just ahead of the summit’s start.
Diplomats from some EU nations warn that delays over finding the right words as the death toll mounts are hitting the bloc’s global standing and leaving it flailing in the face of developments.
“We can feel that some in the world are using the circumstances to try to rally a part of the international community to attack the European Union,” Michel said.

"Hamas releases list of 7,000 names of Gazans killed since 7 October, as Biden rejects estimates","LAST UPDATE|26 Oct 2023

HAMAS HAS RELEASED a list of almost 7,000 names of Gazans it said had been killed in Israeli strikes after the US president cast doubt on its toll figures.
The Palestinian Islamist group says that 7,028 people have now been killed in Gaza since its October 7 attacks which Israel says left 1,400 dead, mainly civilians.
The Hamas list of 6,747 names, released by its health ministry, gave the sex, age and identity card number of each of the victims. It said 281 bodies had not yet been identified.
The ministry said in a statement that the United States had “brazenly cast doubt on the truth of the announced toll”.
“We have decided to announce the details of the names to the whole world so that the truth is known about the genocide perpetrated by the Israeli occupation against our people.”
US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he had “no confidence” in the militant group’s death toll figures.
Israel tanks, troops and armoured bulldozers into the Gaza Strip in a “targeted raid” overnight that destroyed multiple sites before withdrawing from the Hamas-run territory, the army has said.
Black smoke billowed into the sky after a blast in the grainy night-vision footage the military released hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared preparations for a ground war were underway.
On the 20th day of Israel’s deadliest Gaza war yet, that has already killed thousands, the army said its forces had hit “numerous terrorist cells, infrastructure and anti-tank missile launch posts”.
The operation in northern Gaza came in “preparation for the next stages of combat”, it said.
The black-and-white video showed a column of armoured vehicles moving near Gaza’s border fence. Other footage appeared to show an air strike and buildings being struck with munitions, sending debris flying high.
Just hours earlier, Netanyahu had delivered a nationally televised address to Israelis still grieving and furious after Hamas’s bloody 7 October attacks, telling them “we are in the midst of a campaign for our existence”.
The war’s surging death toll is by far the highest since Israel unilaterally withdrew from the small coastal territory in 2005 – a period that has seen four previous Gaza wars.

Entire neighbourhoods have been razed, surgeons are operating without anaesthetic on some of the wounded, and ice-cream trucks have become makeshift morgues.
In chaotic scenes, volunteer emergency crew and neighbours have clawed, sometimes with their bare hands, through broken concrete and sand to pull out civilian casualties.
All too often they recover only their corpses, which have piled up, wrapped in blood-stained white shrouds.
“Nowhere is safe in Gaza,” said Lynne Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories.
Israel has cut off Gaza’s normal supply corridors for water, food and other necessities, and fewer than 70 relief trucks have entered the impoverished territory since the war began.
The UN says 12 of the territory’s 35 hospitals have closed due to damage or insufficient fuel, and its UNRWA agency for Palestinian refugees said it “began to significantly reduce its operations”.
More than 90% of medicine stocks and supplies have been depleted, according to Mohammed Abu Selmeya, head of Gaza City’s Shifa hospital.
The Palestinian Authority’s foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, denounced Israel’s Gaza offensive as a “war of revenge” a day after meeting members of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
Representatives of Hamas and Iran are in Moscow today for talks, Russia’s foreign ministry said.
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Iranian deputy foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani was in Moscow and confirmed reports that a Hamas delegation was in the Russian capital.

US President Joe Biden, a strong supporter of Israel, has joined the calls for it to “protect innocent civilians” and to follow the “laws of war” as it pursues Hamas targets.
Leaders of the EU were today debating whether to call for a “humanitarian pause” in the war to deliver desperately needed aid.
French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking in Cairo yesterday, warned that “a massive intervention that would put civilian lives at risk would be an error”.
Egypt’s Abdel Fattah al-Sisi also urged Israel “to avoid a ground invasion”.

And Jordan’s King Abdullah II said anger at the suffering could “lead to an explosion” in the Middle East.
Representatives from Israel and Arab countries exchanged sharp accusations today at the UN General Assembly, as the body discussed the conflict following the Security Council’s failure to take action.
The matter has exposed deep divisions in the Security Council, with a total of four resolutions gaining insufficient traction or being blocked by a veto in less than two weeks.
Arab countries are hoping that the General Assembly, which has a different power balance and where no country holds a veto, will be able to act, even if any resolution would be nonbinding.
But the back-and-forth today remained heated, with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, who spoke on behalf of 22 Arab countries, accusing Israel of “making Gaza a perpetual hell on Earth.”
“The trauma will haunt generations to come,” he said, adding that “the right to self defense is not a license to kill with impunity. Collective punishment is not self defense, it is a war crime.”
“To stop this madness, you have a chance to do something, to give an important signal. Choose justice, not vengeance,” said Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour.
Jordan has circulated a draft resolution that is still under discussion, which is meant to be put to vote tomorrow.
The text focuses largely on the humanitarian situation, calling for an “immediate ceasefire” and “unhindered humanitarian access” to the Gaza Strip.
It also calls on all parties to comply with the “protection of civilians,” but makes no mention of the Hamas attack.
Israeli UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan blasted the text.
“The drafters of the resolution claim to be concerned about peace,” he said. “Yet the depraved murderers who initiated this war are not even mentioned in the resolution.”
“The only place this resolution belongs is in the dustbin of history,” he added.

'I don't plan on raising it again': Varadkar rules out speaking to von der Leyen about Israel comments at EPP summit,"LAST UPDATE|26 Oct 2023
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he won’t berate other nations into seeing Ireland’s position on the Israel-Hamas conflict, stating today’s European Council meeting in Brussels is about trying to build a consensus on a ceasefire.
Speaking toThe Journalbefore the European People’s Party (EPP) Summit in Brussels this morning, Varadkar also confirmed that he will not be raising any further concerns with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about her trip to Israel after the 7 October attacks where she pledged Europe’s unwavering support for Israel.
“I discussed that with Ursula already, so I don’t plan to raise it again. My main focus really here at the EPP Summit and then also later on at the European Council is for the European Union as one to agree to call for a humanitarian ceasefire.
“And we don’t have unanimous support for that at the moment. I don’t really mind what language is used. I think it’s important that the fighting should stop and that humanitarian aid get into Gaza, and that the US citizens and other foreign passport holders should be allowed to leave. Protecting our citizens is really, really significant and important for us. So that’ll be the focus,” he said.
Varadkar, her EPP colleague, stated last week that he believed some of her comments “lacked balance”.
It is expected that the controversy will be raised at the EPP Summit today, where party leaders and heads of state are in attendance alongside the likes of Varadkar and von der Leyen.
As president of the European Commission von der Leyen was fast to pledge support to Israel, despite concerns that the country’s response to the 7 October Hamas attacks would have catastrophic impacts for Gaza’s civilian population.
“The European Union stands with Israel,” she wrote on X, formerly Twitter, the day Hamas attacked civilians and captured hostages, alongside a picture of theEuropean Commission headquarters lit up with the Israeli flag.
As events in the Middle East continued, the United Nations and others warned that Israel’s siege of Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack amounted to an illegal act under international law.
On 13 October von der Leyen and Metsola visited Israel to express solidarity.
But by the following day von der Leyen appeared to be feeling the pressure, issuing her first statement to acknowledge the threat to Gaza’s civilians. In it she announced that the EU would be tripling its humanitarian aid.
“There is no justification for Hamas’ heinous act of terror,” she wrote in a social media post. “Israel has the right to defend itself. At the same time civilians in Gaza are also victims of Hamas.”
The majority of Irish MEPshave accused the Commission President of overstepping her mandate.
It is expected to be a tense couple of days for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Brussels, with Ireland seen as somewhat of an outlier among EU states Europe in terms of its position on Palestine.
However, he said that Ireland has a unique perspective on the issue of peace agreements, stating we have to move from position of conflict to a new peace initiative.
“I know that may seem unrealistic now. But we know from our history (in Ireland), that peace is possible. And that’s part of the message I’ve been bringing here,” he said ahead of an EU summit of the leaders of the 27.
Reaching agreement on the terms of a ceasefire call and communiqué could be difficult, he conceded: “We’re not a federation. We’re not a super state.
“We’re a European Union of 27 member states. And different countries have different opinions and different views. We work together very successfully when we can — look at the Eurozone, look at the Single Market. Look at how Brexit was handled, how we dealt with the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

Varadkar said there is a need to understand the origin of Germany and Austria’s strong support for Israel and also be aware that Hamas is an Islamic resistance movement.
“There are lots of countries that have experienced very serious, extreme Islamic related attacks,” he said.
“I’m not going to be berating people,” the Taoiseach added
“What I am going to be trying to achieve is a consensus EU position that calls for a ceasefire, calls for the fighting to stop, so that we can get aid in and maybe potentially even begin talking about peace again and the long term solution,” he said.
While the overall aim for the Taoiseach is for the EU to call for a humanitarian ceasefire, Varadkar said “we’re not going to put a timeframe on it. We’re realistic in that”.
“It may be the case that Hamas isn’t willing to observe a ceasefire, you know, how can you expect one side to observe a ceasefire and not the other. So that needs to be borne in mind. If there is a ceasefire, all parties in this conflict have to abide by it or it won’t last,” he said.
Varadkar said while Israel has a right to defend itself and to pursue terrorists that attack its civilians, how it does so is really important.
Ireland does have a voice at the table, he maintained, stating that the Irish government hopes to “recenter the common European position to one that’s balanced, one that recognises Israel’s right to defend itself, but also the Palestinians legitimate right to seek to have their own state”.
Sinn Féin has called on the Taoiseach to be the voice of the Irish people at today’s council meeting over the next two days.
Ahead of the meeting today, Sinn Féin has said that Varadkar must use his voice at European level to urge member states to follow the lead of UN Secretary General, António Guterres.
The UN chief this week expressed deep concern at “the clear violations of international humanitarian law”, calling Israel’s constant bombardment of Gaza and the level of destruction and civilian casualties “alarming”.
He called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to deliver desperately needed food, water, medicine and fuel. He also appealed “to all to pull back from the brink before the violence claims even more lives and spreads even farther”.
His comments resulted in Israel’s ambassador to the UN calling for Guterres’ resignation.
Sinn Féin spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, Matt Carthy, called on the Taoiseach to call for the EU to change course in its approach to the conflict, stating that Guterres’ words should be heeded.
“Regrettably, the strength of his calls have not been matched from within the EU.
“In fact, the European Union, which has long championed itself as a leader for peace, international law and conflict resolution, has failed to live up to any of those principles in recent weeks.
“This week’s European Council meeting can be the opportunity to change course. Ireland must be the voice at EU level that condemns war crimes regardless of who commits them,” said Carthy.
In making calls for a ceasefire, it may be that the Irish government will be in a minority on the European Council, Carthy pointed out. However, Varadkar will represent the views of the vast majority of the Irish people, added the Sinn Féin TD.
Pressure is also on Varadkar to highlight Irish concerns regarding von der Leyen at the EPP Summit today.
Irish MEPs have already criticised von der Leyen, while over 800 staff from EU institutions also penned a letter criticising her and pointing out she did not have a mandate to make such comments.

While Sinn Féin has called on Varadkar to use his voice at the European Council meeting, Independent Donegal TD Thomas Pringle told the Dáil last night that von der Leyen’s position should be discussed.
He called for her to resign from her position as President of the European Commission immediately, stating that she was justifying Israel’s horrific decision to cut off food, water and electricity to civilians in Gaza.
“President von der Leyen massively overstepped the mark and her actions are not only unacceptable but also unforgivable and extremely dangerous.
“She cannot be allowed to continue in her role as President of the European Commission.  In fact, she cannot be allowed to represent the EU in any form any longer. She does not represent Europe as a whole and she certainly does not represent Ireland.”
Speaking in the Dáil yesterday ahead of travelling to Brussels today, the Taoiseach said the European Union does not have a single foreign policy, and when it comes to Israel and Palestine it can be very difficult to find consensus.
“We were able to agree compromise language and that was the basis of the European Council statement the weekend before last.
“We will try to do the same over the course of the next two days. I am sure that on Thursday or Friday in Brussels we will discuss cooperation with Israel.
“At the moment, as we all know, there is very strong support for Israel from most EU member states but that could change. That will depend on how Israel acts in the coming weeks and months.”
Highlighting the words of US President Joe Biden, where he described the events of 7 October in Israel as the Israeli people’s 9-11, Varadkar said the point being made is that Israel should not make the same mistakes the US made.
“It is very clear what he meant because the US made terrible mistakes after 9-11, which caused a lot of hurt in a lot of parts of the world and impacted on its influence.
“The point President Biden was making to Israel, if you read between the lines, was a message of restraint and is one we will be making as well.
“Regarding international law, our view as the Irish Government is that collective punishment that deliberately targets civilians and civilian infrastructure is a breach of international humanitarian law no matter who does it.
“We have been very clear and consistent on that. I cannot speak for the President of the European Commission or other member states, and nor would I, but I understand that other member states come from different perspectives.”
Because of the Holocaust, “a lot of countries feel historic guilt because of their involvement in that. We have to understand that”, Varadkar added.
The Taoiseach said it is a valid suggestion that Ireland would try to build an international alliance that looks for a ceasefire first and a peace initiative later.
However, he said to have any influence we cannot take absolutist positions.
“Once you take an absolutist position your influence is gone, unless you have other forms of power. You cannot be an honest broker in that kind of scenario.”

Taoiseach: Safety of the 300 Irish troops in the Lebanon region is a 'paramount concern',"LAST UPDATE|26 Oct 2023
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said the safety of the 300 Irish troops in the Lebanon region is a “paramount concern”.
His comments come as Irish citizens living in Lebanon wereurged last nightto leave the country, which shares a border with Israel, and to cancel any plans to travel there.
Speaking toThe Journalon the way into the EPP Summit in Brussels, Varadkar said while safety is a concern, the troops also have a mission to discharge over there.
“They know that, they know that when they volunteer for these missions that there is a degree of risk but of course their safety is going to be of paramount concern,” he said.
When asked if it is expected that they will be engaging in any gunfire, Varadkar said the short answer is no.

He said they are there as for a peace keeping mission, not a peace enforcement operation, and therefore wouldn’t be involved in any active combat, stating that UNFIL missions have particular terms and conditions on such matters.

Meanwhile, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said this morning that the call for Irish people to leave Lebanon is due to fears that further conflict could erupt “suddenly” in the region.
Speaking to reporters this morning, the Tánaiste said: “There have been Irish people living and working in Lebanon for quite a long time and our basic advice is that we do believe it would be wise to consider leaving Lebanon.”
“We said that with great regret but there is potential for regional escalation and we can see an increase in activity in the northern border,” he said.
“While there are commercial options available, it is our considered advice that people should really think about taking those commercial routes that are currently available but may not be available if anything sudden happens.

Hamas killed around 1,400 people in Israel in its unprecedented attack launched on 7 October, while Israel has killed around 5,700 people in Gaza in the weeks since.
In that time, members of Hezbollah – a militant group based on Lebanon – have exchanged fire with Israeli troops across the border between Lebanon and Israel.
Lebanon has been experiencing major problems with electricity and fuel shortages, shortfalls in medical supplies, and a tumbling of its currency as well as restrictions on financial transactions and ATM withdrawals.
The Department of Foreign Affairs has warned Irish citizens in Lebanon to exercise extreme caution and – in the absence of an Irish embassy in Beirut – to register with the embassy in Cairo in Egypt.

"Wife and children of Al Jazeera journalist killed in Gaza strike, network says","
THE FAMILY OF an Al Jazeera journalist have been killed in an Israeli strike on Gaza, the Qatar-based network said in a statement as war rages between Israel and Hamas.
Al Jazeera said the wife and two children of its Arabic-language channel’s Gaza correspondent Wael Al-Dahdouh were killed in a strike on the Nuseirat refugee camp in the Gaza strip.
“The Al Jazeera Media Network extends its sincere condolences and sympathy to our colleague Wael Al-Dahdouh on the loss of his family in an Israeli airstrike,” it said.
“The indiscriminate assault by the Israeli occupation forces resulted in the tragic loss of his wife, son and daughter, while the rest of his family is buried under the rubble.”

More than 220 people were taken hostage and are currently held in Gaza, Israel says.
Israeli strikes have killed more than 6,500 people in Gaza, a rise of more than 700 since Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
In images and footage run by Al Jazeera and shared on social media, Al-Dahdouh was shown mourning over the bodies of his wife and children at a hospital in Deir el-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip.
Al Jazeera said the family were staying in a temporary home after evacuating Gaza City following Israel’s warning for residents to move south as its forces intensified strikes targeting Hamas.
“This is the safe zone the occupation (Israeli) army was talking about,” Al-Dahdouh said on Al Jazeera.
The media organisation said “their home was targeted in the Nuseirat camp in the centre of Gaza, where they had sought refuge after being displaced by the initial bombardment in their neighbourhood”.
“Al Jazeera is deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of our colleagues in Gaza and hold the Israeli authorities responsible for their security,” it added.

The situation in Gaza
Earlier today, the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group held talks with senior Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad figures.
The war between Israel and Hamas, now in its third week, has killed 1,400 people in Israel and more than 5,700 Palestinians in Gaza.
In that time, Hezbollah members have been exchanging fire with Israeli troops across the Lebanon-Israel border.
The DFA warned Irish people in the region to “exercise extreme caution” and to put contingency plans in place to leave Lebanon as soon as possible.
As there is no Irish Embassy in Beirut, Irish citizens in Lebanon who have not already done so are advised to register with the Embassy of Ireland in Cairo.
The DFA said that the security situation in Lebanon remains unstable and could deteriorate without warning, “due to the events in Israel and the oPt, as well as economic and political crises, there is an increased risk of protests and demonstrations, which can quickly lead to violence.”
The Lebanese Lira has lost 90% of its real value and restrictions have been placed on financial transactions and ATM withdrawals.
Lebanon is also experiencing electricity and fuel shortages, leading to power outages. Pharmacies and hospitals report shortages of medicines and medical equipment.

Netanyahu will give 'answers' on Hamas lapses as Israel faces pressure over ground operation plans,"LAST UPDATE|25 Oct 2023

ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged for the first time that he would “have to give answers” for security lapses exposed in the deadly 7 October attacks by Hamas.
“We will examine in detail, we will get to the bottom of it,” said Netanyahu, who has faced a barrage of opposition and media criticism after Gaza militants breached Israeli border defences.
“The fault will be examined and everyone will have to give answers, including me. But all this will happen later,” the right-wing leader said in a televised address as the Israeli military prepares for a widely expected invasion of the Gaza Strip.
“As prime minister I am responsible for securing the future of the country,” he added.
Israel says 1,400 people, most of whom were civilians, died in the attacks.
Gaza’s Hamas government says that Israeli air and artillery bombing since 7 October have left more than 6,500 dead, including some 2,700 children.
With tens of thousands of Israeli troops massed at the Gaza border, Netanyahu said “we are raining down hellfire” with the air strikes and that “all Hamas terrorists are dead men walking – above ground, below ground, outside Gaza”.
“We are preparing the ground offensive,” Netanyahu said.
“I cannot say when, how or how many, nor all the elements that we are taking into account, of which most are not known to the public,” he added.
Israel has an army of about 165,000 and has called up 360,000 reservists, some on the Gaza border and others moved to the border with Lebanon, where the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement has been staging daily artillery attacks.
Israel is facing growing international pressure to rethink plans for a massive ground operation in Gaza where the Hamas-run health ministry says 700 people have been killed in 24 hours.
“A massive intervention that would put civilian lives at risk would be a mistake,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in Cairo after meeting Egypt’s Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who also warned a ground operation would cause “many, many civilian casualties”.
It would also “be unlikely to offer Israel long-term protection” and would be incompatible with respecting “international humanitarian law and the rules of war”, Macron said.
Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden said Wednesday that Israel has the right to respond to the 7 October Hamas attack but must do everything it can to protect civilians.
“Israel has to do everything in its power, as difficult as it is, to protect innocent civilians. It’s difficult,” he said.
Biden also called for an immediate end to Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank.
“That’s pouring gasoline on the fire,” he said. “They’re attacking Palestinians in places that they’re entitled, and… it has to stop now.”
The main UN aid agency in besieged Gaza has warned it will have to stop operations by the end of today because it is running out of fuel.
Alarm has grown about the spiralling humanitarian crisis in heavily bombarded Gaza where one doctor said he was forced to perform emergency surgery on the wounded without anaesthetic.
President Emmanuel Macron today said that France was sending a navy ship to support the Gaza Strip’s hospitals which are at risk of collapsing under Israel’s bombing.
The ship will “leave Toulon in the next 48 hours”, the French leader said during a joint news conference in Cairo with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
France will also send a planeload of medical equipment to Egypt to be transported into the war-torn Palestinian territory.

Israel has cut off impoverished Gaza’s usual water, food and other supplies, and fewer than 70 relief trucks have entered since the war started – “a drop of aid in an ocean of need”, warned UN chief Antonio Guterres.
Inside the battered Palestinian territory, Abu Ali Zaarab, whose family house in Rafah was bombed, charged angrily that “they’re not waging war on Hamas, they’re waging war on children… It’s a massacre”.
Tempers flared at the United Nations where Guterres decried the “epic suffering” in Gaza and the “collective punishment” of its 2.4 million residents, drawing a furious response from Israel.
“Mr secretary-general, in what world do you live?” replied an infuriated Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who recounted graphic accounts of civilians including young children killed in the deadliest single attack in Israeli history.
Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, called on Guterres to resign, writing on X, formerly Twitter, that the UN chief had “expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder”.
US President Joe Biden shared the concern that the aid lifeline is “not fast enough”.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said “food, water, medicine and other essential humanitarian assistance must be able to flow into Gaza” and that “humanitarian pauses must be considered for these purposes”.
Elsewhere, the Palestinian Authority’s foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki today met senior International Criminal Court officials.
Maliki’s flying visit to the world’s war crimes court in The Hague came a day after he deplored inaction by the UN Security Council to stop “massacres” in Gaza by Israel, which has retaliated for a massive attack by Hamas that largely killed civilians.
“Today, Dr Riyad al-Maliki… visited the ICC and held meetings with the President, the Prosecutor and the Registrar of the Court,” the ICC said in a statement.
The top Palestinian diplomat’s visit was not announced to the media, but in a video released by the ICC he can be seen shaking hands with the court’s president Piotr Hofmanski, chief prosecutor Karim Khan and registrar Osvaldo Zavala Giler before sitting down for a discussion.
The ICC has declined to comment on the details of Maliki’s visit.
Maliki however is set to give a statement tomorrow morning at a press conference in The Hague.
Chief prosecutor Khan’s office said earlier this month it was “continuously gathering information” in support of its probe into the Palestinian situation.
It opened a formal investigation in 2021 into the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, including alleged crimes by Israeli forces and by Hamas and Palestinian armed groups.
The prosecutor’s office “put in place a dedicated team to advance the investigation in relation to the situation in the State of Palestine, the first time a fully resourced team had been established in relation to this situation,” it said.
Set up in 2002, the ICC’s is the only global independent tribunal to probe the world’s worst crimes including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Israel, which is not a member of the ICC, has refused to cooperate with the probe or recognise its jurisdiction.
On the 19th day of Israeli air and artillery strikes and a near-total land, sea and air blockade of Gaza, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA warned operations are at breaking point.
“If we do not get fuel urgently, we will be forced to halt our operations in the Gaza Strip,” said the agency which provides aid to 600,000 displaced in Gaza, where many families have slept in the open.
Israel has refused to allow fuel shipments into Gaza, fearing Hamas will use it for weapons and explosives and accusing the militant group of stockpiling supplies in large tanks.
Aid groups have warned that more people will die if medical equipment, water desalination plants and ambulances stop running in Gaza, where the only power plant went offline weeks ago.
Patients are already being treated on the floors of hospitals overwhelmed with thousands wounded by bombing. The Red Cross has warned that hospitals, once the generators stop running, “turn into morgues”.
“We performed a number of surgeries on the wounded without anaesthetic,” said Ahmad Abdul Hadi, an orthopaedic surgeon working in the emergency room of Nasser hospital, Khan Yunis.

Aid agencies report that shelters and emergency tent cities are heaving under the weight of an estimated 1.4 million displaced – more than half the population of the 40km long coastal strip.
Air strikes have kept hitting Gaza, where Israel says it is targeting Hamas sites, including tunnels and munitions depots, but where many residential buildings have been reduced to rubble.
The Gaza war has sparked fears of a regional conflagration if it draws in more of Israels’ enemies – especially Iran-backed groups such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah which has already traded deadly cross-border fire with Israel.
Israeli strikes also killed eight soldiers early today in the south of Syria, another Iran ally, state media reported, in what the Israeli army said was a response to earlier rocket fire.
Blinken told the UN Security Council that Washington “does not seek conflict with Iran” but also warned that “if Iran or its proxies attack US personnel anywhere, make no mistake, we will defend our people, we will defend our security – swiftly and decisively”.
Hezbollah leader met with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad senior representatives in Beirut today to discuss how “to achieve real victory… in Gaza and Palestine” and stop Israel’s “brutal aggression”, a statement said.
Israel has meanwhile continued to mass tens of thousands of troops outside Gaza ahead of a ground offensive that has been anticipated for more than two weeks.
Military planners acknowledge it would mean difficult urban combat in a densely populated area latticed by tunnels and would imperil remaining civilians and the hostages.
“There are a lot of obstacles,” an Israeli soldier serving with the military engineering corps told AFP on condition of anonymity.
“The enemy is spraying rockets and other things that I cannot detail to prevent us from progressing.”

So far Hamas has released four hostages after mediation involving Qatar and Egypt, including Israeli Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, who later spoke of the “hell” of her abduction.
She recalled how gunmen raided her kibbutz home, threw her over the back of a motorbike and beat her as they raced back into Gaza, recounting that “they hurt me very much”.
She and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper were released on “compelling humanitarian” grounds, according to Hamas, and Lifshitz also said the hostages were treated well once they were being held in captivity.
Both of their octogenarian husbands are still in Gaza along with more than 200 other Israeli and foreign hostages.
In the West Bank, more than 100 Palestinians have been killed since 7 October, the health ministry has said.
Violence had already spiralled in the West Bank before the Gaza war, with the highest death toll in the Palestinian territory since at least 2005.
Many of the Palestinian deaths came in raids by Israeli troops, but there has also been a rise in violence between Palestinians and Israeli settlers which has seen civilians as well as fighters killed on both sides.
Since October 7, killings have surged in the West Bank, including annexed east Jerusalem, with the Palestinian death toll reaching 101 Palestinians, according to the Ramallah-based health ministry.
Over the same period, the Israeli military has reported one member of the security forces killed while taking part in a raid.

Israel accuses UN Secretary General of justifying terrorism with Hamas attack comment,"ISRAELI OFFICIALS HAVE expressed outrage after UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the deadly Hamas attack on southern Israel “did not happen in a vacuum”, calling his comment justification for terrorism.
Foreign Minister Eli Cohen cancelled a scheduled meeting with Guterres, while Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial centre, said the UN chief “failed the test”.
“I will not meet with the UN secretary-general. After the 7 October massacre, there is no place for a balanced approach. Hamas must be erased off the face of the planet!” Cohen posted on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, yesterday.
Israel’s envoy to the UN, Gilad Erdan, called for Guterres’ resignation, saying Israel must rethink its relations with the world body.
“We will refuse to grant visas to UN representatives. We have already refused to give one to Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths,” Erdan told Army Radio, accusing Guterres of justifying a slaughter. “It’s time to teach them a lesson.”
Israel has historically had tense relations with the UN, accusing it of being biased against it.
Yesterday Guterres addressed a special Security Council meeting on the Israel-Hamas conflict which was sparked by the militant group’s 7 October attack, which left at least 1,400 Israelis dead, and saw more than 220 taken hostage.
Israeli air strikes have destroyed large swathes of the Gaza enclave, leaving at least 6,500 Palestinians dead, including more than 2,700 children, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.

The UN chief told the council that he “condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel”.
“Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians – or the launching of rockets against civilian targets,” he said.
But his contextualisation of the attack created an uproar in Israel.
It was important, Guterres said, to acknowledge that “the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum”.
“The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence, their economy stifled, their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing,” he said.
Guterres tweeted today writing: “The grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the horrific attacks by Hamas. Those horrendous attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”
But Israel was not mollified.
Yad Vashem chairman Dani Dayan said in a statement: “The slaughter of Jews by Hamas on 7 October was genocidal in its intents and immeasurably brutal in its form.”
He said it tests the sincerity of world leaders who went to Yad Vashem and pledged “Never again”.
”Those who seek to ‘understand’, look for a justifying context, do not condemn the perpetrators, and do not call for the unconditional and immediate release of the abducted, fail the test. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres failed the test.”","4.58pm, 25 Oct 2023",,
UK Labour leader Keir Starmer meets Muslim MPs amid anger over his position on Gaza,"LAST UPDATE|25 Oct 2023
UK LABOUR LEADER Keir Starmer has met Muslim Labour MPs as he sought to see off a backlash over his on position on Israel and Gaza.
Labour sources described the meeting, which was attended by around a dozen MPs including at least one frontbencher, as “constructive” but it comes amid growing anger among the grassroots and some in the parliamentary party over comments made by Starmer on the escalating conflict.
In an interview with LBC after Hamas’s 7 October atrocity, Starmer suggested that Israel has the “right” to cut off power and water from Gaza.
But acknowledging the “distress” caused by the remarks, he subsequently sought to clarify his position, arguing that he did not mean to back the siege on more than two million Palestinians.
In a statement issued after today’s meeting, Starmer said that Labour backed calls – including the US and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak – for humanitarian pauses amid international concern about the fate of Palestinian civilians facing Israeli bombardment.
It is understood that Manchester MP Afzal Khan, the parliamentary chair of the Labour Muslim Network, was among those at the meeting.
Labour had sought to downplay the gathering as an informal one between Starmer and the MPs.
But it came as more than 150 Muslim Labour councillors urged Starmer and Rayner to back an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza, with his comments also sparking resignations from councillors.

In a letter, the councillors from areas including Barking and Dagenham, Birmingham, Bradford, Blackburn, Bolton and Glasgow, said the leadership had to work to end the “humanitarian disaster”.

“As Labour councillors elected to serve our constituents, the message we have been hearing repeatedly over the past two weeks is simple, people just want to end the bloodshed and the loss of innocent life,” they wrote.
“No nation, no people or community should have to endure collective punishment and the same should be the case for the Palestinian people.”
In a sign of unrest too from within the parliamentary party, frontbencher Yasmin Qureshi used Prime Minister’s Questions this afternoon to call the situation in Gaza “collective punishment” and ask Rishi Sunak: “How many more innocent Palestinians must die before this Prime Minister calls for a humanitarian ceasefire?”
A spokesman for Labour did not say whether Qureshi – shadow minister for women and equalities – would be disciplined, but told reporters: “If I heard the question correctly… she was asking the Prime Minister what were the conditions that would lead the Prime Minister to support a ceasefire. And that was the question she was asking.”
Meanwhile, the South Wales Islamic Centre accused Starmer of having “gravely misrepresented” its meeting with Muslim leaders over the weekend.
The Labour leader had shared images of the meeting on Sunday, saying he repeated calls for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and for water and power to be restored.
He said he was “questioned by members” and “made clear it is not and has never been my view that Israel had the right to cut off water, food, fuel or medicines. International law must be followed”.
But the centre apologised for the “hurt and confusion” caused by hosting Starmer.
“We wish to stress Keir Starmer’s social media post and images gravely misrepresented our congregants and the nature of the visit,” a statement said.
“There was a robust and frank conversation which reflected the sentiments Muslim communities are feeling at this time.
“Members of the community directly challenged Keir on his statements made on the Israeli Government’s right to cut food, electricity and water to Gaza, warranting war crimes, as well as his failure to call for an immediate ceasefire.”","1.53pm, 25 Oct 2023",,
"Ireland has 'no issue' with raising Israel-Hamas conflict with US, says Martin","IRELAND HAS NO issue with raising the issue of the Israel-Palestine conflict with the US, according to Tánaiste and Minister of Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin.
Speaking to reporters on the fringes of the Global Ireland Summit at Dublin Castle yesterday, Martin said Ireland has always engaged with the US on the Middle East.
When asked if Ireland would use the close relationship it has with the White House to put forward the Irish position for a ceasefire, Martin said the “US is urging restraint on Israel right now”.
He acknowledged that the US has historic ties with Israel, stating that in “America at the moment, the public is consumed by this issue”.

“So we have a particular stance here and perspective here, given our own history, America has in respect of its history, but all the evidence we have today is that America is urging restraint. America has been to the fore in trying to get humanitarian aid into Gaza.
“Perhaps America is in a more stronger position to push those issues with Israel, because it’s so close to Israel in some respects,” the Tánaiste said.
When asked if it is an uncomfortable discussion to have with the US side, he said:
“It’s not an uncomfortable discussion. They’re quite open in giving their perspectives.”
Martin added that in the past he has raised the conflict with Hilary Clinton when she was US Secretary of State.
During the last visit of US President Joe Biden to Áras an Uachtaráin, the Tánaiste said he raised the matter with the current Secretary of State Antony Blinken, stating they had a “very good informal discussion about it”.

What has held back any progress is the “absence of any sense of a political track for many years now”. Martin said there has been a mentality that it is never going to be solved.
Martin made the comments while attending the Global Ireland Summit, which is an annual gathering of leaders from across the public service, state agencies, and Ireland’s international diplomatic network from over 98 locations around the world.
The Global Ireland project is the Government’s initiative to double the scope and impact of Ireland’s global footprint in the period to 2025.

Israel's Gaza invasion delayed amid internal disputes and international pressure,"
ISRAEL HAS NOT launched a ground invasion of Gaza, a delay media reports and experts attribute to international pressure, political-military divisions and concerns over hostages.
Eighteen days after the deadliest attack ever launched into Israel by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas that rules Gaza, the Israeli military is relentlessly pounding the territory.
But apart from some relatively minor incursions, the much-vaunted land offensive has not been unleashed.
“There’s a crisis of confidence between (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu and the IDF (army),” noted editorial writer Nahum Barnea in the Tel Aviv-based daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“The government is having difficulties taking decisions that everyone agrees on about the top issues,” he wrote.
Blame
According to government and military sources cited by Barnea, “Netanyahu is angry at the generals and blames them for what happened” during what Israelis are calling “the October 7 fiasco”.
On that day, the country was left stunned after Hamas militants stormed across the Gaza border and went on a rampage that Israeli officials say has killed more than 1,400 people.
They also snatched more than 220 hostages in the worst-ever attack in Israel’s history, which has prompted a ferocious Israeli bombardment of Gaza which Hamas officials say has killed 5,791 people.

Unanimity has brought together the left and right wings of mainstream Israeli politics.
“Disputes over these operations are creating tensions, especially between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant,” wrote columnist Amos Harel in Tuesday’s left-leaning Haaretz daily.
State radio noted “dissent between the premier and senior ranks in the military”, with mutual accusations of failing to prevent the bloody attack by Hamas militants.
‘Disagreement’ over ground offensive
Commentators say the fact that official statements often mention convergence of views at the highest level means the opposite, revealing the artificial nature of a united front.
“The prime minister, the defence minister and the IDF chief of staff are working in close and full cooperation, around the clock, to lead the State of Israel to a decisive victory over Hamas,” said a communique on Tuesday from the Government Press Office.
“There is total and mutual trust between the prime minister, the defence minister and the IDF chief of staff; the unity of the goal is clear.”

Patrick Bettane, an intelligence specialist at Israel’s International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) think tank, confirmed “disagreement about a ground offensive”.
“But the fact that there are hostages being held in the Gaza Strip complicates everything,” he said.
“Israel is waiting to see how this problem can be resolved before it acts.”
Relatives of those seized and taken to Gaza have staged daily demonstrations outside Gallant’s home in Tel Aviv.
Akiva Eldar, an expert on Israeli politics, asserted that “after the emotions aroused by this terrible massacre, Bibi (Netanyahu) and the generals are starting to think differently”.
He said the presence in Israel of US military personnel was aimed at preventing any move that could mean the death of hostages, including Americans.
This, Eldar said, sheds new light on pledges by both Netanyahu and Gallant that Hamas will have been eradicated when the war is over.
‘Nice’ words
Nevertheless, army chief Herzi Halevi repeated overnight that his aim was the complete removal of Hamas and its leaders.
“We are well prepared for the ground operations in the south,” he told troops according to a statement released by an army spokesperson.
Political analyst Daniel Bensimon said: “Disagreement or not, it’s a fact that Americans and the Europeans are coming to Israel to caress it with honeyed words with the aim of preventing a ground offensive.”
Macron visit
French President Emmanuel Macron today became the latest foreign leader to visit the region and meet with Israeli premier Netanyahu.
“The international community fears a ground operation would spark a chain reaction that could engulf the whole region, and maybe even further afield,” Bensimon said.
Israelis have been touched by expressions of compassion and solidarity from several leaders to visit the country over the past two weeks, including US President Joe Biden who came on October 18.
Macron told Israelis they were not alone in the “fight against these terrorist groups” but cautioned against “enlarging this conflict”.
For Bensimon, “Biden and Macron say nice things.”
“But in the end they want to stop Israel from going into Gaza and prevent Iran from becoming involved” through the Shiite Hezbollah movement, its proxy in Lebanon, he said.

Israeli UN ambassador calls for resignation of UN chief after rejecting ceasefire,"ISRAEL’S UNITED NATIONS ambassador has called for the resignation of UN chief Antonio Guterres over his stance on the Israel-Hamas war during a tense diplomacy meeting in New York.
Gilad Erdan accused the secretary-general of having lost “all morality and impartiality”, taking issue especially with Guterres’s statement that it was important to recognise that “the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum”.
At the meeting, Israel vowed again to destroy Hamas, rejecting calls from the United Nations chief, the Palestinians and many countries at a high-level UN meeting for a ceasefire.
It also declared that the war in Gaza is not only its war but “the war of the free world”.
UN secretary-general Antonio GuterresPAPA
Foreign minister Eli Cohen also dismissed calls for “proportionality” in the country’s response to Hamas’s surprise attacks on Israel on October 7 which killed 1,400 people and has since seen more than 5,700 Palestinian deaths in the Gaza Strip.
Guterres address
UN secretary-general Guterres had opened the monthly meeting on the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict — which has turned into a major event with ministers from the war’s key parties and a dozen other countries flying to New York — warning that “the situation in the Middle East is growing more dire by the hour”.
The UN chief said the risk of the war spreading through the region is increasing as societies splinter and tensions threaten to boil over.
He called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to deliver desperately needed food, water, medicine and fuel. He also appealed “to all to pull back from the brink before the violence claims even more lives and spreads even farther”.
Guterres stressed that the rules of war must be obeyed.
He said the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify “the horrifying and unprecedented October 7 acts of terror” by Hamas in Israel and demanded the immediate release of all hostages.
But Guterres also stressed that “those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people”.
He expressed deep concern at “the clear violations of international humanitarian law”, calling Israel’s constant bombardment of Gaza and the level of destruction and civilian casualties “alarming”.
Protecting civilians “is paramount in any armed conflict”, he said.
Without naming Hamas, the UN chief stressed that “protecting civilians can never mean using them as human shields”.
Guterres also criticised Israel without naming it, saying: “Protecting civilians does not mean ordering more than one million people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself.”
‘Proportionate’ response
Israel’s foreign minister Cohen criticsed what was being asked of Israel.

“Tell me, what is a proportionate response for killing of babies, for rape (of) women and burn them, for beheading a child?” he asked. “How can you agree to a ceasefire with someone who swore to kill and destroy your own existence?”
He told the UN Security Council that the proportionate response to the October 7 massacre is “a total destruction to the last one of the Hamas”, calling the extremist group “the new Nazis”.
He added: “It is not only Israel’s right to destroy Hamas. It’s our duty.”
Cohen called the Hamas attacks “a wake-up call for the entire free world” against extremism, and he urged “the civilised world to stand united behind Israel to defeat Hamas”.
He warned that today it is Israel, and tomorrow Hamas and the attackers “will be at everyone’s doorstep”, starting with the West.
US proposal
The US is pushing for adoption of a resolution that would condemn the Hamas attacks in Israel and violence against civilians, and reaffirm Israel’s right to self-defence.
There were some expectations that it might go to a vote today, but diplomats said it was still being negotiated.
Earlier, the US laid out its stance thatit would not support a ceasefireas it would “only benefit” Hamas.
Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki demanded an end to the Israeli attacks.
“We are here today to stop the killing, to stop… the ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel, the occupying power, against the Palestinian civilian population,” he said.
“Over two million Palestinians are on a survival mission every day, every night.”
Under international law, he said, “it is our collective human duty to stop them”.
Al-Maliki warned that more attacks and killings and weapons and alliances will not make Israel safer: “Only peace will.”
“For those actively engaged to avoid an even greater humanitarian catastrophe and regional spillover, it must be clear that this can only be achieved by putting an immediate end to the Israeli war launched against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,” he said. “Stop the bloodshed.”
Death toll
The Hamas health ministry said at least 50 people were killed late today in a single hour of increased Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip.
Israel was stunned by the Hamas attack on southern communities in which it says Hamas killed more than 1,400 people and took more than 200 hostages. It is widely expected to launch a land invasion of Gaza.
Hamas says that Israel’s devastating air and artillery strikes have already killed 5,791 people in Gaza including more than 2,000 children and about 1,400 women.

White House says a full Gaza ceasefire would 'only benefit' Hamas,"
A FULL CEASEFIRE in Gaza would only help Hamas as Israel wages an air campaign against the militant group, but humanitarian “pauses” should be considered to let vital aid in, the White House said today.
The comments came as President Joe Biden said aid deliveries to the Palestinian enclave, under Israeli bombardment since the deadly Hamas attacks of October 7, were “not fast enough.”
“A ceasefire right now really only benefits Hamas,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told journalists.
The latest outbreak of violence in the region started on 7 October, when Hamas militants stormed across the border, killing over 1,400 Israeli civilians and seizing hundreds of hostages. Israel has  retaliated with relentless strikes on the Gaza Strip and a siege, cutting civilians off from water, electricity and food.
The UNhas reportedthat the death toll in Gaza has now surpassed 5,000. Many of those who have died are children, as Gaza has a very young population.
UN chief Antonio Guterres earlier today urged an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as European Union leaders were considering a call for a pause in the fighting.

Kirby said that while Washington opposed a full ceasefire, stoppages in the fighting to facilitate the delivery of aid was “something that ought to be considered.”

“We want to see all measure of protection for civilians and pauses in an operation is a tool and a tactic that can do that for temporary periods of time,” he said.
“It’s not the same as saying a ceasefire.”
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier asked the UN Security Council to support a new US-led resolution on the conflict that would back “humanitarian pauses” to let in aid but not a full ceasefire.
Biden said Monday that “talk” about any ceasefire could only start once all of the more than 200 hostages taken by Hamas in the attack were released.
Kirby meanwhile warned that while the United States had urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties, some were inevitable.
“This is war. It is combat. It is bloody, ugly and it’s going to be messy and innocent civilians are going to be hurt going forward,” Kirby said.
“I wish I could tell you something different and wish that there wasn’t going to happen, but it is going to happen. And that doesn’t make it right, doesn’t make it dismissible.”
Israel was left stunned and furious by the bloody attack on southern communities in which it says Hamas killed more than 1,400 people and took the hostages, including some Americans.
Israel has responded with heavy air and artillery strikes that have killed 5,791 in Gaza, according to the Hamas-ruled health ministry, and plunged the Palestinian territory into a dire humanitarian crisis.

Explainer: Here is what we know about the Israeli hostage situation in Gaza,"
LAST NIGHT, TWO elderly women who were being held as hostages by Hamas militants in Gaza were handed over to the Red Cross.
Israeli citizens Yocheved Lifshitz (85) and Nurit Cooper (79) were released, but their husbands, aged 83 and 84, remain captive with more than 200 other civilians.
The release of the two women took the total number of people freed to four, with an American woman and her teenage daughter having been released three days earlier.
Here is what we know about the hostage situation so far.
More than 220 Israelis, dual nationals and foreigners were kidnapped by Hamas militants during their shock attack on southern Israel on 7 October, which killed more than 1,400 people, according to Israeli officials.
Speaking today on a visit to Israel, France’s President Emmanuel Macron said that releasing hostages held by Hamas must be the “first objective” of the war in Gaza.
“The first objective we should have today is the release of all hostages, without any distinction, because this is an awful crime to play with the lives of children, adults, old people, civilians and soldiers,” Macron said after meeting Israel’s President Isaac Herzog.
Hamas said it had released the two women last night for “compelling humanitarian reasons”.
The daughter of freed Yocheved Lifshitz told Times Radio that her mother has complex health needs.

Three days earlier,American mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan were freed, with Hamas militants also citing humanitarian reasons, as well as efforts by Qatar and Egypt.
All four hostages released so far have been taken to Israel via Egypt.
After the release of the two Americans on Friday, Hamas said it was “working with all mediators to implement the movement’s decision to close the civilian (hostage) file if appropriate security conditions allow.”
While Egypt has traditionally in recent years served as the main mediator between Israel and Palestinian groups, the focus is mainly on Qatar helping to return the hostages safely.
Qatar is a major donor of aid to Gaza and two Hamas leaders are based in the Gulf state.
It has also hosted Hamas’s political office for more than 10 years
A Qatari foreign ministry spokesman said on Friday that the country had mediated between Hamas and the United States and that the release followed “many days of continuous communication between all the parties involved”.
“We will continue our dialogue with both the Israelis and Hamas, and we hope these efforts will lead to the release of all civilian hostages from every nationality, with the ultimate aim of de-escalating the current crisis and restoring peace,” said the spokesman, Majid al-Ansari.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken paid a visit to Qatar on a trip to the region last week and French President Macron has said that Qatar played a “decisive role” in securing the release of the two American hostages.

“The most accommodating mediator is Qatar,” said Hasni Abidi, director of the Geneva-based Center for Studies and Research on the Arab and Mediterranean World (CERMAM).
“It knows Hamas well and is its loyal financial backer,” he said, in referring to Doha’s financing of the salaries of civil servants in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.
Qatar is also respected by the United States, Israel’s chief ally, and is home to the largest US military base in the region.
The International Committee of the Red Cross also contributed to these efforts.
The organisation said in a statement: “The ICRC continues to call for the immediate release of all hostages. We are ready to visit the remaining hostages and to facilitate any future release following an agreement reached by the parties.
“While held in captivity, hostages must be allowed to receive humanitarian assistance and medical care.”

In addition to mediation efforts, the Israeli army inundated the Gaza Strip with leaflets today urging residents to provide information about the hostages held by Hamas in return for financial rewards.
The messages were dropped by Israeli aircraft amid the waves of air strikes targeting Gaza, that Hamas health officials said have killed more than 5,000 people.

“If you want a better future for yourself and your children, do the right thing and send us safe and useful information about kidnapped people in your area,” said the Arabic message on leaflets.
“The Israeli army promises to do everything to preserve your security and that of your homes, as well as a financial reward,” the leaflet added. “We guarantee you total discretion.”
The document provided a telephone number along with details regarding Telegram, Whatsapp and Signal messaging services, where information could be sent about the hostages.
The Israeli army has confirmed the launch of the effort.
“As part of the extensive efforts to free the Israeli and foreign national hostages held by the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza, the (army) today used multiple channels to communicate with the residents of Gaza and ask for information about the hostages,” the army said in a statement.
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned of a looming ground invasion of Gaza, raising the spectre of heavy urban combat and heightening the risk for the hostages.
On Sunday, Israel announced that it will intensify its bombardment of Gaza in order to minimise the risks to its troops when they begin a ground invasion.
However, the timing of the full-scale ground invasion remains unclear.
“Gaza is densely populated, the enemy is preparing a lot of things there – but we are also preparing for them,” Israel’s chief of staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi told one infantry brigade over the weekend.

A ground invasion poses many challenges for Israeli troops, who are likely to face Hamas booby traps and tunnels, and must also weigh the safety of the over 200 hostages being held by the militants.
The Israeli government has come under criticism for its response to the hostage situation.
Since the attack, dozens of Israelis have held sit-ins in front of the defence ministry in Tel Aviv to demand the release of the hostages and the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Shira and Eli Albagh, whose daughter was kidnapped, are among those who have held a pavement vigil. Shiratold the BBC last weekshe holds Israel responsible for failing to keep her daughter safe, but also the rest of the world for not recognising the threat of Hamas.
Eli said: “We want the government to put its attention…to talk with them (Hamas) to release the kidnapped”.
The BBC reported that banners at the vigil urged action from the military leadership, with slogans including “Bring our children home” and “Prisoner exchange”. There was also a sign saying “Bibi must resign” – Netanyahu’s nickname.
Hamas has previously demanded Israel release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages, but more recently ruled out such a move ”until the end of the battle.”
So far, there are also no indications that Israel would be willing to negotiate any such prisoner-swap with Hamas.
Meanwhile, the raging war risks drawing in other countries, notably Lebanon, home to the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group which has engaged in daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces.
At least 41 people have been killed in Lebanon – mostly combatants but also at least four civilians, including a Reuters journalist.
Four people have also been killed in Israel as a result of these exchanges with Lebanon- three soldiers and a civilian.
The US-based Institute for the Study of War has also reported a rise in attacks on Israeli and US targets from Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.
But US President Joe Biden said yesterday that any discussions about a Gaza ceasefire could only take place if Hamas frees all hostages.
“We should have those hostages released and then we can talk,” Biden said at a White House event when asked if he would support a “hostages-for-ceasefire” deal.

Video: Two women held as Hamas hostages are handed over to Red Cross,"LAST UPDATE|24 Oct 2023
VIDEO FOOTAGE HAS been released of the moment two elderly women who had been held as hostages by Hamas militants were handed over to the Red Cross.
85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz was released last night alongside fellow Israeli citizen Nurit Cooper, who is 79-years-old.
However, their husbands, 83 and 84, remain captive with more than 200 other civilians.
Video footage of the moment Lifshitz was handed over to the Red Cross shows her shaking the hand of one of her captors while saying “Shalom”, a Hebrew word meaning “peace” that is also used to express “hello” or “goodbye”.
Her daughter has said that she and her mother are hoping for peace between the two sides.

Yocheved Lifshitz is “very sharp and is very keen” to share information, her daughter has said, as efforts continue to free the other captives and supply aid to Palestinians.
Sharone Lifschitz, who is based in London, said her 85-year-old mother, Yocheved Lifshitz, “seems OK” after being freed from her weeks-long ordeal in Gaza.

Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, has told how she was kept in a “spider web” of tunnels underneath Gaza by Hamas militants during her captivity.
Translating for her mother, Sharone Lifschitz told a press conference in Tel Aviv: “She was taken on the back of a motorbike, with her legs on one side and her head on the other side.
“That she was taken through the ploughed fields with the men in front, on one side, and a man behind her. And while she was being taken she was hit by sticks.
“Until they reached the tunnels. There they walked for a few kilometres on the wet ground.
“There is a huge network of tunnels underneath – it looks like a spider web.”
Britain said six of its nationals are among those still being held hostage since Hamas launched its bloody raids on Israel on 7 October.
Lifschitz, an artist and academic who spells her name differently from her mother, said it was “incredible” to be reunited with her – “to hold her hand and to kiss her cheek”.
“She is very sharp and is very keen to share the information, pass on the information to families of other hostages she was with,” she told the BBC.
She said she will continue to campaign for the release of her father, Oded Lifschitz, and the other captives.

“I hope he is being looked after and has the chance to talk,” Sharone Lifschitz said.
“He speaks good Arabic, so he can communicate very well with the people there.
“He knows many people in Gaza and the West Bank. I want to think that he’s going to be OK.
“My mum said they had been looked after and there was a doctor there, so this gives a lot of comfort to everybody.
“We have so many people that we’ve lost – it is a little ray of light but there is a huge darkness as well.”
Lifschitz said she and her mother still dream of peace with the Palestinians, even as an expected ground invasion of Gaza by Israel threatens sparking a wider war in the region.
“We have to find ways because there is no alternative. If anything, it makes me even more resolved,” she said.

“The way has got longer – we are dealing with grief and loss on a level we can never get over, but as nations we will have to find a way forward.”
The release of the two women took the total number of people freed to four, with an American woman and her teenage daughter having been released three days earlier.
The UK’s Foreign Office welcomed the release of the hostages.
“Our thoughts remain with the families of loved ones still being held captive, as they endure unimaginable anguish and worry at this time,” a spokeswoman said.
“We will continue to work tirelessly with Qatar, Israel and others to ensure all hostages come home safely.”
Doha is a key mediator in the Middle East conflict, with a number of figures in Hamas’s political wing said to live in Qatar.
Lifshitz and Cooper were handed over to the Red Cross at the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt.
Hamas said it had released the two women for humanitarian reasons.
Along with their husbands, they were snatched from their homes in the kibbutz of Nir Oz near the Gaza border during Hamas’s rampage into southern Israeli communities.
More than 1,400 people in Israel, mostly civilians, were killed during the initial Hamas attack.

Hamas says at least 140 killed in overnight strikes as French President Macron arrives in Israel,"LAST UPDATE|24 Oct 2023

FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL Macron has arrived in Tel Aviv to express his country’s “full solidarity” with Israel after the deadly 7 October attacks by Palestinian militant group Hamas.
His visit comes more than two weeks after Hamas militants stormed into Israel from the Gaza Strip and killed at least 1,400 people.
Mostly civilians who were shot, mutilated or burned to death on the first day of the raid, according to Israeli officials.
Among them were 30 French citizens.
Macron is due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express France’s “full solidarity” with Israel after that attack, the French presidency said.
He is also expected to call for the “preservation of the civilian population” in Gaza, amid Israel’s relentless bombardment, and as it prepares for a ground invasion of the overcrowded Palestinian enclave.
More than 5,000 people, most of them women and children, have died during Israel’s attacks, according to numbers given by the Hamas-run health ministry.
The Hamas government today said that Israeli air strikes on the besieged territory overnight killed at least 140 people.
A statement from the government’s media office said “more than 140 people were martyred and hundreds wounded in massacres committed by the occupation (Israel) raids”.
Meanwhile, six workers with the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency were killed in just 24 hours in Gaza, the United Nations said today, bringing to 35 the total of its staff killed since 7 October.

Humanitarian and aid workers have not been spared in more than two weeks of relentless Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip after Hamas gunmen carried out the worst attack in Israel’s 75-year history.
“Since the start of hostilities, at least 16 health workers have been killed while on duty, along with 35 UNRWA staff,” the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA said in an update sent today on the situation up to Monday evening.
Macron will in particular call for a “humanitarian truce” to allow desperately needed aid into Gaza, whose 2.4 million people have been largely deprived of water, food, electricity and other basic supplies after an Israeli blockade, the Elysee Palace said.
Macron and Netanyahu are due to hold a joint press conference at 1:00pm (11:00 Irish time).

The French head of state is also due to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog, as well as opposition leaders Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid in Jerusalem.
And in Tel Aviv, he is due to meet the families of French and French-Israeli nationals killed in the Hamas attack or being held hostage in Gaza.
Seven French citizens are still missing: one of them, a French woman, has been confirmed as among the more than 200 people Israel says were taken hostage by Hamas.
Macron has said the others are also thought to be hostages, but there has not yet been confirmation.
Yesterday, Hamas released two further hostages, three days after an American woman and her teenage daughter were let go.
Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and their octogenarian husbands were among the hostages seized on 7 October.
Sharone Lifschitz, the daugther of Yocheved Lifshitz, said last night in a statement: “I can confirm that my mother Yochi Lifshitz was one of two hostages released to the Red Cross this evening.
“While I cannot put into words the relief that she is now safe, I will remain focused on securing the release of my father and all those, some 200 innocent people, who remain hostages in Gaza.”
Speaking to the BBC, Sharon said her mother “seems okay”.
“She is very sharp and is very keen to share the information, pass on the information to families of other hostages she was with.”
Hamas released both women yesterday citing “compelling humanitarian” reasons, after mediation by Qatar and Egypt.
Qatar is seen as a key mediator in the Middle East conflict, with Doha using its ties to Hamas – a number of figures from the Gaza-ruling group’s political wing are said to live in the country – to negotiate for the release of about 220 hostages taken during the deadly assault on Israel more than two weeks ago.
The French president also aims to continue efforts “to avoid a dangerous escalation in the region”, the Elysee said, amid growing alarm over swelling cross-border exchanges between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Macron will propose relaunching a “true peace process”, with the aim of creating a viable Palestinian state in exchange for guarantees from regional powers towards “Israel’s security”.
There will also probably be exchanges with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, King Abdullah II of Jordan, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and leaders of Gulf nations, the Elysee said.
US President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have already visited Israel.

There was no immediate confirmation by Israeli authorities but Israeli media reported that the women had been taken to the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt.

Some 1,400 people were killed in the worst attack ever to hit Israel, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel launched an immediate war on Hamas and more than 5,000 people have since been killed in its air attacks on Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry.
Hamas accused Israel of having initially refused to accept the two latest hostages to be released.

"Israel ups hostage estimate to 222, while Hamas puts Gaza death toll at over 5,000","LAST UPDATE|23 Oct 2023

GAZA’S HAMAS-RUN health has said that more than 5,000 people have been killed in the besieged Palestinian enclave since Israel launched its withering bombing campaign more than two weeks ago.
On a day when Israel’s army reported more than 300 new strikes within 24 hours, Gaza’s health ministry said the death toll had surged above 5,000, more than 2,000 of them children, though the figures could not be independently verified.
Israeli forces are massed near the Gaza border, and smaller units have already carried out limited incursions, targeting Hamas and hoping to rescue hostages, whose number Israel now puts at 222.
About a dozen trucks carrying desperately needed aid — the third convoy in three days — arrived inside Gaza from Egypt today through Rafah, Gaza’s only crossing not controlled by Israel.
The United States, which brokered the entry of the aid convoys, has vowed a continued flow of aid to the Gaza Strip.
With the first convoys of humanitarian assistance now inside Gaza, the White House said Israel had agreed “there will now be continued flow of this critical assistance”.
The United Nations estimates Gaza needs about 100 trucks a day to meet the needs of its 2.4 million residents, almost half of whom are believed to have been displaced by Israel’s bombing campaign.
UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said the latest delivery of food, water and medical supplies was “another small glimmer of hope for the millions of people in dire need of humanitarian aid. But they need more, much more.”
The much-delayed aid began arriving Saturday under a deal brokered by US President Joe Biden with Egyptian and Israeli leaders.
On the ground, the death toll has continued to mount.
Hamas-controlled authorities in Gaza said at least 80 people had been killed and 30 homes destroyed in renewed Israeli strikes on the besieged Palestinian enclave.
An AFP journalist saw the bodies of many children on the bloodied floor of a Gaza hospital morgue.
Distraught families wept as they came to identify the dead and embrace their loved ones for the last time.
“He was a man with no record, nothing to do with the resistance,” said Wael Wafi, gazing at the body of his cousin.
Hamas militants stormed into Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October and killed at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians who were shot, mutilated or burnt to death on the first day of the raid, according to Israeli officials.
Israel says around 1,500 Hamas fighters were killed in clashes before its army regained control of the area under attack.
They also seized more than 200 hostages in the worst-ever attack in Israel’s history.
More than 4,651 Palestinians, mainly civilians, have been killed across the Gaza Strip in relentless Israeli bombardments in retaliation for the attacks by the Palestinian Islamist militant group, according to the latest toll from the Hamas health ministry in Gaza.
Israel’s leaders have promised a full-scale ground invasion to dismantle Hamas.

Tens of thousands of Israeli forces are gathered at the border and already there appears to be a limited number of Israeli boots on the ground.
In one of the first indications of Israeli troops entering Gaza since October 7, the Israel Defense Forces on Sunday said that one soldier was killed and three others wounded during a tank operation inside the territory.
“This activity was part of the effort to dismantle terror infrastructure, clear the area of terrorists, weapons, and locate missing persons, and bodies,” a military spokesperson said.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned the war with Hamas could take months.
“It will take one month, two months, three months, and at the end there will be no more Hamas,” Gallant said.
Around the world, Israel’s friends and foes alike warned against the war in Gaza spilling over into a full-scale regional conflagration.
Several Western leaders including US President Biden issued a joint statement Sunday after frantic diplomatic talks “to prevent the conflict from spreading” and to “preserve stability in the Middle East.”
Yesterday, there seemed little sign that the conflict was being contained as Israel struck targets in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank, while issuing a stark warning to regional foes against intervening in the war against Hamas.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that if Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah were to get more deeply involved, it would be “the mistake of its life”.
“We will strike it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the significance for it and the state of Lebanon will be devastating,” he said.
Israeli strikes were reported against two airports in Syria, a mosque used by “terror operatives” in the West Bank city of Jenin and Hezbollah “military infrastructure” inside Lebanon.
Hamas, Hezbollah and Syria’s government are all backed by Iran, which opposes Israel’s existence and has warned the region could spiral “out of control”.
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh spoke by phone with Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on Sunday, the militant group said on Telegram.
During their call, “they discussed the latest developments” in the war, as well as the “use of all the possible ways to stop” Israel’s campaign, it said.
With fears growing that the conflict could spread, Israel admitted yesterday to accidentally hitting an Egyptian border post, apologising for the incident which Cairo said had left an unspecified number of border guards with “minor injuries”.
But Washington said it wouldn’t hesitate to act in the event of any “escalation”, just hours after the Pentagon moved to step up military readiness in the region.
“If any group or any country is looking to widen this conflict and take advantage of this very unfortunate situation that we see, our advice is: don’t,” US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said on ABC News.
Pope Francis used his weekly Angelus prayer in Rome yesterday to plead for an end to the bloodshed.
“War is always a defeat, it is a destruction of human fraternity. Brothers, stop!” he said.

"Israeli ambassador's comments about President Michael D Higgins 'unhelpful', says Coveney","COMMENTS MADE BY the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland accusing President Michael D Higgins of making “misinformed comments” about Israel are “unhelpful”, according to Enterprise Minister Simon Coveney.
During a visit to Rome last week, President Higgins addressed the conflict between Israel and Hamas stating:
“To announce in advance that you will break international law and to do so on an innocent population, it reduces all the code that was there from second world war on protection of civilians and it reduces it to tatters,” said the president.
In an interview with the Sunday Independent, Israel’s Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich said the president was misinformed in his remarks.

Labour leader Ivana Bacik told RTÉ’s The Week in Politics that the ambassador’s comments are a “serious matter”, stating that Erlich’s position here in Ireland is “under question.”
Asked for his reaction on the ambassador’ comment, Coveney told RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Programme today:
“I don’t think that’s helpful. You know, President Michael D Higgins is somebody who for many years has taken an interest in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And he, like many others in Ireland, are deeply concerned about what is currently unfolding in Gaza.
“I’ve been to Gaza on numerous occasions as a foreign minister. I was one of the most vocal foreign ministers in the European Union on the Palestinian issue for many years. I also have a good relationship I hope with Israel. But, you know, I don’t think it’s helpful when an ambassador starts to make pointed comments in relation to our president,” he said.
Coveney said the president is reflecting the view of many in Ireland, adding that it is the Irish government’s position that it “unreservedly condemns the atrocity that Hamas is responsible for in terms of the killing of 1400 innocent Israelis”.
“But we are also deeply concerned about what continues to unfold in terms of human suffering in Gaza. We want a ceasefire and we want humanitarian aid corridors open. Ireland will continue to advocate for that at the European level and at the UN level,” said the minister.

The minister said he didn’t agree with any suggestion that the Israeli ambassador should be expelled.
“I think we need to open lines of communication with the Israeli government through their ambassador here. That’s how diplomacy works. And we need to continue to talk to the Israeli Government, even if we disagree with them at times, just like we need to continue to speak to the Palestinian ambassador in Dublin.
“So I don’t believe that when you disagree with a country that you are quick to call for the expulsion of ambassadors. I just don’t think that’s how international diplomacy should work,” he concluded.

New aid convoy enters Gaza amid concerns region could spiral 'out of control',"LAST UPDATE|22 Oct 2023

A NEW CONVOY of 17 aid trucks entered war-torn Gaza today as Israel stepped up strikes on the Palestinian enclave which is suffering a “catastrophic” humanitarian situation in the war sparked by Hamas’s bloody attack.
With fears of a wider conflagration mounting, Iran said the region could spiral “out of control” and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanon’s Hezbollah that if it got involved, it would be “the mistake of its life”.
Hamas militants stormed into Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October and killed at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians who were shot, mutilated or burnt to death on the first day of the raid, according to Israeli officials.
It was the worst attack on civilians in Israel’s history and coincided with the end of the religious holiday of Sukkot.
Israel’s retaliatory bombing campaign has killed more than 4,600 Palestinians, mainly civilians, according to the health ministry in Gaza.
More than 40% of Gaza’s housing has been damaged or destroyed, according to the UN citing local authorities, and Israel has halted food, water, fuel and electricity supplies.
Sunday’s delivery of 17 trucks of aid through Gaza’s Rafah crossing with Egypt was the second such operation in two days, with 20 lorries having arrived on Saturday following negotiations and US pressure.
Separately, an AFP journalist in Gaza saw six trucks leaving the Rafah terminal after filling up from dwindling fuel stocks held at the crossing.
The United Nations estimates that about 100 trucks per day are required to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.4 million residents given the “catastrophic” humanitarian situation.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned fuel supplies would run out in three days.
“Without fuel, there will be no humanitarian assistance,” Philippe Lazzarini said.
Israeli attacks intensify
Israel has massed tens of thousands of troops around the enclave for an anticipated ground invasion.

Israel increased its attacks overnight and killed “dozens of terrorists” in and around Gaza City, including the deputy commander of the Hamas rocket network, military spokesman Daniel Hagari said today.
Hamas said overnight raids on the Gaza Strip killed at least 80 people and destroyed more than 30 homes.
In central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah, an AFP journalist saw the bodies of children on the bloodied floor of a morgue. A man clutched his dead toddler and people wept as they identified the bodies of relatives.
Om Ahmad Abu Sanjar was sleeping in her Rafah home when she “woke up to the glass shattering on us and bricks falling”. “We got out miraculously,” she told AFP.
The scale of the bombing has left basic systems unable to function, with the UN saying dozens of unidentified bodies were buried in a mass grave in Gaza City because cold storage had run out.
The Israeli Defence Forces this evening confirmed that one of its tanks “accidentally fired and hit an Egyptian post adjacent to the border in the area of Kerem Shalom”.

A short while ago, an IDF tank accidentally fired and hit an Egyptian post adjacent to the border in the area of Kerem Shalom. The incident is being investigated and the details are under review.The IDF expresses sorrow regarding the incident.
“The incident is being investigated and the details are under review. The IDF expresses sorrow regarding the incident,” a post on X, formerly Twitter, noted.
Egypt’s military spokesman said an unspecified number of border guards sustained “minor injuries” from “fragments of a shell accidentally fired from an Israeli tank”.
The Egyptian army said Israel had “immediately expressed its regret over the unintentional incident and an investigation is underway”.
Regional tensions rise
Israel has warned more than one million residents in northern Gaza to move south for their safety, and the UN says more than half of the territory’s population is now internally displaced.
Hundreds of thousands of civilians are believed to remain in and around Gaza City in the north, unwilling or unable to leave.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian today said that if Washington and Israel “do not immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza, anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control”.

Fresh fire was also exchanged across Israel’s border with Lebanon, which the Israeli military warned could be dragged into the war by Hamas ally Hezbollah.
On a visit to troops near the border, Netanyahu said Hezbollah would make “the mistake of its life” if it started a war with Israel.
“We will strike it with a force it cannot even imagine, and the significance for it and the state of Lebanon will be devastating,” Netanyahu added.
Western leaders have warned Hezbollah against intervening but the group’s number two has said it is ready to step up involvement.
Israel has evacuated dozens of northern communities, and nearly 4,000 people in Lebanon have fled border areas for the southern city of Tyre.
‘Brothers, stop!’
Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday said he had increased US military readiness in the Middle East.
The Pentagon said the move aimed to defend Israel amid what it called “escalations by Iran” and its proxies across the region.
It also said it was notifying additional troops to “prepare to deploy orders” without specifying how many or when they could be dispatched.
A ground invasion poses myriad challenges for Israeli troops, who are likely to face Hamas booby traps and tunnels.
Israel must also weigh the safety of the 212 hostages it says were abducted by the militants.
After a Cairo peace summit of regional and Western leaders finished without a joint statement, Pope Francis pleaded for an end to the bloodshed during his weekly Angelus prayer in Rome today.
He said: “War is always a defeat, it is a destruction of human fraternity. Brothers, stop!”

First humanitarian aid rolls into Gaza as Israel vows to increase air strikes,"LAST UPDATE|21 Oct 2023

THE FIRST AID trucks arrived in the war-torn Gaza Strip from Egypt today, bringing humanitarian relief to the Hamas-controlled Palestinian enclave suffering what the UN chief labelled a “god awful nightmare”.
Israel has vowed to step up its punishing strikes in Gaza to increase pressure on Hamas, a military spokesman told a press conference this evening.
Since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, which left 1,400 dead, Israel has launched devastating air and ground bombardments of Gaza. The Hamas authorities say 4,385 people have died.
Israel has also massed tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks along the Gaza border for a widely anticipated ground invasion.
“We have to enter the next phase of the war in the best conditions, not according to what anyone tells us. From today, we are increasing the strikes and minimising the danger,” military spokesman Admiral Daniel Hagari told a press conference today.
Twenty trucks from the Egyptian Red Crescent, which is responsible for delivering aid from various UN agencies, passed through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt into Gaza today.
The crossing — the only one into Gaza not controlled by Israel — closed again after the trucks passed.
The lorries had been waiting for days on the Egyptian side after Israel agreed to allow aid to enter following a request from its top ally the United States.
UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said the convoy “must not be the last” and that the delivery would start “a sustainable effort to provide essential supplies” to Gaza.
UN chief Antonio Guterres warned on Friday that the aid was “the difference between life and death” for many Gazans, more than one million of whom have been displaced.
“Much more” aid needs to be sent, he told a peace summit in Egypt today.
A joint statement issued by the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, the UNDP, UNFPA and Unicef this evening called for “a humanitarian ceasefire, along with immediate, unrestricted humanitarian access throughout Gaza to allow humanitarian actors to reach civilians in need, save lives and prevent further human suffering”.
The statement said the aid carried in the 20 trucks allowed to enter today “is only a small beginning and far from enough”.
“More than 1.6 million people in Gaza are in critical need of humanitarian aid. Children, pregnant women and the elderly remain the most vulnerable. Nearly half of Gaza’s population are children…
“Gaza was a desperate humanitarian situation before the most recent hostilities. It is now catastrophic. The world must do more.”

‘Reeling in pain’
As international tensions soar, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi hosted a peace summit in Cairo today attended by regional and some Western leaders.
“The time has come for action to end this god awful nightmare,” Guterres told the summit, calling for a “humanitarian ceasefire”.
The region “is reeling in pain and one step from the precipice”, he added.
Egypt, historically a key mediator between Hamas and Israel, has urged “restraint” and called to restart long-frozen peace talks.
But diplomatic efforts to end the violence have made little headway, with Israel and its enemy Iran, a supporter of Hamas and other armed groups, among those absent from the Cairo talks.
‘Sliver of hope’
A full-blown Israeli land offensive carries many risks, including to the more than 200 hostages Hamas took during their raid and whose fate is shrouded in uncertainty.
So the release of the first two hostages — US mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan — offered a rare “sliver of hope”, Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said.
US President Joe Biden said he was “overjoyed” and thanked Qatar, which hosts Hamas’ political bureau, for its mediation in securing the release.
He said he was working “around the clock” to win the return of other Americans being held.
Natalie Raanan’s half-brother Ben told BBC News he felt an “overwhelming sense of joy” at the release after “the most horrible of ordeals”.
Hamas said Egypt and Qatar had negotiated the release and it was “working with all mediators to implement the movement’s decision to close the civilian (hostage) file if appropriate security conditions allow”.
Traumatised families with loved ones missing in Gaza demanded more action.
“Absolutely nothing has been done,” Assaf Shem Tov, whose nephew was abducted from a music festival where hundreds were killed by Hamas, said Friday.
“We ask humanity to interfere and bring back all those young boys, young girls, mothers, babies.”
Crucial aid
In Gaza, Israeli jets continued the relentless bombing campaign, with the military saying it hit more than 100 Hamas targets overnight.
Almost half of Gaza’s residents have been displaced, according to the United Nations.

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said today that 17 staff have been confirmed killed in the war, warning the actual numbers “are likely to be higher”.
At least 30% of all housing in Gaza has been destroyed or damaged, the UN says, citing local authorities, and thousands have taken refuge in a tent city set up in southern Gaza’s Khan Yunis.
Fadwa al-Najjar said she and her seven children walked for 10 hours to reach the camp, at some points breaking into a run as air strikes descended around them.
“We saw bodies and limbs torn off and we just started praying, thinking we were going to die,” she told AFP.
“I would have preferred not to leave, to have stayed at home and died there,” her daughter Malak added.
Israel’s operation will take not “a day, nor a week, nor a month,” the country’s defence minister Yoav Gallant warned Friday, and will result in “the end of Israel’s responsibilities in the Gaza Strip”.
An Israeli foreign ministry source, speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, said Israel envisaged “handing over the keys” to neighbouring Egypt, which has strongly rejected attempts to place Gaza’s residents under its responsibility.
Regional tensions flare
“I’m afraid that the current destruction is part of a clear plan for people to have no place left to live,” Omar Ashour, a retired general in Gaza, said.
“This will cause a second Nakba,” he added, referring to the 760,000 Palestinians who were expelled from or fled their homes when Israel was created in 1948.
The United States has moved two aircraft carriers into the eastern Mediterranean to deter Iran or Lebanon’s Hezbollah, both Hamas allies, amid fears of a wider conflagration.
Fire across Israel’s border with Lebanon continued overnight though, with one Israeli soldier killed, Israeli radio said, and the military announced it hit Hezbollah targets after rocket and anti-tank missile fire.
Israel yesterday ordered the 25,000 residents of the northern town of Kiryat Shmona to evacuate.
Violence has also flared in the West Bank, where 84 Palestinians have been killed since 7 October, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Protests have erupted over the conflict across the region, and Israel on Saturday urged its citizens to immediately leave Egypt and Jordan.

Paddy Cosgrave resigns as Web Summit CEO amid controversy over Israel comments,"LAST UPDATE|21 Oct 2023
PADDY COSGRAVE HAS resigned as chief executive officer of the Web Summit amid ongoing controversy over comments he made about the Israel-Hamas war.
Earlier, Amazon became the latest large multinational corporation to pull out of the conference.
In a statement released today, Cosgrave said: “I am resigning as CEO of Web Summit with immediate effect.
“Unfortunately my personal comments have become a distraction from the event, and our team, our sponsors, our startups and the people who attend.
“I sincerely apologise again for any hurt I have caused.”
A spokesperson for Web Summit confirmed that the conference will still take place in Lisbon as planned from 13 to 16 November.

Earlier today a spokesperson for Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing wing, said it would not attend the conference.
This follows similar statements from Meta, Google, Siemens, Intel and others. A host of other companies and speakers have also withdrawn from the event.
The slew of withdrawals come after Cosgrave made comments about the war between Israel and Hamas, which he subsequently apologised for after some international tech backers pulled out of this year’s conference.
Cosgrave earlier this month said on X, formerly Twitter, he was “shocked at the rhetoric and actions of so many Western leaders & governments”, who have supported Israel. “War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies.”
He later condemned the attacks by Hamas and expressed his “hope for peaceful reconciliation”.
However, the Israeli ambassador to Portugal, Dor Shapira, described the statement as “outrageous”, and said he had written to the Mayor of Lisbon informing him that Israeli companies will not be attending this year’s Web Summit.
Apology
Cosgrave initially defended his comments, saying he “is not going to relent”.

However, on Tuesday he issued anapologyfor the “timing” of his opinion and “the way it has been presented”.
“I unreservedly condemn Hamas’ evil, disgusting and monstrous October 7 attack. I also call for the unconditional release of all hostages,” he said in a statement published on the Web Summit site.
“I unequivocally support Israel’s right to exist and to defend itself. I unequivocally support a two-state solution.
“Like so many figures globally, I also believe that, in defending itself, Israel should adhere to international law and the Geneva Conventions – ie, not commit war crimes… No country should breach these laws, even if atrocities were committed against it.”
Cosgrave said he had tried to echo the sentiments of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who urged Israel to avoid harming civilians.

"All Irish citizens in Gaza accounted for, as efforts continue to get them out, minister says","ALL IRISH CITIZENS and people with dual Irish-Palestinian citizenship have been accounted for in Gaza, Minister Catherine Martin has said.
There are around 35 to 40 people with Irish citizenship or dual citizenship in Gaza, as well as their dependents.
Speaking onRTÉ Radio 1′s This Week programmetoday, Martin said it is her understanding that Irish embassies in the region have made contact with these people and accounted for their whereabouts, and that efforts are being made to get them out of Gaza where possible.
Martin’s comments come as20 trucks carrying humanitarian aidwere today finally allowed to enter Gaza via the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.

“The key there in terms of Irish citizens coming out of Gaza was firstly that opening of the Rafah crossing, and that’s why we were pushing for the acceleration of that. So it’s a first step that those trucks have gotten through,” Martin stated.
She said Irish embassies remain in contact with all Irish citizens, and people with dual citizenship, in the Gaza Strip.
“I have been informed that our embassies have accounted for those with citizenship or co-citizenship, both registering with them and maintaining contact with them and being a liaison with the authorities in respect of endeavouring to get them out,” Martin said.
War crimes
The minister added that while Israel has “a right under international law to defend itself”, cutting off food and water to civilians in Gaza cannot be labelled as self-defence.
“[It] cannot be called self-defence to cut off water and electricity to the whole civilian population. That is collective punishment”, Martin said, adding that “collective punishment is a flagrant breach of international law”.

“There are rules of war and I believe that they are not being adhered to at the moment,” the minister stated.
She called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, as well as saying Hamas must release all its hostages.
Speaking on the same programme, People Before Profit–Solidarity TD Paul Murphy said the Israeli ambassador should be expelled from Ireland.
“I think Ireland needs to explicitly say that what is happening in terms of Israel, indeed, are war crimes. But also we should be expelling the Israeli ambassador and sending a signal that certainly we do not go along with this,” Murphy said.

'Will of the people': Higgins says neither Taoiseach or Tánaiste want a 'silent president',"PRESIDENT MICHEAL D Higgins has said neither the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste want a “silent president” and added that he is “reflecting the will of the people” who voted for him.
During a five-day visit to Rome, President Higgins criticised Israel on several occasions,  stating that it riskedreducing the Geneva Convention to “tatters”and falling into thesame “category” as Hamaswith its actions in the besieged Gaza Strip.
He added that theblocking of essential aid into Gaza was “criminal”.
President Higgins also said that Ursula von der Leyen “wasn’t speaking for Ireland” during her recent visit to Israel.
During her visit, von der Leyen stated: “I know that how Israel responds will show that it is a democracy.”
President Higgins said these were a “thoughtless and even reckless set of actions” and other Irish politicians have also criticised her interventions, includingTaoiseach Leo Varadkar who said her comments “lacked balance”.
Speaking to reporters yesterday on the sidelines of the World Food Forum in Rome, President Higgins said “foreign policy belongs to us all”.
He also said that the view that he should remain silent on these issues is an “extreme” one and added: “It is not the view I believe or either the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach that what you need is a silent president or a president that simply takes pieces of paper in front of him or her and signs them at the behest of somebody who is part of a department.”
President Higgins also told reporters: “I’ve been elected as President of Ireland twice, it’s a deep honour and a deep privilege and a great responsibility and I feel I have a responsibility and I think I am reflecting the will of the people who put me in Áras an Uachtaráin.”
Referencing the end of his term in 2025, President Higgins stated: “In a couple of years’ time people will be able to resolve this issue themselves in relation to whether they want a silent person, a puppet, or whether they want a president.”

The president added that he has campaigned on the issues he is speaking out about over the course of 50 years as a politician, political scientist and as a sociologist.
“I’m 82 and from about the age of 30, I’ve been an activist on all of the issues that we’ve been speaking about today,” said President Higgins.
“I think people are entitled to their opinion that they would like somebody who (would keep silent) but I think they are very few.
“They’re entitled to it but we are living where we are.”
Meanwhile, President Higgins welcomed additional aid funding for Gaza from Ireland.
This week, Tánaiste Micheál Martin announced an “immediate” €13 million humanitarian aid package to help those inside the Gaza Strip.
“I saw the new figures and I very much commend them on giving the additional funding that is necessary,” said President Higgins yesterday.
He added that this additional funding “is now a matter of emergency”.
“The people who are in south Gaza were already under the deepest stress and their numbers have been increased by those who have gone south, more accurately would have been forced south,” said President Higgins, referencing recent Israeli orders for citizens in north Gaza to evacuate to the south.
“On the times I visited Gaza, it was to see how infrastructure would be built – schools, hospitals, and so forth – only to be, as part of the conflict, bombed and then replaced again,” said President Higgins.
“What is needed now is something much more than a pledge of money for reconstruction because that has happened in the past but the conflict was left in place.
“I believe myself that the best intervention is one that will address the issue consistently and in an informed way.”

"Bobby McDonagh 
 In seeking full truth, we must avoid picking sides between the two narratives","LAST UPDATE|20 Oct 2023
IN IRELAND, AS elsewhere, witnesses swear an oath in court to tell “the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth”.
The ferociously competing narratives about the ongoing tragic conflict in Israel and Gaza are a reminder that understanding the “whole truth” is of fundamental importance. In politics, as in the courts, the “truth” and, even, “nothing but the truth” can be rendered dangerously meaningless if the “whole truth” is disregarded.
Partial views of the past and present are a large part of the Middle East problem. When those who speak on behalf of Israel or the Palestinians make their respective cases, often persuasively, much of what they say is, taken at face value, true. However, more often than not, the alternative narratives fail to acknowledge, or even to understand, that the “whole truth” necessarily involves, for each side, uncomfortable realities that they either cannot see or choose to ignore. It is not just truth, in its full sense, that is lost in the context of such myopia. It can also be balance, mutual respect, the prospects for longer-term peace, and even sometimes an appreciation of each other’s humanity.
The Israeli truths include their legitimate pride in the democratic state they have created, their very real need for security in a threatening environment, their long experience of terrorism, the dark spectre of antisemitism and, above all perhaps, their responsibility to the memory of the holocaust out of which the Israeli state was born. Most recently, the event that is naturally at the forefront of righteous anger in Israel has been the grotesque Hamas invasion of Israel, involving the wicked murder, maiming and kidnapping of innocent civilians, men women and children. When I say these are Israeli truths, they should, of course, also be our own truths and those of all decent people around the world.
Advertisement
The Palestinian truths, which also should be our own truths, are quite different. They include the fact that, as a people, they have, over many decades, been dispossessed, humiliated, and mistreated, often subject to violence or imprisonment. The world, including many Arab regimes, has largely disregarded them.
They are often treated as second-class human beings. In more recent days, the lived reality of innocent Palestinian civilians – again men, women and children – has been widespread bombing, death, destruction and gross deprivation. At the heart of the righteous anger of Palestinians are the huge, entirely illegal, settlements on their own land, the Occupied Territories.Sioux Chief Red Cloud’s words would no doubt resonate with Palestinians, in relation not just to Israeli policy but to the apathy of the international community: “they made us many promises, more than I can remember, but they never kept but one; they promised to take our land and they took it.”
The profound and extraordinarily difficult challenge for Ireland, as for others around the world, is to try to understand and empathise with both of the conflicting truths in all their complexity. If we seek the full truth, we must avoid picking sides between the two narratives. Each version of reality can be said, from its particular perspective, to be “true”. The “whole truth”, however, is a different story.
The Irish Government comes under strong pressure from the proponents of both versions of the truth who, from their different perspectives, see the conflict as the “good guys” against the “bad guys”. They want us to nail our colours to their particular mast.
In fact, what our Government is trying to do is to grapple with the full, complex and sometimes contradictory truth. In his speech to the Dáil on Wednesday, Micheál Martin set out clearly the Government’s approach. He unequivocally and strongly condemned the Hamas attack. He underlined Israel’s right to defend itself within the parameters of international humanitarian law, which applies in all conflicts and in all circumstances.
He called for an immediate humanitarian pause or ceasefire. He promised significant further Irish funding for humanitarian relief in Gaza. He placed particular emphasis on support for a two-state solution, which remains the only conceivable solution. Importantly, he stressed that, if ever there was a time to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process, it is now. While this balanced approach is inevitably criticised by both sides, it is a sensible and moral contribution to the international debate, including within the European Union.

The overall EU response to the recent events was initially shaky. A maverick European Commissioner, Oliver Varhelyi, without either authority or moral compass, announced that all humanitarian aid to Palestinians would be cut off. He was immediately put back in his box by the EU’s decision to triple its aid to Gaza. It will remain the largest donor.
Also, the initial messaging of the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who has generally been an impressive President, including in providing leadership on Europe’s response to Putin’s brutal assault on Ukraine, was ill-judged.
In his Dáil speech, Micheál Martin also spoke of some of the remarkable people, Israeli and Palestinian, whom he had met during his recent visit to the region. One group he met was theParents Circle, a group which brings together Israeli and Palestinian families who have suffered bereavements due to the conflict. He sat over a meal with the parents of a thirteen-year-old Israeli girl killed in a Palestinian suicide bombing and a ten-year-old Palestinian girl killed by an Israeli sniper. The two fathers are central toColum McCann’s novel Apeirogon. The courage of such parents, who dare to recognise the whole truth, offers some hope in these dark times.

FactFind: What exactly do we know - and not know - about the Gaza hospital explosion,"ACCUSATIONS OF WAR crimes have been levelled against both Hamas and Israel following an explosion at al-Ahli hospital in Gazaon Tuesday, reportedly killing hundreds.
However, who is responsible remains unproven, as does the death toll, the weapon used, and even – for a time – the exact location of the blast. Governments, media organisations and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigators have poured over evidence in a bid to uncover the truth of what happened.
While much remains unknown, some new information has come to light over the past few days, with an Al Jazeera video clip and a small crater at the forefront of debates over who and what caused the explosion.
Here’s what we know.
The explosion at the hospital happened just before 7pm (5pm Irish-time) on Tuesday, and it was caught on camera by Al Jazeera live footage.
The video, which has been shared online, shows a bright light in the sky above Gaza which flashes twice before exploding. A much larger explosion happens moments later.
While initial reports suggested that the al-Ahli hospital building in Gaza had been hit with a missile and possibly even destroyed, more reliable reports and footage that emerged soon afterwards show thatit was a car park in the hospital complex that was hit.

The Anglican-run al-Ahli Hospital is located in Gaza City, an area that the IDF had been encouraging civilians to evacuate “for their own safety and protection” – a move that was criticised by aid organisations.
“The order for evacuation has been impossible to carry out given the current insecurity, critical condition of many patients, and lack of ambulances, staff, health system bed capacity, and alternative shelter for those displaced,” the World Health Organisationsaid in a statementcondemning the attack.
At the time of the explosion, about 1,000 people were sheltering in the hospital’s courtyard, while another 600 people were inside the hospital building, according to a local Anglican leader whospoke to the BBC.
Shortly after the explosion, the Palestinian Ministry of Health blamed the blast on Israeli bombers and said that500 peoplehad been killed. In the following days this number has been revised down to471 deathsby Gaza’s health ministry.
Israel has described the death tolls given by Palestinian sources as being “inflated” and released infrared aerial footage showing the scene after the blast. “If so many people were killed, then where were the bodies?” aspokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) asked.
Separately, The Palestinian Red Crescent Societyhas describedthe explosion as killing “hundreds of civilians”, while media footage of the aftermath shows that dozens, at the very least, had been hurt in the blast.

US intelligence agenciessaidin an intelligence assessment leaked to the media that 100-300 deaths was the most likely figure for the number of fatalities, though cautioned that this may be revised as more information comes in.
As of today, there is still no independently-verified death toll, butit would appear to be somewhere between 100 and 471, based on the lowest figure from the US intelligence assessment and the highest figure from the Gazan health ministry.
As the US intelligent reports puts it, “This death toll still reflects a staggering loss of life.”
The IDF maintains that a rocket launched over the hospital by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group malfunctioned, dropping to the hospital car park where fuel and munitions ignited.
Palestinian Islamic Jihad is a militant group distinct from Hamas that operates in Gaza and has attacked Israel.
“Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza,” Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
Both Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas have blamed Israel for the bombing of the hospital from the start.
Islamic Jihad has denied the allegations from Israel that it was responsible as “false and baseless”.
Israel has released audio of what it claims are two Hamas operatives speaking to each other about the explosion, with one saying it was caused by a failed Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket. However, there is no proof the audio is authentic — nor would the words of an unnamed militant be conclusive.
Thefootage from an Al Jazeera livestream appears to have captured the moment of the explosionat the al-Ahli hospital – but exactly what it shows is being disputed.
The footage has featured heavily in IDF statements,who claimthat it shows a rocket launched from Gaza failing high in the air, seconds before the blast.
However, the Al Jazeera digital investigations team aligned their video with other footage showing the skies over Gaza taken from other viewpoints at the time when the explosion happened.
While the footage does show rocket launches from Gaza,their analysisconcludes that the rocket that the IDF said had failed was in fact destroyed by Israel’s Iron Dome defence system and could be seen breaking apart in the sky.

Their analysis also claims to identify four Israeli airstrikes in the area before the fatal blast at the hospital.
In other words, the IDF and Al Jazeera are using the same video footage of the incident to claim two opposing things.

Acrater in the hospital car parkhas been seen numerous times in aerial images as well as in footage and photos taken from the aftermath of the explosion.
There appears to be a consensus among open-source intelligence investigators that this is likely theimpact crater.
Analysts who say that Israel was not involved have argued that the size of the crater appears to be smaller than would be expected from typical Israeli munitions.
An analysisby investigative journalism group Bellingcat quoted one military adviser who noted that the impact crater did not appear to be consistent with the 500, 1000 or 2000-pound bombs used by Israel.
The lack of damage to the structure of the hospital, as well as nearby windows that remained intact and the large burn area have been cited to further suggest that whatever caused the blast was unlike typical Israeli airstrikes.
However, there arealternative theorieshave also been put forth, such as thatthe weaponused was a hellfire rocket or an airburst bomb, which explodes before hitting the ground.
Someexpertshave cast doubt on some of these theories too, saying that the pattern of damage doesn’t match.
Much of the analyses of the available information by respected organisations and experts fails to come down on either side.
This is in large part because there is information that is still not available.
US President Joe Biden has backed Israel’s claims, although intelligence sources that have spoken to the media have not said what evidence had brought him to that conclusion. TheNew York Times reportedthat US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, had cited infrared satellite data.
However, America’s intelligence partners have been slow to back up these claims, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeauwho saidthat evidence was still being reviewed.
Palestinian Islamic Jihad also claim to have the remnants of an Israeli missile that hit the hospital grounds,Channel 4 reports, but so far have not released evidence of it.
The missing missile fragments are an important part of the jigsaw. Any wreckage from whatever caused the explosion would help to determine who and where it came from. As of now, however, that has not been made public.

"Two American hostages released by Hamas, Israel and militant group say","LAST UPDATE|20 Oct 2023

ISRAEL HAS CONFIRMED that Hamas had released two Americans among more than 200 hostages abducted earlier this month as it kept up its unrelenting bombing of Gaza in response to the Islamists’ unprecedented attacks across the border.
International Committee of the Red Cross president Mirjana Spoljaric said the Americans’ release, which came after mediation by Qatar and Egypt, provided a “sliver of hope” for the families of other hostages held in Gaza, who include nationals of two dozen countries around the world.
It came as residents of Gaza desperately awaited aid, with US President Joe Biden saying he expected the first trucks to enter Gaza from Egypt in the “next 24 to 48 hours”. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had earlier visited the border to press for the delivery of “life and death” relief to its 2.4 million people.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the Islamist group launched a shock raid from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians shot, mutilated or burned to death, according to Israeli officials.
In response to the Hamas attack, Israeli bombers have levelled entire city blocks in Gaza in preparation for a ground invasion they say is coming soon. The Hamas-run health ministry said 4,137 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in the onslaught.
Israel identified the two Americans freed today as mother and daughter Judith Tai Raanan and Natalie Shoshana Raanan, who were abducted from Nahal Oz kibbutz near the border almost two weeks ago.
Following their release, Biden said they had “endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days, and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family”.
Hamas said it had released the pair “in response to Qatari efforts”. The Gulf state, which hosts Hamas’s political bureau, has been attempting to mediate in the crisis.
Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majid al-Ansari said: “We hope these efforts will lead to the release of all civilian hostages from every nationality.”
Hamas said they were “working with all mediators to implement the movement’s decision to close the civilian (hostage) file if appropriate security conditions allow”.
The Israeli military said earlier today that most of those abducted to Gaza were still alive and more than 20 of them were minors.
Some 175 lorries stuffed with vital medicines, food, and water stretched into the distance at the Rafah crossing with Egypt, which is scrambling to repair the route into besieged Gaza – the only one not controlled by Israel.
Overseeing operations personally, the UN chief told reporters: “These trucks are not just trucks, they are a lifeline, they are the difference between life and death for so many people in Gaza.”
Israeli jets pounded more than 100 Hamas targets in Gaza overnight, the army said, with AFP reporters hearing loud explosions and witnessing plumes of smoke billowing from the northern Gaza Strip.
Embracing front-line soldiers and clad in body armour, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged them to “fight like lions” and “win with full force”.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told some of the tens of thousands of personnel preparing the ground invasion that “the order will come soon”.
Aid agencies in Gaza said they had received warnings from Israel to evacuate a major hospital and five schools ahead of a potential strike.
The Al-Quds Hospital is in northern Gaza, which has borne the brunt of Israeli air raids.

The US president said today he expected the first aid for Gaza to pass through the Rafah crossing from Egypt within the next two days, under a deal he clinched to allow in 20 trucks of supplies for civilians.
But World Health Organization emergencies directorMike Ryan said Biden’s 20-truck dealwas “a drop in the ocean of need” and that 2,000 trucks were required.
The UN says more than one million of Gaza’s 2.4 million people are displaced, with the humanitarian situation “beyond catastrophic” and deteriorating daily.
Refugees from northern Gaza told harrowing tales of bombs, profiteering and extreme temperatures as whole families trekked on foot to flee the violence.
Mother of seven Fadwa Al-Najjar walked for 10 hours with her family from northern Gaza to reach a UN camp in the southern city of Khan Yunis, saying she saw cars hit by a strike just in front of them.
“We saw bodies and limbs torn off and we just started praying, thinking we were going to die,” she said.
On the other side of the conflict, the full horror of what Israel suffered on 7 October and following days was still emerging, as traumatised residents recounted their stories.
Shachar Butler, a security chief at the Nir Oz kibbutz, where Hamas militants killed or kidnapped a quarter of the 400 residents, recalls more than a dozen gunmen spraying bullets indiscriminately and lobbing grenades at homes.
“It’s unimaginable,” the 40-year-old told AFP as part of a trip organised by the Israeli military.
“Anytime someone tried to touch my window, I shot him,” he said. “The people who came out got kidnapped, killed, executed, slaughtered.”
Butler estimated as many as 200 militants attacked the kibbutz, entering from three sides before going house-to-house. Homes there were still charred with burnt personal belongings strewn everywhere.
Israel says around 1,500 Hamas fighters were killed in clashes before its army regained control.
Biden requested a massive $105 billion security package today, including $14 billion for Israel, but paralysis in the still speakerless Congress means it will hit an immediate wall.
Fresh from a whirlwind trip to Israel this week, Biden is hoping to staunch the possibility of a wider Middle East war.
The United States has moved two aircraft carriers into the eastern Mediterranean to deter Iran or Lebanon’s Hezbollah, both Hamas allies, from getting involved.
After days of clashes with Hezbollah fighters along the Lebanese border, Israeli authorities announced the evacuation of Kiryat Shmona, a nearby town which is home to some 25,000 residents, many of whom have already left.
The conflict has inflamed passions across the region, with protests held in several countries.
Thousands flooded into Egypt’s iconic Tahrir Square in support of Gaza, an AFP correspondent said. Protests were also held outside the French and US embassies in Tunis.

"Biden requests over €100 billion for Israel, Ukraine and more after rare Oval Office address","LAST UPDATE|20 Oct 2023

US PRESIDENT JOE Biden has requested a $106 billion (€100.1 billion) national security package, after a rare Oval Office speech to the public last night.
Republican paralysis in Congress means it hit an immediate wall, after Trump-ally Jim Jordanfailed to be named speaker in his third attempt.
Biden last night declared it is “vital for America’s national security” for Israel and Ukraine to succeed in their wars.
In his request today, it pledged $61 billion (€57.6 billion) towards military aid to Ukraine and $14 billion (€13.2 billion) to Israel.
He made the case last night for deepening US involvement in two foreign conflicts as he prepared to ask for billions of dollars in military assistance for both countries.
Biden said “conflict and chaos could spread in other parts of the world” if international aggression is allowed to continue.
He sent a funding request this evening to the tune of $106 billion (€100 billion).
But Biden’s request comes as the US House of Representativesremains in chaos, with Republicans, who hold a narrow majority, in their worst meltdown for decades and unable to elect a speaker.
“The world is watching and the American people rightly expect their leaders to come together and deliver on these priorities,” White House Office of Management and Budget director Shalanda Young said in a letter to Congress.
“I urge Congress to address them as part of a comprehensive, bipartisan agreement in the weeks ahead.”
Biden’s mega aid package yokes a host of disparate crises together in the hope that an appeal to US national unity will help shake House Republicans out of their dysfunction.
And it throws an olive branch to Republicans in the form of $6.4 billion (€6 billion) in funding for the migration crisis at the southern border with Mexico – a central concern for the right-wing party.
“It’s a smart investment that’s going to pay dividends for American security for generations,” Biden said last night.
Biden hopes combining all the issues into one piece of legislation will create the necessary political coalition for congressional approval.

The package also includes $7 billion (€6.6 billion) for countering China and strengthening allies in the Asia-Pacific region, and over $9 billion (€8.5 billion) for humanitarian assistance for Gaza, Ukraine and Israel.

But most importantly, however, the huge funding ask is an attempt to bolster waning support for Ukraine by linking it with funding for Israel – which does have widespread bipartisan backing.
There is considerable support in Congress for Ukraine, including among prominent Republicans in the Senate, where the Democrats hold the majority.
Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer promised quick action in the upper house.
“Senate Democrats will move expeditiously on this request, and we hope that our Republican colleagues across the aisle will join us to pass this much-needed funding,” he said in a statement.
“This legislation is too important to wait for the House to settle their chaos.”
However, it’s not clear that even if Republicans set aside their squabbling and choose a speaker they would then agree to pass more aid for Ukraine.
A growing number of Republicans – and US voters in general – oppose to adding to the $43.9 billion (€41.4 billion) in security assistance that the United States has committed to Ukraine since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.
An earlier request for aid for Ukraine was stalled when Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a rebellion in September.
In the 17 days since, no Republican has been able to get enough support from the party to replace him. The latest to try, Donald Trump-ally Jim Jordan, failed for a third time on Friday.
Biden’s speech last night drew the link between the wars in Ukraine and Israel as part of a vision of the US as a “beacon to the world” confronting “terrorists” like Hamas and “tyrants” like Putin.
It was Biden’s bid to remind Americans of the decades-long US geopolitical stance as leader of the Western democracies.
The Kremlin on Friday denounced Biden’s comments.
“We do not accept such a tone in relation to the Russian Federation, in relation to our president,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Peskov said such “rhetoric is hardly suitable for responsible leaders of states, and it can hardly be acceptable to us.”
US efforts to “contain” Russia would prove ineffective, he added.
Biden, meanwhile, welcomed European Union leaders Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen to the White House on Friday, at a summit set to deliver a message of unity on conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.

Higgins says blocking of essential food is 'criminal' as aid trucks wait to cross into Gaza,"PRESIDENT MICHAEL D Higgins has said that “the blocking of essential food is criminal”, as a UN convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian supplieswaits to enter Gaza this evening.
Speaking toThe Journalon the sidelines of the UN’s World Food Forum in Rome, President Higgins noted that the UN World Food Programme was already looking after hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza before Israel told one million Gazans to flee the north of the densely populated area as it prepares for a ground invasion, and the situation has now deteriorated.
Higgins said the issue of opening the Rafah crossing into Gaza from Egypt “has been going on for a very long time”.
A deal to allow a convoy of 20 trucks to deliver aid to Gaza was brokered between US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during Biden’s visit to Israel on Wednesday.
Biden later secured an agreement from Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi that he would reopen the Rafah crossing to allow the trucks to enter Gaza.
President Higgins said that there was “very strong opinion in Israel that wants Israel to stay within the realm of international law”.
He added that Ireland’s “position is a strong position” and the country’s “approach has always been in support of the right of Israel to exist”. He said he had spoken to Israel’s President Isaac Herzog twice in the past 12 months.
“So there are no binary choices here for people who really want peace in the region and people who want aid to go immediately, without delay, to those who need it, and also to be able to speak about the genuine, real aspirations of people,” President Higgins said.
“For example, if you say that you’re in favour of the two state solution, long ago, some of us were saying that that Palestinian state has to be contiguous, it has to be viable, it has to have status, it has to have access to the sea and so forth. And that is the basis of a conversation. But these conversations were allowed to to to lapse,” President Higgins said.

President Higgins is at the end of a five-day trip to Rome which included a private audience with Pope Francis and a meeting with Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella.
Earlier this week, President Higgins hit out at Israel’s actions in its war with Hamas, which began on 7 October when Hamas launched deadly attacks in Israel that have killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians. Authorities in the Gaza Strip have said 4,137 people have been killed and over 13,000 wounded in Israeli airstrikes in the Palestinian enclave.
After delivering a keynote address to the opening session of the World Food Forum on Monday, President Higgins told reporters thatIsrael had reduced the Geneva Convention to “tatters”.
Then yesterday, following a private audience with Pope Francis, President Higgins told reporters thatIsrael risks falling into the same “category” as Hamas.
Today, President Higgins used his keynote address to the closing session of the World Food Forum to call for global leaders to “tackle the vicious circle of global poverty and inequality, global hunger, debt and climate change”.

He also criticised debts which are placed on developing nations and called for changes within the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
President Higgins also commended young people for being at the vanguard of efforts to tackle climate change” and called for them to be “participants” and not mere “attendees” at events such as these.
He added that women are the “most impacted victims of the food crisis” despite producing up to 80% of foodstuffs.
President Higgins said any efforts to combat global hunger must “prioritise the inclusion of women and girls who are more food insecure than men in every region of the world” by enshrining their right to land.
In addition to delivering a keynote address, President Higgins was also part of a panel discussion with youth activists.

WHO's Mike Ryan says agreed convoy of 20 aid trucks for Gaza 'is a drop in the ocean of need',"
THE EMERGENCIES DIRECTOR of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Mike Ryan, has criticised the decision to allow a convoy of 20 trucks to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, saying it “should be 2,000″.
The deal to allow the convoy of 20 trucks to deliver aid was brokered between Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the US President’s visit to the country on Wednesday.
Biden later secured an agreement from Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi that he would reopen the Rafah crossing to allow the trucks to enter Gaza.
But Ryan has said that efforts to get aid across the Egyptian border – the only route into or out of Gaza not controlled by Israel – needed to go beyond the “gesture” of the first convoy.
“We need to make sure the corridor is a corridor. Humanitarian assistance needs to move every day. Twenty trucks is a drop in the ocean of need right now in Gaza,” he said.
“Hopefully this trickle will turn into a river of aid that will flow in the coming days.”
Ryan also said that Gazan hospitals ran out of fuel “days ago”.
“The fuel is gone. What’s left are tiny amounts of fuel that are being repurposed within the UN and NGO system to desperately try to provide a couple of days’ extra fuel, where that can be done,” he said.
“We passed the cliff edge long ago.”
Today, the United Nations said the first aid delivery into the besieged enclave should take place “in the next day or so”.
Some 175 lorries crammed with desperately needed medicines, food, and water stretched into the distance at the Rafah crossing with Egypt, which has removed concrete roadblocks and is scrambling to repair the route into Gaza.

Palestinians are in dire need of food and water after relentless bombing by Israel, still reeling from the bloodiest attack in its history.
Egyptian state-linked broadcaster Al Qahera News had said the Rafah crossing — the only route into Gaza — would open today, but Cairo later said it needed more time to repair roads.

“We are in deep and advanced negotiations with all relevant sides to ensure that an aid operation in Gaza starts as quickly as possible… a first delivery is due to start in the next day or so,” the UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said, quoted by his spokesman Jens Laerke in Geneva.
Laerke told reporters: “I do not have an exact time for when these movements will take place, of course, with the hope that they can begin as soon as possible, in a way that is safe, secure and hopefully sustained.
“We need to have the mechanism in place whereby this can be driven into southern Gaza. That does not take away from our call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.”
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited the Rafah crossing to personally oversee preparations, as workmen operating bulldozers on the Gazan side battled to make the road passable.
Medicine, water purifiers and blankets were being unloaded at El Arish airport near Gaza, an AFP reporter saw, with Ahmed Ali, head of the Egyptian Red Crescent, saying he was getting “two to three planes of aid a day”.

Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the Islamist militant group launched an unprecedented raid from the Gaza Strip on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians shot, mutilated or burned to death, according to Israeli officials.
Hamas gunmen also kidnapped some 200 hostages including foreigners from around two dozen countries ranging from Paraguay to Tanzania. The majority are still alive, the Israeli army said Friday.
In response, Israeli bombers have levelled entire city blocks in Gaza in preparation for a ground invasion they say is coming soon. The Hamas-run health ministry said 4,137 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in the onslaught.
Israeli jets pounded more than 100 Hamas targets in Gaza overnight, the army said, with AFP reporters hearing loud explosions and witnessing plumes of smoke billowing from the northern Gaza Strip.
Embracing front-line soldiers and clad in body armour, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged them to “fight like lions” and “win with full force”.
Fists clenched and voice raised, Netanyahu told cheering troops: “We will deal harsh blows to our enemies in order to achieve victory.”
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told some of the tens of thousands of personnel preparing the ground invasion that “the order will come soon.”
Earlier today, the Israeli army announced plans to evacuate the northern city of Kiryat Shmona after days of clashes with Hezbollah fighters along the border with Lebanon.
“A short while ago, the Northern Command informed the mayor of the city of the decision. The plan will be managed by the local authority, the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Defence,” the military said in a statement.
Israel’s military said its forces continued to target Hezbollah targets as tensions grew along the border.
“The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) carried out a number of attacks against Hezbollah infrastructure, including observation posts,” the army said early Friday.
“In addition, IDF fighter jets struck three terrorists who attempted to launch anti-tank missiles toward Israel.”
Israeli authorities have been steadily evacuating communities across the northern frontier, as reservists and columns of tanks and armoured vehicles poured into the area.

Besieged Palestinians await arrival of aid trucks promised in deal struck by Biden,"
PALESTINIANS IN WAR-torn Gaza are awaiting the arrival of emergency aid promised in a deal struck by US President Joe Biden, as Israel’s military kept up its bombardment of targets in the Hamas-run enclave.
Cargo planes delivered stocks including food and medicine, water purifiers and hygiene products to Egypt’s El Arish airport, awaiting the opening of the Rafah border crossing to Gaza.
Egyptian state-linked broadcaster Al Qahera News said the crossing – the only one into and out of the besieged enclave not controlled by Israel – would open tomorrow.
On a visit to Cairo, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said there needed to be “rapid, unimpeded humanitarian access” after dire warnings about the impact of the sustained Israeli blockade.
“We need food, water, medicine and fuel now. We need it at scale and we need it to be sustained, it is not one small operation that is required,” he added.
In Geneva, the emergencies director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Michael Ryan, said aid needed to get in “every day”, calling the deal struck by Biden with Israel and Egypt to allow in 20 trucks “a drop in the ocean of need right now”.
“It shouldn’t be 20 trucks: it should be 2,000 trucks,” he said.

Gaza has been hit by a relentless barrage of Israeli fire in retaliation for a Hamas militant attack on 7 October, which Israel said killed at least 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
Some 1,500 Islamist fighters were killed in clashes before the army regained control, the Israeli military said.
Israeli bombing in turn has killed at least 3,785 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Gaza health ministry.
Entire city blocks have been levelled, displacing more than one million of the 2.4 million population, the UN has said.
“The pace of death, of suffering, of destruction … cannot be exaggerated,” said UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths.
There are fears of worse to come if Israel launches an expected ground invasion to destroy Hamas and rescue more than 200 Israeli and foreign hostages.
Biden, on a flying visit to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet on Wednesday, reiterated strong US support for its long-time ally but also stressed the need to address the plight of Palestinian civilians.
Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II today condemned what they said was the “collective punishment” of Gazans.
They also warned about the conflict spreading, with anger across the Middle East at Israel and its Western allies.
“If the war does not stop”, it threatens “to plunge the entire region into catastrophe”, a statement from the Jordanian royal court read.
Sisi and Abdullah, whose countries were the first Arab states to make peace with Israel in 1979 and 1994, are seen as key mediators between Israel and the Palestinians.
They had been due to have four-way talks with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and Biden. But Amman cancelled the summit.
Cairo has so far kept the Rafah crossing closed, pointing to repeated Israeli strikes near the checkpoint and voicing fears that Israel may be hoping to permanently drive Palestinians out and into Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula.

The UN World Food Programme said it has 951 tonnes of food at or on the way to Rafah – enough to feed 488,000 people for one week, a spokesperson said.
On the Gaza side of the border, scores of people waited, desperate to flee but mindful of any new Israeli shelling.
“We’re ready with our bags,” said one man who gave his name only as Mohammed, 40, and said he works for a European institution.
He said he had been waiting “for three days with my family, in a house 10 minutes away from the crossing” but had received no information so far.
Biden, who will make a televised address tonight about the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts, announced the aid deal after what he called “blunt” talks in Israel and a phone call with Sisi.

Israel consented to the deal while pressing on with its military campaign.
Its army reported today that it had destroyed hundreds more Hamas targets, including a missile launch site and tunnels, and that “more than 10 terrorists were eliminated”.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to crush Hamas after the worst attack in the country’s 75-year history.
Biden strongly backed Israel but warned it not to overreact, cautioning that Washington made mistakes as it sought to avenge 9/11.
Netanyahu today called Israel’s fightback a “just war”, adding: “I’ve never seen the people of Israel as united – more united – than they are now.”
But intensifying cross-border fire between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon is stoking fears of a potential second front.
As tensions mounted, the United States, UK and Germany today advised their citizens to leave Lebanon while flights were still available.
The US State Department also issued a rare “worldwide caution” advisory for its citizens, citing terrorism and the potential for anti-American protests.
Hamas military spokesman Abu Obeida called for protests at Israeli and US embassies, “to have them closed and their ambassadors expelled from all Arab and Muslim countries”.
The Arab world has been united in anger and condemnation of Israel since a deadly strike hit a Gaza hospital compound on Tuesday.
Israel temporarily recalled its diplomats from Turkey as a security precaution and called on citizens to leave the country as soon as possible.
Both sides in the war have traded blame for the bloody carnage, but neither the provenance of the strike nor the death toll could immediately be independently verified.
The strike left scores of bodies and charred cars at the Ahli Arab hospital compound in northern Gaza, AFP images showed.

Hamas accused Israel of hitting the hospital during its massive bombing campaign and Gaza’s health ministry put the death toll at 471.
Israel blamed a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket – a claim backed by Biden – pointing to the lack of a large impact crater typical of its air strikes, and said fuel from the errant rocket exploded.
A senior European intelligence source told AFP that he believed a maximum of 50 people were killed.
Hamas has dismissed Israel’s position, saying its “outrageous lies do not deceive anyone”, and slammed the United States, accusing it of being complicit in the ongoing strikes on Gaza.
The Hamas-controlled interior ministry this evening said several displaced people who had taken shelter at a church compound in the Gaza Strip have been killed and injured after what it says was an Israeli strike this evening.
The strike left a “large number of martyrs and injured” at the compound of the Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyrius Church, the ministry said.
Witnesses told AFP the strike appeared to have been aimed at a target close to the place of worship where many Gaza residents had taken refuge as the war raged in the Palestinian enclave.
The Israeli army when contacted told AFP it was checking the reported strike.
Witnesses said the strike damaged the facade of the church and caused an adjacent building to collapse, adding that many injured people were evacuated to hospital.
Saint Porphyrius is the oldest church still in use in Gaza and is located in the city’s historic neighbourhood.
The Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem expressed its “strongest condemnation” of the strike at its church compound.
“Targeting churches and their institutions, along with the shelters they provide to protect innocent citizens, especially children and women who have lost their homes due to Israeli airstrikes on residential areas over the past 13 days, constitutes a war crime that cannot be ignored,” the Patriarchate said in a statement.
The church is not far from the Al-Ahli Arab hospital.

Israel denied it was involved.President Joe Biden and other US officials have already said that US intelligence officials believed the explosion was not caused by an Israeli air strike.The US assessment noted “only light structural damage” to the hospital itself was evident, with no impact crater visible.19 Oct 20239:55PMUnited Nations peacekeepers have said one person was killed today after civilians were caught in cross-border fire in Lebanon’s south.Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah and allied Palestinian factions have been trading cross-border fire with Israel daily since Hamas launched its massive 7 October assault on Israel.Lebanese armed forces asked for help from the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which acts as a buffer between Lebanon and Israel, “for seven individuals stranded near” the border during “a significant exchange of fire”, UNIFIL said in a statement.A spokesperson confirmed they were all civilians.“Tragically, one person lost his life during this incident and the others were successfully rescued,” the UNIFIL said. They asked the Israeli forces to suspend fire “to facilitate the rescue operation” and they complied, the statement added.The incident brings to at least 22 the number of people killed in south Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began. Most of them have been combatants, but at least four civilians, including a Reuters journalist, have been killed. At least three people have been killed in Israel.UNIFIL contacted the IDF, urging them to cease fire in order to facilitate the rescue operation.The IDF suspended fire, allowing the LAF to extract the individuals from the area.Tragically, one person lost his life during this incident and the others were successfully rescued.— UNIFIL (@UNIFIL_)October 19, 202319 Oct 20239:38PMThe Hamas-controlled

reported, the Pentagon has said a US Navy ship shot down missiles and drones that had been fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen, possibly at Israel.Three “land-attack cruise missiles and several drones” were intercepted by a destroyer, a spokesman told reporters.The attack had been conducted from Yemen and “potentially toward targets in Israel.”AFP has reported the ship, USS Carney, was patrolling in the Red Sea as part of a heavily reinforced US military presence ordered by President Joe Biden to maintain stability in the wake of war between Israel and the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip.The Pentagon spokesman said that missiles were fired from Yemen where the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels are at war with a government backed by a Saudi-led coalition.According to the spokesman, there were no US casualties and “we cannot say for certain what these missiles were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen, heading north along the Red Sea”.“Our defensive response was one we would have taken for any similar threat in the region,” he said.“We have the capability to defend our broader interests in the region and to deter regional escalation and broader expansion of the conflict that began with Hamas’ attack on Israeli civilians.”Biden has ordered increased air and naval assets – including dispatching two aircraft carriers– to the Middle East to guard against the Israel-Hamas war spilling over in the tinderbox region.On Tuesday, the Pentagon also ordered 2,000 personnel on standby for potential deployment.19 Oct 20238:54PMBREAKING: A US Navy ship has shot down

PhotoThe US veto on a UN Security Council resolution calling for a “humanitarian pause” in the Israel-Hamas war will have “monstruous consequences”, Russia has said.12 out of 15 Council members voted in favour of the resolution put forward by Brazil, which also condemned the “heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas”.The United States was the only vote against, but as one of the body’s five permanent members it counted as a veto.“In the context of a standoff that is deepening and risks spilling over the borders of the Middle East region and taking on a confessional dimension, the consequences of such a step are monstruous,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement.Moscow said it was “disappointing” that a resolution that could have contributed to “stopping the escalation of tensions and reducing violence against civilians” was not adopted.The US veto “clearly demonstrates Washington’s true aspiration for the region”, the statement said.“Every day of delay means not only a rapid increase in the number of dead and wounded, but also the continuation of the suffering of civilians who have become prisoners of the blockaded enclave” of Gaza, it added.The foreign ministry accused Washington of opposing “all humanitarian initiatives from the beginning” and said the Israel-Hamas conflict reflected “the failure of American policy” in the region, which “sparked the catastrophic current escalation”.“The right to self-defence does not mean having a licence for mass and indiscriminate reprisals,” the ministry added, in a criticism aimed at Israel.19 Oct 20237:40PMBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is in Saudi Arabia this evening for the second leg of his Middle East tour following his visit to Israel earlier.Sunak and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman agreed that the “loss of innocent lives in Israel and Gaza over the last two weeks has been horrific”, Downing Street said following their meeting.I've landed in Saudi Arabia.As an international community,

escalation.pic.twitter.com/mwUXn0luSS— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak)October 19, 2023Sunak “encouraged” Saudi Arabia to use its influence to “support stability” in the region.“They underscored the need to avoid any further escalation in the region and agreed to co-ordinate action on this front,” a No 10 statement on the meeting said.“The Prime Minister and crown prince agreed on the pressing need for humanitarian access into Gaza to provide vital water, food and medicine.“The Prime Minister outlined the steps the UK has taken to address the increasingly urgent humanitarian situation, including announcing £10 million of further aid.“The Prime Minister encouraged the crown prince to use Saudi’s leadership in the region to support stability, both now and in the long-term.“More broadly, the Prime Minister and crown prince looked forward to working together to advance areas of shared interest for the UK and Saudi Arabia, including on upholding regional security.”19 Oct 20237:30PMThousands gathered for a pro-Palestinian protest in the heart of Paris today, after authorities lifted a ban put in place immediately after the Hamas attack on Israel.A Paris court today suspended the ban that had been put on the protest in Place de la Republique in central Paris.Thousands had already gathered for the rally, which started off peacefully, but later saw clashes with police, who used pepper spray to disperse the crowd, according to AFP journalists at the scene.Watch live: Pro-Palestine protest held in Paris after eight killed in West Bankhttps://t.co/pKZITxuMKf— The Independent (@Independent)October 19, 2023Last week Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin had called on regional authorities to ban all pro-Palestinian demonstrations, highlighting a spike in anti-Semitic incidents in the wake of the latest violence in Israel and Gaza.But the Paris court said that bans imposed by regional prefects were “a serious and clearly illegal threat to the freedom to protest”.President Emmanuel Macron said it had been justified to block pro-Palestinian demonstrations immediately after the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel.“I think there was a period of decency – there had been a terrorist attack, it wasn’t good,” he said earlier today in an exchange with students in the street witnessed by AFP.“I see people who want to demonstrate peacefully but there are hyper-radical elements who are going to burn the Israeli flag and defend Hamas,” Macron added.19 Oct 20236:43PMThe United States’ State Department has extended its ‘caution’ alert to all US travellers citing terrorism and potential for anti-American demonstrators.Earlier, this liveblog reported that US Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, advised US citizens in Lebanon “to make plans to depart as soon as possible while commercial options are still available”.The US, Ireland and the United Kingdom have all warned not to travel to the country.Tensions between militant group Hezbollah and the Israeli Defence Forces have risen in the last number of days. Yesterday, the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement called for a “day of rage” to condemn the strike on al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza on Tuesday.The State Department urged Americans to “stay alert in locations frequented by tourists” and to enroll in a program known as STEP, which allows citizens to be located more quickly in case of emergency.19 Oct 20236:06PM16 Palestinian journalists have been killed in the war in Gaza since Israel began bombarding the coastal enclave, the Palestinian journalists’ union said today.Dozens of other journalists have been wounded in the conflict since it erupted on 7 October after Hamas militants carried out a deadly attack on Israel that triggered a blistering Israeli bombardment of the Palestinian territory.19 Oct 20235:22PMThe US State Department has today issued a “worldwide caution security alert” for all citizens abroad.The alert says:“Due to increased tensions in various locations around the world, the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against US citizens and interests, the Department of State advises US citizens overseas to exercise increased caution.”It says US citizens should star alert in locations frequented by tourists.More can be read here.19 Oct 20235:17PMEarlier today, the European Parliament approved a joint motion for a resolution on recent events in Israel and Gaza and called for an immediate de-escalation of the conflict.The motion, which called for a “humanitarian pause” to the conflict, was supported by nine of Ireland’s 13 members of the European Parliament (MEPs).The joint motion for a resolution on “the despicable terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel, Israel’s right to defend itself in line with humanitarian and international law and the humanitarian situation in Gaza” was voted on and approved today.Clare Daly, Mick Wallace, Luke Ming Flanaghan and Chris MacManus were the only Irish MEPs to vote against the motion.Here’s what Luke Ming Flanaghan told the Parliament earlier:Today in the European Parliament I called for@vonderleyento resign.pic.twitter.com/e5dKGIf33s— Luke 'Ming' Flanagan (@lukeming)October 19, 202319 Oct 20235:14PMPA News is reporting that Israel’s defence minister has promised a ground invasion of Gaza, telling troops to be ready to see territory “from the inside”.

Twenty trucks is a drop in the ocean of need right now in Gaza,” he told reporters.At the same press conference Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s chief, said he is worried about the chances of humanitarian aid reaching the Gaza Strip tomorrow from Egypt, given the delays thus far.“We have been waiting for more than six days since the supplies have been delivered to the border area… We hope there will be a crossing tomorrow but, for sure, based on the experience we had the last few days, we are also at the same time worried whether this will happen.”19 Oct 20234:38PMDemonstration on SaturdayA demonstration in solidarity with Palestine will be held in Dublin city on Saturday, beginning at the Garden of Remembrance at 1pm.

It was an important international signal that other parliaments should follow – the world must demand that Israel ends the siege and the attacks on Gaza and the Palestinian people,” Carthy said today.“We know from Irish history that a lasting and just peace requires negotiations and world leaders acting in good faith. A lasting and just peace between Palestine and Israel requires an end to the occupation and apartheid systems currently imposed on the Palestinian people.“The events of the past weeks have created a new urgency to the need for decisive international intervention. Rigorous international leadership means demanding immediate ceasefires. That is the call from the Dáil, it must be followed by other parliaments and political leaders.”19 Oct 20234:32PMPalestinians are under constant bombardment by Israeli air strikes, as the death toll mounts.

There is no third option,” Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said.Hamas spokesmen have responded that the Palestinian Islamist group is “not scared”.Security sources outside Gaza say Deif and Sinwar have been embedded in the enclave’s network of tunnels — built to resist Israel’s air assault — since hundreds of Hamas fighters crossed the border to hit kibbutz communities, towns and military bases.19 Oct 20233:26PMOur reporter Liam Coates spoke to Cork-based chef Habib Al Ostaz yesterday evening.The 27-year-old, who works at Palestinian restaurant the Izz Cafe in Cork City, said he was currently unable to concentrate on anything but the news from Gaza.Communication with family members still in Gaza is often impossible, he said.“Last time I called them, they had no water and no food. The situation is really bad there – no electricity, no water, food or medicine. And no one can help.”Habib said that amid the turmoil he had been lifted by support from the Irish community in recent days.“Many, many people are calling and asking about my family. I am very grateful for them.”The restaurant has partnered with the Dublin-based charity Human Appeal Ireland, which has set up an appeal for the people of Gaza.While he encouraged as many people as possible to donate to charity and attend protests, he ultimately sounded a helpless tone.“We can’t do anything.

One is an axis of evil led by Iran through Hezbollah, Hamas and others that want to bring back the Middle East to the Middle Ages, to an age of bondage and war and slavery and annihilation.“And the other forces – the forces of progress and humanity – that want to push the Middle East into a world of peace and prosperity,” the Israeli leader said.19 Oct 20232:37PMThe United States Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, has today updated its travel advising US citizens in Lebanon “to make plans to depart as soon as possible while commercial options are still available”.Earlier, this liveblog reported that tensions between militant group Hezbollah and the Israeli Defence Forces have risen in the last number of days, as the IDF continue its fight against Hamas in Gaza.Yesterday, the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement called for a “day of rage” to condemnthe strike on al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza on Tuesday.“The Department of State reminds citizens to avoid demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests as some of these have turned violent,”it said in an update this afternoon.19 Oct 20232:16PMIsraeli forces killed seven Palestinians in multiple incidents across the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry has said.The death toll is mounting in the West Bank territory while war rages in Gaza as at least 73 Palestinians have been killed in the region since conflict erupted on 7 October.The latest fatalities were four people killed during an “attack by the occupation (Israel)” on Nur Shams refugee camp in the northern West Bank, the ministry said.Health officials earlier announced another Palestinian, a 16-year-old boy, was killed by Israeli forces in the camp.The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the Nur Shams fatalities when contacted by AFP journalists.Troops were “continuing to operate in the camp to thwart terror activity”, an army statement said.19 Oct 20232:13PMNo EUFA competition matches to be played in IsraelEUFA, the European soccer organisation, said after a “thorough evaluation of the current safety and security situation in the whole territory of Israel” its Executive Committee has decided that no competition matches shall be played in Israel until further notice.“The Israel Football Association and its clubs Maccabi Haifa FC and Maccabi Tel-Aviv have been requested to propose alternative venues/stadiums (which must comply with all applicable UEFA regulations) outside the territory of Israel for their home matches to be used for as long as this decision remains in force,” it said in a statement today.Retired-Irish footballer Robbie Keane is currently Maccabi Tel-Aviv’s head coach –he fled the country shortly after the 7 October terror-attack by Hamas.Separately, the organisation announced that the Belgium V Sweden, which wasabandoned at half-time due to a terror attack in Brussels on Monday, will not be replayed, EUFA announced this afternoon.The game’s final score will be 1-1, the score reached at half time.Two matches for Israeli teams have been postponed:Villarreal CF vs Maccabi Haifa has been postponed to 6 December 2023Maccabi Tel Aviv vs Zorya Luhansk has been postponed to 25 November 2023Full report from The42here.19 Oct 20232:01PMThe Department of Foreign Affairs updated its travel advice for those going to Lebanon.Its website, updated yesterday, states “Do not travel”.Tensions between militant group Hezbollah and the Israeli Defence Forces have risen in the last number of days, as the IDF continue its fight against Hamas in Gaza.Internally, the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement called for a “day of rage”, yesterday, to condemnthe strike on al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza on Tuesday.Hundreds of demonstrators gathered at the French and US embassies in protest..@alexrossiSKYreports from Beirut where smoke is billowing from the road leading to the US embassy.Crowds of people have gathered in Lebanon to protest what they say is US complicity in war crimes in Gaza -

European Commission official offers to meet protestors occupying the EC's Dublin offices,"LAST UPDATE|19 Oct 2023
PALESTINE SOLIDARITY ACTIVISTS have occupied a European Commission office in Dublin, calling for the EU to take a stance against Israel’s attacks on Gaza.
Around 10 protesters entered the building housing the EU Commission Representation in Ireland seeking a meeting with the head of the representation, with more demonstrating outside.

Barbara Nolan said: “We fully respect the right of people to protest peacefully. These young people have not disrupted working arrangements and are making their voices heard. We are here to listen and understand their concerns. I have offered to meet with them.”
Commenting on the occupation, Councillor John Lyons said that “across the world, people are mobilising and demonstrating in solidarity with the people of Gaza and Palestine, including in Irelandwhere we share a common history of colonialism with the Palestinian people”.
Dublin for Gaza member David Landy said the EU is “offering full vocal support to these atrocities in defiance of any norms of international law and in defiance of the wishes of decent European citizens”.
“We believe that Israel’s campaign of mass murder and ethnic cleansing amounts to an act of genocide, under the legal definition adopted by the United Nations,” Landy said.
“We are occupying the EU Commission offices as an act of protest against EU complicity in these genocidal acts.”
Lamia Tadjine added: “Let us be clear – blood is on the hands, not just of the Israeli military and leadership, but on the hands of those states and institutions who have provided cover for these atrocities, such as the European Union.”

Rishi Sunak tells Benjamin Netanyahu 'we want you to win' during visit to Israel,"LAST UPDATE|19 Oct 2023
UK PRIME MINISTER Rishi Sunak has told Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu that he welcomed the decision to allow aid into Gaza.
Sunak, who No 10 confirmed will travel to Saudi Arabia later today, thanked Netanyahu for Tel Aviv’s support in attempting to free British nationals who are being held hostage by Hamas and said the UK wants Israel to win its battle against the militant group.
Sunak has followed US President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s lead in travelling to Israel to personally offer condolences for Hamas’s attack on 7 October which left hundreds of Israelis dead and saw almost 200 people taken hostage.
Ahead of meetings with Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog, Sunak met the families of British hostages.
In a press conference following his meeting with Netanyahu, Sunak said: “I want to thank you for the support that your government has given to the families of British nationals caught up in this horror, including your efforts to release the hostages, to secure their release.
“And I know that we will continue to cooperate, particularly with regard to British nationals that are involved.
He also welcomed Netanyahu’s decision, after lobbying by Biden, to allow Israel to start letting aid into Gaza.

It marks a potential break in a punishing siege on the territory after Israel’s retaliation on Hamas saw it block access for water, food, electricity and other essential supplies to the 25-mile strip, while also carrying out strikes.
During his meeting with Herzog, Sunak said: “Palestinians are victims of what Hamas has done and it’s important that we continue to provide humanitarian access.”
Addressing the media after meeting with Netanyahu, Sunak reiterated that Palestinians living in Gaza are victims of Hamas and welcomed the decision to ensure that routes into the enclave will be opened for humanitarian aid to enter.

“I’m glad that you made that decision. We will support it, we are increasing our aid to the region and we will look to get more support to people as quickly as we can,” he said.
In his own address, Netanyahu recalled Britain’s part in the Second World War as he urged “continuous” UK support during a war that he said is likely to have “ups and downs”.
He told Sunak during their joint press conference: “Eighty years ago, Prime Minister, the civilised world stood with you in your darkest hour.
“This is our darkest hour. It is the world’s darkest hour. We need to stand together and we will win.
“And this is why I support… I value your support and the fact that you’re here – we must win together.”
Sunak said he was “proud to stand here with you in Israel’s darkest hour as your friend”.
He added: “We will stand with you in solidarity, we will stand with your people. And we also want you to win.”

No 10 confirmed that Sunak will next travel to Saudi Arabia, an influential player in the Middle East, to hold talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The British leader’s two-day trip is expected to allow Sunak to make his plea for Hamas’s incursion, and Israel’s subsequent reply, not to spark a wider conflict in the volatile region.
It comes as the UK continues to go through the evidence before coming to a conclusion over who was responsible for the bombing of al Ahli hospital in Gaza City, a blast that left hundreds dead.
With both sides blaming each other – and the US backing Israel’s protestations – Downing Street said Britain’s intelligence services are still “reviewing the facts available”.
Speaking to broadcasters after his conversation with the Israeli premier – which UK media was shut out of – Sunak said Hamas “represent pure evil” following its chilling assault, as he defended Israel’s right to self-defence.

But he stressed that “no-one wants to see” the “barbaric act of terrorism” lead to further violence.
“It is important that the conflict doesn’t escalate regionally. That is why I’m talking to as many people as I can across the region,” he said.
“I’ve already done that and I’ll be able to see more people in person on this trip.
“No-one wants to see this conflict escalate. And indeed the UK has sent various military assets into the Mediterranean to prevent regional escalation.
“Some of our surveillance aircraft, for example, are ensuring that arms shipments don’t find their way to people like Hezbollah.”
The UK Foreign Office has since updated its travel guidance to Lebanon, home to Hamas ally Hezbollah and a country that shares a border with Israel, advising against all travel to the country and encouraging British nationals currently there to “leave now while commercial options remain available”.
Rami Mortada, Lebanon’s ambassador to the UK, said the Israeli-Hamas conflict is “out of everybody’s hands” and has the “potential to spill into a regional conflict”.
He told Times Radio: “If the situation in Gaza worsens, it would be very difficult to contain the conflict in its original theatre of operation.”
In parallel to Sunak’s travel, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly will visit Egypt, Turkey and Qatar in the coming days to underscore the UK’s message.
Cleverly said: “It is in no one’s interests – neither Israeli, Palestinian nor the wider Middle East – for others to be drawn into this conflict.
“I am meeting counterparts from influential states in the region to push for calm and stability, facilitate humanitarian access into Gaza and work together to secure the release of hostages.”","7.02am, 19 Oct 2023",Pro-Israel, Sunak's supportive remark to Netanyahu.
No UEFA matches to go ahead in Israel until further notice due to 'security' concerns,"
NO MATCHES ORGANISED by UEFA will be played in Israel “until further notice” due to the “current safety and security situation” in the country.
Israel’s national teams and club sides Maccabi Haifa and Maccabi Tel Aviv, who are both competing in Europe, must find alternative venues outside the country to fulfil their UEFA fixtures.
“After a thorough evaluation of the current safety and security situation in the whole territory of Israel, the UEFA executive committee decided that no UEFA competition matches shall be played in Israel until further notice,” read the statement from European football’s governing body.
“The Israel Football Association and its clubs Maccabi Haifa FC and Maccabi Tel Aviv have been requested to propose alternative venues/stadiums (which must comply with all applicable UEFA regulations) outside the territory of Israel for their home matches to be used for as long as this decision remains in force.”
Maccabi Tel Aviv are managed by record Ireland goalscorer Robbie Keane. Their scheduled Europa Conference League game for Thursday week against Zorya Luhansk has been postponed to Saturday, November 25.
Israel’s national team were due to stage Euro 2024 qualifiers against Switzerland and Romania – the two teams above them in Group I – in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem respectively next month.
Meanwhile, the Belgium-Sweden Euro 2024 qualifier that was halted following the fatal shooting of two Swedish fans will not be replayed and the points will be shared.

As per the wishes of the two countries’ FAs, the 1-1 result at half-time, when the match was stopped, has been “confirmed as final” and “each team is awarded one point with the Group F standings to be updated”, said UEFA.
On Monday, two Swedish supporters were killed near Brussels city centre in a suspected Islamist gun attack.
The encounter went ahead as scheduled that evening before being abandoned at the request of the two teams at half-time with the score 1-1.
The travelling Sweden fans were kept in the King Baudouin Stadium before being escorted by the police to their hotels at 2 am local time.
The suspected attacker, a 45-year-old Tunisian national living illegally in Belgium, was fatally shot in a police operation on Tuesday.
“We are pleased to hear that UEFA has come to a decision and that the decision is in line with what both federations wished for. However, sporting matters are secondary, our thoughts are with the victims and their families,” said the Belgian FA in a statement.
On Tuesday, FIFA president Gianni Infantino took to Instagram to say that he was “shocked” and “saddened” by the shootings.
Belgium are already qualified for Euro 24 while Sweden had already been mathematically eliminated.

President Higgins: Israel must not fall into same 'category' as Hamas by breaking international law,"President Higgins signing a book on the occasion of laying a wreath in honour of Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty at the VaticanDiarmuid Pepper / The JournalDiarmuid Pepper / The Journal / The Journal
Diarmuid Pepper reporting from Rome
PRESIDENT MICHAEL D Higgins has said Israel must not put itself in the same “category” as Hamas, adding that Israel is “taking great risks”.
Following a private audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican today, President Higgins spoke to reporters about his meeting with the Pontiff as well as the ongoing conflict in Gaza.
On Saturday, 7 October Hamas gunmen burst through the heavily militarised border around the Gaza Strip and killed more than 1,300 people, mainly civilians.
Many of those killed were at a music concert, and one of the deceased was 22-year-old Irish-Israeli citizen Kim Damti.
“I understand, when you see the circumstances in which children were killed, when those at an event in relation to music were killed, I have no reservation in accepting and knowing the reaction of the people whose families were affected,” President Higgins told reporters.
He added: “But however bad it is, you must save yourself from going into the same categories.
“If you put yourself into the category of unmediated, unrestrained response, you’re taking great risks I believe.”
During his visit to the Vatican, President Higgins laid a wreath in remembrance of Monsignor Hugh O’Flaherty, whose work during the Nazi occupation of Rome during World War II saved the lives of thousands of people.

When asked how important it is to remember people like Monsignor O’Flaherty when there are reports of a rise in antisemitic acts, President Higgins said: “It is incredibly important as we move on now, from the horrific, horrific events that have taken place, that would be absolutely unequivocal about antisemitic expression.”
However, President Higgins called for people to appreciate the difference between criticising the state of Israel and antisemitism.
“I do think it is incredibly important that the distinction be honoured between those who make criticisms, of any breaches of international law, or indeed of illegal settlements.
“If you’re criticising the state of Israel for illegal settlements, as some of us have done in the past, it’s entirely wrong to be describing that as antisemitic behaviour.
“So we have to get to a sophisticated, honest, straight discussion. Nobody should tolerate antisemitism for a moment, and that’s certainly my view.
“But equally, we must be free to speak about the responsibilities that are there for all states in relation to international law.”
President Higgins also hit out at Israel for “threats” it has made on Gaza.
“I think that to actually threaten that you’re going to have no limitation in your exclusion of water, food, shelter, the threat itself is in fact introducing the likely fact that you’re going to be breaking international law.
President Higgins added: “There are many people in Israel itself, who do not want Israel to be outside of the context of international level, who do not want it to be claiming some impunity to do whatever it likes.”

He also drew a contrast between the efforts put into the Troubles and the efforts put into Israel and Palestine relations, and said there has not been a continuous engagement from civil servants towards relations in the region.
“War makes a stone of the heart,” said President Higgins.
“We have to move on but I think moving on can only be done on sure footing if it is on the basis of principle, and that basis of principle means that you do not allow yourself to drift along with measures that do not accept the full rigours of international law.”
During his trip to Italy, President Higgins has made a number ofcomments about the situation in Israel and Gazaand theinternational community’s response.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was asked today if he felt that President Higgins’ comments put the government in a difficult position, Varadkar said they do not.
“I think it’s well understood around the world that we have a constitutional president, not and executive president. That’s the case and lots of European countries for example,” he told RTÉ’s Claire Byrne.
Varadkar added: “I don’t actually think what the President said is hugely different from what the government’s been saying over the last couple of days.”

President Higgins added that he had an “open” meeting with Pope Francis, discussing topics such as migration, climate change, and the war in Ukraine.
A historic Synod is currently ongoing in the Catholic Church and topics to be addressed include the place of LGBTQ+ people within the Church and whether women should be ordained.
This is also the first Synod where women have the ability to vote in the process.
“The Synod, it is a very important process,” said President Higgins.
He added: “I think very, very much that it is not his view that one is just offering permission to women to attend but also that through the Synod and the outcome of the Synod, there should be a consideration of the role of believers, men and women, in relation to a Church that is changing.”
President Higgins said he and Pope Francis “discussed the role of women” in the Church and on the role of women in the Church, President Higgins said: “Women should be participating fully as equals at every leveland at every policy decision in relation to Church and in its administration, and that’s a journey, even for him.”
President Higgins said he also discussed with Pope Francis his “recent announcement about welcoming the space that would be given to the blessing of civil unions and the position of the LGBT community”.
On the eve of the Synod, a letter published by the Vatican revealed that on the issues of blessing same-sex couples, Pope Francis said “pastoral charity” requires patience and understanding and that priests cannot become judges “who only deny, reject and exclude”.
“I was asked to communicate to him (Pope Francis) the appreciation (of the LGBT community) of what direction in which he was seeking to move,” said President Higgins this afternoon.
President Higgins also told reporters that he “doesn’t give instructions to the Pope”, but added that “the Pope knows of where I stand myself in relation to respecting the expressions of the human body but also expressing it in all its circumstances, cultures and freedoms”.
“He has no difficulty with that,” said President Higgins, “but of course, he faces grave difficulties from the institution of which is the head.
“I think I get a sense of that nearly every time I meet him, but his heart is in the right place.”

EU opens disinformation probes into Meta and TikTok over spread of Israel-Hamas content,"
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION has announced probes into Facebook owner Meta and TikTok, seeking more details on the measures they have taken to stop the spread of “illegal content and disinformation” after the Hamas attack on Israel.
The Commission said it had sent formal requests for information to Meta and TikTok respectively in what is a first procedure launched under the EU’s new law on digital content.
The EU launched a similar probe into billionaire mogul Elon Musk’s social media platform X, formerly Twitter, last week.
It alsoissued warnings to Google and YouTube last weekabout illegal material and disinformation surrounding the war.
The commission said the request to Meta related “to the dissemination and amplification of illegal content and disinformation” around the Hamas-Israel conflict.
In a separate statement, it said it wanted to know more about TikTok’s efforts against “the spreading of terrorist and violent content and hate speech”.

The EU’s executive arm added that it wanted more information from Meta on its “mitigation measures to protect the integrity of elections”.
Meta and TikTok have until 25 October to respond, with a deadline of 8 November for less urgent aspects of the demand for information.
The commission said it also sought more details about how TikTok was complying with rules on protecting minors online.
The European Union has built a powerful armoury to challenge the power of big tech with its landmark Digital Services Act (DSA) and a sister law, the Digital Markets Act, that hits internet giants with tough new curbs on how they do business.

The EU’s fight against disinformation has intensified since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last year and Russian attempts to sway European public opinion.
The issue has gained further urgency after Hamas’ attack on 7 October on Israel and the aftermath which sparked a wave of violent images that flooded the platforms.
The DSA came into effect for “very large” platforms, including Meta and TikTok, that have more than 45 million monthly European users in August.
The DSA bans illegal online content under threat of fines running as high as six percent of a company’s global turnover.
The EU’s top tech enforcer, Thierry Breton, sent warning letters to tech CEOs including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, TikTok’s Shou Zi Chew and Sundar Pichai of YouTube owner Alphabet.
Breton, EU internal market commissioner, told the executives to crack down on illegal content following Hamas’ attack.
Meta said last week that it was putting special resources towards cracking down on illegal and problematic content related to the Hamas-Israel conflict.
On Wednesday, Breton expressed his fears over the impact of disinformation on the EU.
“The widespread dissemination of illegal content and disinformation… carries a clear risk of stigmatisation of certain communities, destabilisation of our democratic structures, not to mention the exposure of our children to violent content,” he said.
AFP fact-checkers have found several posts on Facebook, TikTok and X promoting a fake White House document purporting to allocate $8 billion in military assistance to Israel.
And several platforms have had users passing off material from other conflicts, or even from video games, as footage from Israel or Gaza.
Since the EU’s tougher action on digital behemoths, some companies, including Meta, are exploring whether to offer a paid-for version of their services in the European Union.

As It Happened: Egypt's president agrees to open Gaza border crossing to allow in 20 humanitarian aid trucks,"US PRESIDENT JOE Biden today backed Israel’s account of an explosion at a hospital in Gaza last night during an eight-hour visit to the country.
Biden said that “based on the information we’ve seen to date, it appear it was a result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group on Gaza”.
The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said at least 471 people were killed in the explosion at the al-Ahli Hospital in Northern Gaza.
The ministry said the explosion was caused by an Israeli air strike, but Israel has insisted it is not responsible and in turn blamed the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group.
PIJ is a smaller group than Hamas operating in and it has also also denied responsibility.

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi declared a day of “public mourning” today and said the strike on the hospital would turn against Israel and its US ally.
“The flames of the US-Israeli bombs, dropped this evening on the Palestinian victims injured at the… hospital in Gaza, will soon consume the Zionists,” Raisi said, according to the IRNA agency.
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the British and French embassies in Tehran overnight. Several thousand gathered earlier in Palestine Square in central Tehran to voice their anger.
Iraq
Iraqi Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani called in a statement for an “immediate and urgent resolution” from the UN Security Council to put an end to the “aggression”.
The government has declared three days of mourning for the victims of the strike.
Turkey
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the incident as “the latest example of Israeli attacks devoid of the most basic human values”, in a message on social media.
“I invite all humanity to take action to stop this unprecedented brutality in Gaza,” Erdogan said.
France
French President Emmanuel Macron said “nothing can justify targeting civilians” after the deadly strike on the hospital.
“Humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip must be opened without delay,” he added.
Hezbollah
Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement called for a “day of rage” to condemn a strike on a Gaza Strip hospital, blaming Israel for what it called a “massacre”.
“Let tomorrow, Wednesday, be a day of rage against the enemy,” Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, said in a statement, calling the strike a “massacre” and “brutal crime”.
Hezbollah’s call came as hundreds of demonstrators scuffled with Lebanese security forces outside the US embassy in the Beirut suburb of Awkar, where protesters chanted “Death to America” and “Death to Israel”.
Arab League
Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said “the West must stop this tragedy immediately”.
“Our Arab mechanisms document war crimes, and their perpetrators will not be able to escape justice,” he warned.
WHO
The World Health Organization condemned the deadly strike and demanded the immediate protection of civilians and health care in the strip.
“WHO strongly condemns the attack on Al Ahli Arab Hospital,” the UN health agency said in a statement.
“The hospital was operational, with patients, health- and care-givers, and internally-displaced people sheltering there. Early reports indicate hundreds of fatalities and injuries.”
MSF
Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) condemned the strike on the hospital.
“We are horrified by the recent bombing of the Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City, which was treating patients and hosting displaced Gazans,” it said.
Joe Biden’s wartime visit to the region faltered before it got off the ground last night,after the Jordanian leg of the trip was cancelled following the Gaza hospital strike.
The trip was always set to be a risky mission for the US President as he tried to juggle support for Israel after the 7 October Hamas attacks with efforts to prevent a humanitarian disaster in Gaza and to avert a wider conflict.
His plans were upended last night as he boarded Air Force One when Jordan announced that a planned four-way summit with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, Jordanian King Abdullah II and Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi had been cancelled.
It would be held “when the decision to stop the war and put an end to these massacres has been taken,” said Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi.
Biden later said he was “outraged” by the “explosion” at the hospital and had told his national security team to get more information on what had happened.

At a meeting yesterday, EU leaders struggled to bridge their often contradictory messaging on the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Officials in Brussels have been at loggerheads with each other and member states over the bitterly divisive issue.
A major point of ire for some capitals has been perceptions that European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen has overstepped her remit with her unflinching backing for Israel.
European Council President Charles Michel said yesterday evening that leaders had sought to ensure “maximum coordination” between their countries and Brussels in an emergency virtual meeting.
“It’s a conflict which is generating a lot of fragmentation, of divisions, of polarisation amongst our people, amongst our societies,” Michel told a press conference.
“That’s why we need also to cooperate at European Union level to try to defuse the tensions.”
Michel decried Israel’s “total siege” of Gaza and any strikes on humanitarian infrastructure as not in line with international law.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Dáil yesterdaythat some of the statements made by von der Leyen on the Israel-Hamas war “lacked balance”.
Varadkar later told the European Council meeting that Israel must immediately reverse its decision to cut off water, food, medical and fuel supplies to Gaza.
He said there must be a humanitarian pause in hostilities to provide space in which the immediate humanitarian needs of all civilians in Gaza can be met.
He also told his European counterparts that humanitarian corridors must immediately be created to allow access to vital supplies and to allow EU citizens who wish to leave Gaza to do so safely.

Protesters at the Dáil call for expulsion of Israeli ambassador to Ireland,"AKRAM LIVES IN Ireland with his eight-year-old son. His daughter, who is 26-years-old, is in Gaza with his older brother. Today, after calling many times, he got a voice message from her confirming that she is OK.
“She said she was sending a voice message, just in case I wanted to hear the sound of her voice, because she knows… she knows that I am worried,” he said.
Akram has played that voice message more than once. He was amongst a large crowd that carried out a peaceful demonstration in front of Dáil Eireann in Dublin city today.
The message the crowd was there to deliver is very clear – they want to see the Israeli ambassador in Ireland expelled, as a move of solidarity with the people of Palestine by the Irish Government.
Long after the person with the microphone went home, a Palestinian man with a hoarse voice led the chanting crowd, which was made up of Irish people, Palestinians, and people from other countries living in Ireland.
Multiple speakers gave speeches in which they detailed Israel’s “war crimes”, which included, in their view, the bombing of the Baptist Hospital in Gaza last night. Israel has blamed a militant group for the bombing – the Islamic Jihads – but they have refuted the accusations, and insisted that Israel is responsible.
The full facts of the attack on the hospital are not yet clear.
Two Palestinian women Salem, and Sarah, who attended the protest, said that from what they know, they believe the state of Israel was behind the attack.

Sarah said she came to the protest in “They have killedabout 1,000 children.They demolished houses there in Gaza. They left them without water and food, and electricity, so we have to do something. When you see a hospital being bombed, you have to raise your voice.
“We need stronger support from the Irish Government. The support is appreciated, but we need to see the Israeli ambassador leave, because Ireland can see what is happening with the occupation,” she added.
Her friend Sara said: “We are weak here. We are helpless, there is so little we can do to stand with our brothers and sisters in Gaza, so I have come here to raise my voice, and let people know that this isn’t a religious war taking place.”
“I don’t have family in Gaza, my family are from Haifa. But every single Palestinian in Gaza there is my family. I want to go back to Palestine, but I cannot. We are here because we are weak, and standing here is one of the only things we can do to feel strong,” Salem said.

“We are ok, we are safe, but they are not. They cannot eat, they cannot drink, and we can do so little to help,” she added.
Aziz was there this evening too. He is Palestinian-Irish. He was born here, and has spent his whole life in Ireland with his younger brother Hassam and their family. They have never been to Palestine, but they are in regular contact with their aunt, uncle, and cousins who are in Gaza at the moment.

“We just keep calling until someone picks up. When you hear their voices and you know they are okay in that moment, it’s a relief – but they are under attack. They are told to evacuate but there is nowhere to go. Provisions are low. It is scary to think, what will the outcome be,” he said.
After struggling to reach the centre of the crowd, 24-year-old Aziz asked the organisers of the protest if he could speak.
“If Columbia can expel their Israel ambassador, why can’t we? We can. We must!” he shouted into the megaphone.
“The support I’ve seen, especially from the Irish people, has been incredible, it makes me proud to be from this country as well. We all know that what Israel is doing over the last 12 days isn’t something new, or surprising. It has been doing this for the last 75 years to the Palestinian people.
“Yesterday I saw a video of the European President. She was talking about Ukraine, it was one year ago, in October 2022, she called Russia terrorists for cutting water and supplies from the Ukrainian people, but she didn’t say that about the Palestinians. She said Israel has a right to defend itself,” Aziz said.
The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has been one of the few European leaders to have called on Israel to allowhumanitarian corridorsto be opened into Gaza. He also condemned the targeting of civilian infrastructure, and cutting off water and power in Gaza.
Today, the Tanaiste Micheál Martin approved an immediate aid package of €13m for the people of Palestine, which will be split between the UN relief and works agency, and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The latest resurgence of violence in Palestine and Israel comes after Israel declared all out war, and besieged the Gaza strip, in response to deadly attacks by the Islamist Militant group Hamas.
Since then, it is estimated that nearly 3,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, and over 1,300 Israelis were killed in Hamas attacks. Hamas is thought to be holding 199 Israeli people hostage.
People have been asked to evacuate their homes in Northern Gaza, but there are few opportunities to cross out of Gaza, and the South is already crowded with provisions running low. A ground invasion of the North by Israeli forces is expected.

US vetoes UN resolution calling for a 'humanitarian pause' on Israel-Hamas conflict,"
THE UNITED STATES vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on today, calling for a “humanitarian pause” in the raging Israel-Hamas conflict.
The country did so as the text did not respect Israel’s right to defend itself, the US ambassador said.
Twelve out of 15 Council members voted in favor of the resolution put forward by Brazil and negotiated over several days, while Russia and the United Kingdom abstained.
The United States was the only vote against, but as one of the body’s five permanent members its vote counts as a veto.
“The United States is disappointed this resolution made no mention of Israel’s rights of self defense,” US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said after the vote.
The resolution said the Council “firmly condemns all violence and hostilities against civilians and all acts of terrorism.”

It said the body “unequivocally rejects and condemns the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas… and the taking of hostages.”
The text also “urges all parties to fully comply with their obligations under international law.”
The vote comes after the Security Council on Monday rejected a Russian resolution condemning spiraling violence in the Middle East.
That resolution did not single out Hamas for its surprise attack on Israel on October 7, and it was rejected by permanent members the United States, the United Kingdom and France, as well as Japan.
The assault on Israel left at least 1,400 people dead and saw Hamas militants take 199 people hostage.

"Number of writers, including Sally Rooney and Anne Enright, sign open letter calling for Gaza ceasefire","A NUMBER OF Irish writers havesigned an open lettercalling for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded admission of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
The letter has been signed by 600 people, including Irish writers Sally Rooney, Anne Enright, Naoise Dolan and Megan Nolan. Artists and writers based in elsewhere in the EU and in the UK and US have also signed the letter.
“The deliberate killing of civilians is always an atrocity. It is a violation of international law and an outrage against the sanctity of human life,” the letter says.
“In Gaza, neither the occupying power, Israel, nor the armed groups of the people under occupation, the Palestinians, can ever be justified in targeting defenceless people. We can only express our grief and heartbreak for the victims of these most recent tragedies, and for their families, both Palestinians and Israelis,” it says.
The letter goes on to say that “nothing can retrieve what has already been lost”, but adds that “the unprecedented and indiscriminate violence that is still escalating against the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza, with the financial and political support of Western powers, can and must be brought to an end”.
“By cutting off vital electricity, food and water supplies; by attempting to displace by force over one million Palestinians from their homes, with no guarantee of return; and by carrying out continual airstrikes against civilians, including those who are attempting to evacuate, the state of Israel is committing grave crimes against humanity,” the letter says.
“Its allies, our own governments, are complicit in these crimes,” it says.

Before hundreds were reported dead following a strike on a hospital in Gaza yesterday, Israeli strikes on Gaza had killed at least 2,778 people, nearly two-thirds of them children, and wounded 9,700 others, according to the Gaza health ministry.
More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, mostly civilians who died in Hamas’s attack on Saturday, 7 October  The assault also resulted in some 200 being taken captive into Gaza.
The open letter continues: “Human rights groups have long condemned Israel’s occupation of Palestine and the inhumane treatment of – and system of racial domination over – Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli state.
“But we are now witnessing a new and even more drastic emergency. The UN expert Francesca Albanese has warned that Israel’s current actions in Gaza constitute a form of ethnic cleansing. The Israeli historian Raz Segal has described the situation in Gaza as a ‘textbook case of genocide’.”
The writers and artists are calling on their governments to “demand an immediate ceasefire and the unimpeded admission of humanitarian aid into Gaza”.
“We also demand an end to all arms shipments and military funding, supplies that can only exacerbate the humanitarian catastrophe at hand. Although these measures will not be enough to secure true justice, liberation and equality for all in the region, they represent an urgent and indispensable first step,” the letter says.
“We plead for an end to all violence, an end to all oppression and denial of human rights, and a path towards a just and sustainable peace for all.”

Biden says hospital blast was apparent result of 'rocket fired by terrorist group in Gaza',"LAST UPDATE|18 Oct 2023
US PRESIDENT JOE Biden has said it appears the explosion at a hospital in Gaza yesterday appears to be a result of a “rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza”.
He arrived in Israel for a diplomatic bid to prevent the war with Hamas from spiralling into an even larger conflict.
The challenge he faces became more difficult as outrage swept through the Middle East over an explosion that killed hundreds in the Gaza Strip hospital.
“I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday. And based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you,” he said as he opened a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.
“But there’s a lot of people out there not sure so we have to overcome a lot of things.”
Speaking at a news conference this afternoon Biden said: “Palestinian people are suffering greatly as well. We mourn the loss of innocent Palestinian lives like the entire world.
“I was outraged and saddened by the enormous loss of life yesterday in Gaza. Based on the information we’ve seen today, that appears a result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza.”
The President said the US “unequivocally stands for the protection of civilian life during conflict and I grieve, I truly grieve, for the families who are killed or wounded by this tragedy”.
Biden was originally scheduled to visit Jordan as well, but his meetings with Arab leaders were called off as he was leaving Washington, costing him an opportunity for the face-to-face conversations he views as crucial.
Now his only stop is Tel Aviv.
Biden told the press conference this afternoon that the US is ”pursuing every avenue to bring home” the hostages being held by Hamas.
The US President also said: “Israel, you are not alone. The United States stands with you.”
Biden said that Israel has “agreed the humanitarian assistance can begin to move from Egypt to Gaza”, adding that the United States was working with partners to get “trucks moving across the border as soon as possible”.
Netanyahu’s office announced this afternoon that Israel would let aid enter Gaza via Egypt, saying only “food, water and medicine” would be allowed into the blockaded Palestinian enclave.

“In light of (US) President (Joe) Biden’s demand, Israel would not foil the supply of humanitarian aid via Egypt,” the prime minister’s office said, announcing a cabinet decision.
The statement noted that aid to civilians in the southern Gaza Strip would be allowed “so long as these supplies do not reach Hamas” which rules Gaza.
During the press conference, Biden cautioned Israelis not to be blinded by rage after suffering their deadliest ever attack, warning that the United States made mistakes after 9/11.
“I caution this while you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice we also made mistakes,” Biden said on a visit to Tel Aviv.
While he visited the country, the US Treasury announced sanctions on 10 members, operatives and financial facilitators of Hamas.
The new sanctions target individuals based in Gaza and elsewhere, including Sudan, Turkey, Algeria and Qatar, the department said in a statement.
Among the individuals are six people associated with a Hamas “secret investment portfolio.”
They include Musa Muhammad Salim Dudin, a member of Hamas’s Political Bureau; as well as Abdelbasit Hamza Elhassan Mohamed Khair, a Sudan-based Hamas financier.
Two “senior Hamas officials,” were targeted: Muhammad Ahmad ‘Abd Al-Dayim Nasrallah based in Qatar and Ayman Nofal, who was allegedly killed in an airstrike on Tuesday, the Treasury said.
The department also took aim at a Gaza-based virtual currency exchange, alongside its operator.
As a result of the sanctions, property of designated individuals in the US must be blocked and reported, alongside other restrictions. Financial institutions engaging in certain transactions with sanctioned entities or individuals could also expose themselves to enforcement action.

Israel has been preparing for a potential ground invasion of Gaza in response to Hamas’s attack on 7 October, which killed 1,400 Israelis.
White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on board Air Force One that Biden “wants to get a sense from the Israelis on the situation on the ground” and will “ask some tough questions”.
“He’ll be asking them as a friend,” Kirby added.
After meeting Netanyahu’s war cabinet in Tel Aviv, Biden said: “We will continue to have your back. As you work to defend your people, we will continue to work with you and partners across the region to prevent more tragedy to innocent civilians.”

The president’s agenda also includes meeting Israeli first responders and the families of victims killed and hostages taken when Hamas made its incursion into Israel.
Hamas has slammed the US for its support for Israel, accusing it of being complicit in the ongoing strikes on Gaza.
“The continued endorsement of the Zionist narrative by the US administration makes it complicit in the occupation’s massacres and the Baptist hospital massacre in Gaza,” the group said in a statement.
Roughly 2,800 Palestinians have been reported killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza. Another 1,200 people are believed to be buried under the rubble, alive or dead, health authorities said.
Those numbers pre-date the explosion at the al-Ahli hospital on Tuesday. No clear cause has been established for the blast.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said an Israeli air strike caused the destruction. The Israeli military denies involvement and blamed a misfired rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group. However, that organisation also rejected responsibility.
Biden said in a statement that he was “outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted”.
He also said he “directed my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened”.

Protests swept through the region after the deaths at the hospital, which had been treating wounded Palestinians and sheltering many more who were seeking a refuge from the fighting.
Hundreds of Palestinians flooded the streets of major West Bank cities including Ramallah. More people joined protests that erupted in Beirut, Lebanon, and Amman, Jordan, where an angry crowd gathered outside the Israeli Embassy.
Outrage over the hospital explosion scuttled Biden’s plans to visit Jordan, where King Abdullah II had planned to host meetings with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. But Abbas withdrew in protest, and the summit was subsequently cancelled outright.
Kirby said Jordan declared three days of mourning after the hospital explosion and that Biden understood the move and was part of a “mutual” decision to call off the Jordan portion of his trip.

EU triple aid to Palestine as leaders struggle to find common ground,"THE EUROPEAN UNION has immediately trebled its humanitarian aid to Palestine after astrike hit the al-Ahli Hospital in Northern Gaza, yesterday evening.
The ministry in Hamas-run the Palestinian territory said at least 500 people had been killed in yesterday’s blast.
Israel and Palestine have traded blame for the strike, which triggered street protests in the Middle East against Israel.
Speaking to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said there is “no excuse for hitting a hospital full of civilians”, but did not apportion any blame for the blast.

The European Commission president announced that the EU would be tripling the amount of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, as she acknowledged that terror from Hamas militants are too affecting the people in the region.
The head EU commissioner said all world leaders needed to redouble their efforts to “protect civilians from the fury of this war”.
She said that the terror in the region warranted a “united response” from the EU and added that “Europe stands with Israel in this dark moment”.
Von der Leyen said terror is “resurfacing”, with the7 October Hamas attacks in Israeland anISIS terrorist killing two people in Brussels this week.
She added that while Israel has the right to defend themselves from Hamas and terror, the citizens in Palestine are also “suffering” from the same terror and that the EU must support them.
Over the last number of days, von der Leyen has faced criticism from a large majority of the Irish MEPs,with many saying she has overstepped her mandate.
Fine Gael MEP Colm Markey issued strong criticism of von der Leyen and said her visit to Israel was “ill-judged”.
Fellow Fine Gael MEPs Maria Walsh and Frances Fitzgerald both said the European Commission is not responsible for setting EU foreign policy.
Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Andrews was unequivocal in his view thatthe projection of the Israeli flag onto the Commission Building last weekwas inappropriate and said Ireland’s stance on Israel-Palestine was “clearly at odds” with President von der Leyen.
Chief commissioner Ursula von der Leyen shared an image of the European Commission building projecting the Israeli flag last week.Ursula von der LeyenUrsula von der Leyen
On Monday, President Michael D Higginscriticised the chief commissionerfor her comments on the Israel-Hamas war, saying that she was “not speaking for Ireland and she wasn’t speaking for the opinions that they hold”.
“It may not have been meant to have malevolent consequences but certainly we need a better performance in relation to European Union diplomacy and practice,” he said.
That prompted European Council President Charles Michel to host a summit of EU leaders by videoconference late yesterday, which emphasised that Israel has the right to defend itself following Hamas’s bloody assault – but only in line with its commitments under international humanitarian law.

Last week, Varadkar saidto mediaandin the Dáilmany times, that it is Ireland’s view that Israel has a right to defend itself but must be proportionate in its response to Hamas’ 7 October attacks.
Von der Leyen told parliamentarians today that while the facts need to be established, “all those responsible must be held accountable” and labelled the blast as a “senseless tragedy”.
President Higgins called for a “reliable” investigation to be carried out, to determine if the attack on the hospital was a war crime.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar made a similar callin the Dáil this afternoon.
Von der Leyen said: “A hospital in Gaza, which was sheltering hundreds of wounded people, was turned into a hell of fire. The scenes from al-Ahli Hospital are horrifying and distressing.”
Michel posted on social media this morning, that there was “no conceivable reason to strike a facility with innocent civilians and medical staff” and said such an attack “is not in line with international law”.
He too called for accountability.
The EU’s top foreign policy official, Josep Borrell, took a sterner view of Israel’s reaction, which has resulted in a siege of Gaza and its 2.3 million Palestinians, who are now cut off from water, food, electricity and humanitarian aid.
“Cutting water supplies and food off from civilian populations isn’t in line with the rules of law,” Borrell told the European Parliament.
“We cannot make the people of Gaza responsible for the terrible actions of Hamas.”
President Higgins is attending theWorld Food Forumthis week and highlighted today that the people in Southern Gaza were “already living in very stressed conditions” due to a lack of food and water rations.
He added that he is outraged by any attack on civilians.
“I express, and have expressed again and again, utter revulsion at the attack of people attending, for example, a music event,” Higgins said.
“But we are not asked to choose and say that we must exclusively concentrate on that particular horror and, at the same time, set aside our concerns at what are the pre-announced, delivered breaches of international law that are involved when you remove water, when you remove medical aid, when you remove food itself from civilian populations.”

He labelled the withholding of rations as a breach of international and humanitarian law and said that any facts that are determined by an investigation must be made available to the public.
The speeches to the parliament, and last night’s videoconference EU summit, highlighted divergences within the EU over the Israel-Hamas conflict.
While there has been widespread condemnation of the slaughter by Hamas of Israelis, disagreements over calls to rein in retaliatory strikes on Gaza continue to boil.

Searches underway at scene of Gaza hospital blast as doctors struggle to treat wounded,"
SEARCHES ARE UNDERWAY at the site of a hospital in Gaza following a strike that health authorities have said killed hundreds sheltering at the facility.
Gazans combed through debris at the al-Ahli Hospital, collecting the bodies of the dead in the battered enclave hours after the blast.
As residents surveyed the damage, Israel and Palestinian militantstraded blame for the strike.
Alongside rows of charred vehicles, volunteers recovered corpses and human limbs that were placed in body bags, while the remains of others were covered in white shrouds and blankets.
“This is a massacre,” Ahmed Tafesh, who assisted in the recovery effort, said, adding that he had collected the eyes, arms, legs and heads of the deceased. “I have never seen anything like this in my life.”
At the nearby Shifa hospital in Gaza City, residents gathered to identify the dead at the hospital’s mortuary and take other bodies for burial.

Yahya Karim, 70, was among those searching for clues about the fate of their relatives.
“I don’t know how many of them died and how many are still alive,” said Karim, admitting that he had planned to shelter in the hospital before the strike.
Outside the Ahli hospital, others who survived the attack who spoke to AFP recounted the terrifying moment when the strike occurred.
“We felt there was fire and things were falling on us. We started looking for each other. The electricity cut suddenly, and we couldn’t see,” said Fatima Saed through tears.
“I don’t know how we came out of it.”

Gaza resident Adnan al-Naqa said that around 2,000 people were taking refuge at the hospital last night at the time of the strike.
“As I entered the hospital, I heard the explosion, I saw a massive fire,” said Naqa.
“The entire square was on fire, there were bodies everywhere, children, women and elderly people.”
Doctors in Gaza City, faced with dwindling medical supplies, are trying to save severely injured victims of the explosion.
Video that the Associated Press confirmed was from the hospital showed the hospital grounds strewn with bodies, many of them young children, as fire engulfed the building. The grass was strewn with blankets, school backpacks and other belongings.

Ambulances and private cars rushed some 350 casualties to Shifa hospital, which was already overwhelmed with wounded from other strikes, said its director, Mohammed Abu Selmia.
Victims arrived with terrible injuries, Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said.
Doctors in the overwhelmed hospital resorted to performing surgery on floors and in corridors, mostly without anaesthesia.
“We need equipment, we need medicine, we need beds, we need anaesthesia, we need everything,” Abu Selmia said.
He warned that fuel for the hospital’s generators would run out within hours, forcing a complete shutdown, unless supplies enter the Gaza Strip.
Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) urged against any attacks on healthcare centres.
“We call … at a minimum to stop any attacks on healthcare facilities,” the head of the WHO’s European branch, Hans Kluge, told AFP in an interview, listing it as a top priority.
“Number two (is) to protect civilians and children, and number three (is) to get humanitarian access from Rafah inside Gaza, because all our supplies are based there already but there is no border opening yet,” he said.
Kluge said the WHO was “very, very worried” about the situation, adding that “the only solution is to stop the fighting”.

He called for “a negotiated peace that ensures the right to health for everyone.”
“Our motto is Health for All, both for the Israeli people, and the Palestinian people.”
In a statement following the attack, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said it was “horrified” by the bombing.
“Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed. This is a massacre. It is absolutely unacceptable,” it said.
“We were operating in the hospital, there was a strong explosion, and the ceiling fell on the operating room. This is a massacre,” Dr Ghassan Abu Sittah, an MSF doctor in Gaza, said.
MSF said that nothing justifies the “shocking attack” on the hospital and its patients and health workers, as well as the people who sought shelter there.
“Hospitals are not a target. This bloodshed must stop. Enough is enough.”
With water and food supplies running low, the United Nations estimates that around one million of Gaza’s 2.4 million residents are currently displaced, with thousands sheltering in hospitals dotted throughout the densely populated enclave.
Meanwhile, Israeli air strikes continued to batter the war-torn enclave, sending residents running for cover early today.
For 12 days, Israel has carried out a withering bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for the killing of 1,400 people who were shot, mutilated or burnt to death in shock cross-border attacks launched by Hamas on 7 October.
Around 3,000 people have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israeli air strikes, according to health officials.
At the Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only connection to Egypt, truckloads of aid have been waiting to enter for more than a day.

"What are Israel, Palestinians and the world saying about the explosion at a Gaza hospital?","THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY has expressed its outrage and sadness at the strike on a hospital in Gaza last night.
The explosion at the al-Ahli Hospital in northern Gaza killed at least 500 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. The blast has sparked protests across the Middle East and wide-ranging condemnation.
The World Health Organization (WHO) was among thoseto condemn the deadly strikeand demanded the immediate protection of civilians and health care in the strip.
“The hospital was operational, with patients, health- and care-givers, and internally-displaced people sheltering there. Early reports indicate hundreds of fatalities and injuries,” the UN health agency said.
Daylight pictures from the scene today have focused on fire damage at a car park at the hospital.
Israel and Palestine have traded blame for the strike.

Israeli authorities said the hospital was hit by a stray rocket fired by the Islamic Jihad militant group.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, after the attack, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: “An analysis of IDF (Israel Defense Forces) operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit.
“Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza,” he said.
At a press conference this morning, the Israeli army said it had “evidence” that militants were responsible for the blast.

“The evidence — which we are sharing with you all — confirms that the explosion at the hospital in Gaza was caused by an Islamic Jihad rocket that misfired,” military spokesman Daniel Hagari told a press conference in Tel Aviv.
“There was no IDF fire by land, sea or air that hit the hospital,” he said, adding that there was damage in the facility’s parking lot
“Our radar system tracked missiles fired by terrorists in Gaza at the time of the explosion and the trajectory analysis of the rockets shows the rockets were fired in close proximity to the hospital.”
The IDF has released satellite imagery of the area around the hospital before and after the blast.
Hagari has also shared a recording of what he claims is a conversation between Hamas operatives discussing the explosion, which was intercepted by Israel.

According toAl Jazeera, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who governs the West Bank and not Hamas-controlled Gaza, has said Israel crossed “all red lines” by targeting the hospital, calling the attack a “hideous war massacre” that cannot be tolerated.
Abbas also withdrew from a previously scheduled meeting with US President Joe Biden.
Speaking to reporters at a United Nations meeting, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian envoy to the UN, called Netanyahu a “liar” and said his digital spokesperson had tweeted that Israel was responsible for the attack, before deleting the post.
Hananya Naftali, amedia spokespersonfor Israel, had tweeted that Israel struck “a Hamas terrorist base inside a hospital in Gaza”.

In a subsequent tweet, Naftali said he had shared a Reuters report about the bombing at the hospital in Gaza “which falsely stated Israel struck the hospital”.
“I mistakenly shared this information in a since deleted post in which I referenced Hamas’ routine use of hospitals to store weapons caches and conduct terrorist activity. I apologize for this error. As the IDF does not bomb hospitals, I assumed Israel was targeting one of the Hamas bases in Gaza,” he said.
Hamas called the strike “a horrific massacre” and pinned the blame on Israel.
Palestinian Islamic Jihad has described as “lies” Israel’s accusations that it was responsible for the strike.
“The Zionist enemy is trying hard to evade its responsibility for the brutal massacre he committed by bombing the Baptist Arab National Hospital in Gaza through his usual fabrication of lies, and through pointing the finger of blame at the Islamic Jihad movement in Palestine,” it said in a statement.
“We therefore affirm that the accusations put forward by the enemy are false and baseless,” it added.
According to the statement, the group claimed the hospital had been ordered to evacuate by Israel under threat of bombardment, and it was a bomb dropped by an Israeli army plane that caused the tragedy.
It said the hospital had “received public notice made global of evacuation under threat of bombing”.
Speaking last night, Daoud Shehab, a spokesman for Islamic Jihad, denied the group was responsible.
He toldReuters: “This is a lie and fabrication, it is completely incorrect. The occupation is trying to cover for the horrifying crime and massacre they committed against civilians.”
Nations in the Middle East which have in recent years established better relations with Israel have blamed it for the blast.
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which both established ties with Israel in the Abraham Accords of 2020, condemned the “Israeli” attack which came as Israel lays siege to Gaza.
“The United Arab Emirates strongly condemns the Israeli attack… resulting in the death and injury of hundreds of people,” the UAE’s official WAM news agency said early today.
Bahrain’s foreign ministry “expressed the Kingdom of Bahrain’s condemnation and strong denunciation of the Israeli bombing”, the Bahrain News Agency said.

Morocco, another country that recognised Israel in 2020, also blamed it for the strike, as did Egypt, which became the first Arab country to normalise relations in 1979.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi condemned in the strongest terms “the Israeli bombing” of the Ahli Arab hospital, which led to “the deaths of hundreds of innocent victims” among the Palestinian citizens in Gaza.
He called the “deliberate bombing” a “clear violation of international law”.
Saudi Arabia, which has ended talks on potential ties with Israel since the conflict flared, called the blast a “heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces”.
Jordan said Israel “bears responsibility for this grave incident” while Qatar, which has close ties to Hamas, slammed the “brutal massacre”.
The Organisation of the Islamic Conference, also blaming Israel, called it “a war crime, a crime against humanity, and organised state terrorism”.
Gulf Cooperation Council secretary general Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi said it was “glaring evidence of the serious violations by the Israeli occupation forces”.
Biden, who has held a meeting with Netanyahu in Israel today,has said that the explosion “appears as though it was done by the other team”, not the Israeli Defence Forces.
The US President was originally scheduled to visit Jordan as well, but his meetings with Arab leaders were called off as he was leaving Washington, costing him an opportunity for the face-to-face conversations he views as crucial.
European leaders have also condemned the attack without apportioning blame.

I am saddened by the strike against the Al-Ahli hospital and the huge death toll.There is no excuse for hitting a hospital full of medical staff and civilians.All the facts have to be established and those responsible must be held accountable.
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she was saddened by the strike and the death toll.
“There is no excuse for hitting a hospital full of medical staff and civilians,” she said. “All the facts have to be established and those responsible must be held accountable.”
French President Emmanuel Macron said: “Nothing can justify striking a hospital. Nothing can justify targeting civilians.
“France condemns the attack on the Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, which made so many Palestinian victims. Our thoughts are with them. All the light must be shed on the circumstances,” he said.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was in Israel when the strike occurred, said he was “horrified” by the images of the explosion.
“Innocent civilians were injured and killed. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims,” he said.
“A thorough investigation of the incident is imperative.”

Occupied Territories Bill in limbo amid calls for unions to back workers refusing to handle Israeli goods,"OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE called for trade unions to support workers who refuse to handle Israeli goods, but moves towards a legislative ban on goods from Israeli-occupied territories appears to have stalled.
The deadly Israel-Hamas conflict has shed fresh light on the Occupied Territories bill, which passed a number of stages in the Oireachtas but has not become law.
Senior government sources have said that while support may be there for the bill to pass, it is the government’s view that now would not be the time to renew it.
It remains the view of the government that the bill would not be compatible with European Union law and would not be implementable.
Government sources have also indicated that, if there was a push for the bill, it would be seen internationally as an attack on Israel while they are dealing with the recent attacks on its civilians by Hamas.
The Bill, which was brought forward by independent senator Frances Black, seeks to prevent Ireland from trading in goods and services imported from Israeli-occupied territories.
Although it does not mention Israel or Palestine specifically, it aims to prohibit “the import and sales of goods, services and natural resources originating in illegal settlements in occupied territories”.
Itpassed in the Seanadin December 2018 despite government opposition, beforepassing second stage in the Dáilin January 2019, when Fianna Fáil and some members of the Independent Alliance abstained from the vote.
Fine Gael repeatedly outlined its opposition to the Bill, with then-Tánaiste Simon Coveney repeatedly saying that he could not support the Bill based on advice from the Attorney General.
Despite the Green Party advocating for the bill in government negotiation talks in 2020, it was ultimately dropped from the Programme for Government.
Following the dissolving of the 32nd Dáil, the bill lapsed, but Black succeeded in having the bill restored to the same stage in December 2020.
The bill is now stalled at Second Stage in the Dáil. In February of this year, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it remains the view of government that trade is an EU competence.
While in September, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said the government has “clear legal advice on this matter. The Government will, therefore, not be taking it forward”.
Leader of the Labour Party Ivana Bacik pointed to the Occupied Territories Bill which has been stalled since 2020 and said it is “now more urgent than ever” that the Government moves to enact it.
“We have all watched closely with great distress the tragic events ongoing in Israel and Palestine following the horrific and brutal attacks by Hamas upon Israeli civilians, which I condemned when they were carried out,” she said.

Bacik said the Irish people, and the Labour Party, have shown strong support for Palestine and said:
“We want to see that level of support reflected in Irish Government policies. It has been well over a year and a half since the Dáil voted to condemn the de facto annexation of Palestinian land by the Israeli state.
“The Occupied Territories Bill has passed through both Houses but despite receiving support from Fianna Fáil and the Greens, it has yet to be enacted by Government.”
She added: “the time for Government to act is now”.
With the government not progressing with the proposed legislation, opposition members believe it falls to workers to take the initiative now.
Trade unions
People Before Profit Mick Barry yesterday urged trade unions to support workers who refuse to handle Israeli goods in protest over the Israeli government’s response to last week’s attack by Hamas.
Barry expressed his frustration that the Irish Government has not enacted the Occupied Territories Bill and said it’s “shameful” that the Government won’t act on this but that he “hopes workers will”.
Speaking to reporters outside Leinster House, Barry drew a comparison between the Israeli state’s treatment of Palestinians and the apartheid state of South Africa.
He pointed to the action taken by Dunnes Stores workers in Henry Street in Dublin in 1984 when they refused to handle South African produce.
Barry said: “After three years of striking, Government here implemented a ban on some apartheid produce in the state.
“So I want to say today that I think that any worker…who has the courage to refuse to handle Israeli goods, they deserve the full backing, the full support and solidarity of the Irish trade union movement.”
“The need to speak up against the injustices that are taking place,” he added.
Bacik toldThe Journalthat the Labour Party also fully supports any workers in their opposition to handling any Israeli goods.
“There is power in these actions,” she said.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has reiterated his support for a two-state solution, and the opinion of the former Attorney General that the Occupied Territories Bill is contrary to EU law and at risk of constitutional challenge.

At least 500 feared dead after strike on Gaza City hospital,"LAST UPDATE|17 Oct 2023
THE GAZAN HEALTH Ministry has said at least 500 people have been killed in a hospital explosion it claims was caused by an Israeli air strike.
However, the Israel Defense Forces said this evening that they believe the Islamic Jihad militant group is responsible for the hospital attack.
Photos from the al-Ahli Hospital in Northern Gaza showed fire engulfing the hospital halls, shattered glass and bodies scattered across the area.
The ministry in Hamas-run the Palestinian territory said at least 500 people had been killed. If confirmed, the attack would be by far the deadliest Israeli air strike in five wars fought since 2008.
The ministry claimed  “two hundred to 300″ people were killed in strikes on the yard of the Ahli Arab hospital in central Gaza. Shortly after, the ministry said the death toll was at least 500. “Hundreds of victims are still under the rubble,” it added.
Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari earlier said there were still no details on the hospital deaths, adding: “We will get the details and update the public. I don’t know to say whether it was an Israeli air strike.”
The Israel Defense Forces said this evening that they believe the Islamic Jihad militant group is responsible for the hospital attack.
“An analysis of IDF (army) operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to Ahli hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit,” the military said in a statement.
“Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza,” the statement said, referring to another Gaza-based militant group which has claimed to be fighting Israel alongside Hamas.
The Head of Palestinian Mission to the UK, Husam Zomlot, labelled the strike a “massacre”.
“Hundreds are killed in an Israeli strike on the Episcopal (Anglican) Church hospital (Al Ahli Arab Hospital) in [Gaza], there were hundreds of medical staff, patients and civilians taking refuge under Church protection,”Zomlot said on X, formerly Twitter, this evening.
Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, has declared three days of mourning for victims, according tolocal media reports. Abbas also ordered that flags be flown at half-mast.
Several hospitals in Gaza City have become refuges for hundreds of people, hoping they would be spared bombardment after Israel ordered all residents of the city and surrounding areas to evacuate to the southern Gaza Strip.
In the south, continued strikes killed dozens of civilians and at least one senior Hamas figure in attacks it says are targeted at militants. The media office of Gaza’s Hamas government described the attack as a “war crime”.
“The hospital was housing hundreds of sick and wounded, and people forcibly displaced from their homes” because of other strikes, a statement said.
Speaking to RTÉ this evening, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed he had heard what he described as “very worrying reports” of a strike on a hospital in Gaza.
“We don’t have the full information yet but, it emphasises – very much – our view that civilian infrastructure should not be targeted,” the Taoiseach said.

“There is evidence that Hamas uses civilian infrastructure as a cover for its operations but that doesn’t justify operations that may cause the deaths of hundreds of civilians,” he added.
Last week, Varadkar saidto mediaandin the Dáilmany times, that it is Ireland’s view that Israel has a right to defend itself but must be proportionate in its response to Hamas’ 7 October attacks.
The foreign ministry of Egypt said it condemns “in the strongest terms” the bombing of the Gazan hospital this evening.
Speaking on behalf of the World Health Organisation (WHO), its chiefDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X it”strongly condemns” the attack on the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza.
“Early reports indicate hundreds of deaths and injuries,” Dr Tedros said. “We call for the immediate protection of civilians and health care, and for the evacuation orders to be reversed.”
In a separate statement on X this evening, the WHOsaid it “strongly condemns the attack on Al Ahli Arab Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip”.
“The hospital was one of 20 in the north of the Gaza Strip facing evacuation orders from the Israeli military,” it said on X.

“The order for evacuation has been impossible to carry out given the current insecurity, critical condition of many patients, and lack of ambulances, staff, health system bed capacity, and alternative shelter for those displaced.
“International humanitarian law must be abided by, which means health care must be actively protected and never targeted,” it added.
ActionAid Ireland has also condemned “in the strongest terms” the bombing of Gaza’s Al Ahli Al Arabi Al Ma’amadani Hospital.
The international aid charity described it as an “egregious violation of international humanitarian law”.
ActionAid Ireland CEO, Karol Balfe, said tonight: “Hospitals in Gaza are seen as a place of safety and refuge for many civilians seeking shelter during continuous bombardment.
“It is imperative that the international community unites to hold those responsible accountable,” she added.
Posting on X shortly after the strike, Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said the “only thing” that should enter Gaza “are hundreds of tons of explosives from the Air Force, not an ounce of humanitarian aid”.
Ben-Gvir suggested that the bombardment of Gaza would come to an end, and humanitarian aid would be provided, if Hamas hand back their Israeli hostages.
“As long as Hamas does not release the hostages in its hands – the only thing that needs to enter Gaza are hundreds of tons of explosives from the Air Force, not an ounce of humanitarian aid,”he said on X.
The strike has yet to be confirmed by the Israeli Defence Forces, a spokesperson said the force would “look into” the matter.

I am sure that this will also be the message that the president of the United States will convey,” he added.17 Oct 202311:51AMA British teenager who went missing after Hamas’s attack on southern Israel was murdered, her family have told BBC News.British teenager, 13, who was missing with her 16-year-old sister after Hamas attack, has been murdered, family sayhttps://t.co/nHIeRC2HsO— BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking)October 17, 2023Yahel (13) disappeared after militants attacked Kibbutz Be’eri and killed her British-born mother Lianne.Family members have now confirmed that Yahel was also killed. Her sister Noiya (16) and Israeli father Eli are still missing.Ina statement to BBC News, they said: “Beautiful Yahel. A bundle of unbridled energy and joy, with a cheekiness that you could not help but smile at and a brain which was sharp as a tack.“Full of adventure and mischief, we will forever miss her, but are grateful for the light she brought into our lives in the too short time she was with us.”17 Oct 202312:31PMSpeaking outside Leinster House in the last hour, People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett accused Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza.He also called on Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, to resign over her response to the war.Boyd Barrett is the latest in a line of politiciansto criticisevon der Leyen’s public support for Israel.Press LIVE: Stop Gaza Genocide | Cap Mortgage Interest rate | Health Budgethttps://t.co/2BbtRZUAEB— People Before Profit (@pb4p)October 17, 2023“Ursula von der Leyen should resign. She has publicly given unconditional support to the State of Israel at exactly the same time that it has publicly declared its intention to commit war crimes.“The ethnic cleansing of a million Palestinians is, under international law, a war crime. To transfer populations when you’re occupying people, is a war crime. So, in fact, what Israel is perpetrating now is a second Nakba,” Boyd Barrett said.The Nakba refers to the destruction of the Palestinian homeland in 1948, an event that resulted in the displacement of around 700,000 Palestinians and the deaths of some 15,000 people.17 Oct 202312:36PMBoyd Barrett said the Irish government should immediately call for Israel’s referral to the International Criminal Court for war crimes, but noted that Israel is not one of the court’s 123 member states.He also called on the government to expel the Israeli ambassador “as part of imposing sanctions on Israel”.17 Oct 202312:55PMThe US military has put 2,000 troops on deployment alert, the Pentagon said today, in response to the escalating conflict.US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin placed the personnel and a range of units “on a heightened state of readiness through a prepare-to-deploy order”, the Pentagon said in a statement, to be able “to respond quickly to the evolving security environment in the Middle East”.17 Oct 202312:58PMWhen asked what the Irish Labour Party has made of the UK Labour Party’s response to the Israel-Hamas war, TD Duncan Smith told reporters: “We don’t take our lead from the British Labour Party.”When asked what the Irish Labour Party has made of the UK Labour Party’s response to the Israel-Hamas war, Duncan Smith said he hasn’t been “100% across what Keir Starmer has said in the last couple of days”.He added: “We don’t take our lead from the British Labour Party”.pic.twitter.com/voGbQeYK0X— Jane Matthews (@janeematthews)October 17, 202317 Oct 20231:00PMIsrael has bombed areas of southern Gaza where it told Palestinians to flee ahead of an expected invasion, killing dozens of people, PA News reports.Violence along Israel’s border with Lebanon has also led to concerns over a widening regional conflict that diplomats have been working to prevent.In Gaza, people wounded in the air strikes were rushed to hospital after heavy attacks outside the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, residents reported.Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official and former health minister, said 27 people were killed in Rafah and 30 in Khan Younis.An Associated Press reporter saw around 50 bodies brought to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Family members came to claim the bodies, wrapped in white bed sheets, some soaked in blood.An air strike in Deir al Balah reduced a house to rubble, killing nine members of the family living there.Three members of another family that had evacuated from Gaza City were killed in a neighbouring home. The dead included one man and 11 women and children. Witnesses said there was no warning before the strike.The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas hideouts, infrastructure and command centres.“When we see a target, when we see something moving that is Hamas, we’ll take care of it. We’ll handle it,” Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, said.17 Oct 20231:15PMUN warns Israel against 'forcible transfer' of GazansThe United Nations has warned Israel against the “forcible transfer of civilians” in the Gaza Strip, which could be in breach of international law.The UN human rights office said that a legal temporary evacuation of civilians came with obligations on Israel, which, it said, Israel appears to have made no attempt to fulfil.“We have grave fears about the toll on civilians in the coming days. Military operations show no signs of abating,” UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a media briefing.“International law requires that any lawful temporary evacuation by Israel, as the occupying power, of an area on the basis of the security of the population or imperative military reasons must be accompanied by the provision of proper accommodation for all evacuees, undertaken under satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition,” she said.“There appears to have been no attempt by Israel to ensure this for the 1.1 million civilians ordered to move.“We are concerned that this order combined with the imposition of a ‘complete siege’ on Gaza may not be considered as lawful temporary evacuation and would therefore amount to a forcible transfer of civilians –in breach of international law.”17 Oct 20231:32PMUS troopsWe have some more details now on the US’ move to put 2,000 troops on deployment alert.US media has reported that if the troops were deployed to the Middle East, they would cover support roles, such as medical assistance and handling explosives.However, “no decisions have been made to deploy any forces at this time”, the Pentagon said in a statement.The US has already deployed two aircraft carriers to the region “to deter hostile actions against Israel”.17 Oct 20231:41PMIf you’ve been following us since this morning, you’ll remember the comments made today by Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the conflict.(In case not, here’s a recap: he said that “if the crimes of the Zionist regime continue, Muslims and resistance forces will become impatient, and no one can stop them”.)However, a senior White House official has said the US has not seen any signs of a deepening engagement by Iran in the Israel-Hamas war.Asked whether US authorities have noticed that Iran was engaging in the conflict in new ways, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on CNN, “Outside of the rhetoric…, no we haven’t.”17 Oct 20232:00PMSeveral MEPs, including Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews, have signed an open letter calling for the resignation of Olivér Várhelyi, European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement.“On October 9th, Olivér Várhelyi suddenly announced on X the immediate suspension of the disbursement of the European development funds dedicated to Palestine, in reaction to the horrific attacks of Hamas on Israeli civilians on October 7th,” an open letter to the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, states.“Commissioner Várhelyi had no authority to unilaterally decide this, nor to officially communicate this on his social media accounts without this decision being taken with due process,” the letter argues.Read the full letter here.Olivér VárhelyiAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo17 Oct 20232:15PMBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told his Cabinet that Hamas was responsible for the “murder and suspected abduction of British nationals”, Downing Street has said.Asked if it is believed that some of the ten missing British citizens may have been kidnapped, Sunak’s official spokesman said: “It’s a dynamic situation.“I think sadly the full details of this attack are still becoming clear.”Downing Street has also urged Israel to allow water into Gaza, while refusing to say whether it believes the tactic to shut off the supply was in line with international law.“We continue to urge Israel as a democracy we work closely with to act within international law in their actions, I think they are taking steps to do that,” the official spokesman said.“We are in discussions and are keen to see water restored to the area.“We want to do everything possible to relieve the unfolding humanitarian issues in Gaza. Water is an important part of that.”17 Oct 20232:36PMOireachtas TVOireachtas TVTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that he told European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen that he thought some of her statements “lacked balance”.Speaking during Leaders’ Questions this afternoon, he said: “I’ve said that to her and I have no difficulty saying that.“I do think statements that she’s made more recently were more balanced, specifically talking about the tripling of EU humanitarian aid for Gaza and also the attempts that we’re making at the moment to organise a UN Humanitarian Air Bridge from Gaza through Egypt,” he said.Soc Dems leader Holly Cairns says von der Leyen stood with the Israeli prime minister and offered him the EU's unqualified and unconditional support.She says Varadkar needs to make it clear that von der Leyen does not speak for Ireland. She pleads with him to use his voice.— Christina Finn (@christinafinn8)October 17, 2023He was responding to Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns, who said von der Leyen’s failure to “unequivocally condemn Israel’s collective punishment of the Palestinian people has undermined the EU’s response to this crisis”.“Given von der Leyen has no authority to override member states’ foreign policy positions, her comments also amounted to a serious overreach of her authority,” she said.It comes after People Before Profitcalled on the European Commission president to resignover her actions in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.17 Oct 20232:55PMKeren Schem with a photo of her daughter Mia Schem.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock PhotoThe mother of a French-Israeli woman who was taken hostage by Hamas, and was shown in a video clip released by the militant group, has appealed for her immediate release.Yesterday, Hamas’s military wing released a video showing a dazed Mia Schem (21) with her arm covered in bandages.It was the first sign of life from any of the hostages since Gaza-based gunmen smashed through border fortifications on 7 October and killed more than 1,400 people in Israel.“I didn’t know if she’s dead or alive until yesterday,” her mother, Keren Schem, said at a news conference.You can read the full story here.17 Oct 20233:19PMAyman Nofal pictured in 2011.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock PhotoAFP is reporting that Hamas has said that one of the top leaders of its armed wing has been killed in an Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip today.“Ayman Nofal, ‘Abu Ahmad’, a member of the general military council and commander of the central command in Al-Qassam Brigades, was killed” in an Israeli strike on the central Gaza Strip, Hamas said in a statement, referring to its military wing.The Israeli military did not immediately confirm the killing when contacted by AFP.17 Oct 20233:27PMGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said that his visit to Israel today is “a visit to friends”.In a statement shared in Hebrew on X, formerly Twitter, Scholz confirmed that he would also be travelling to Egypt to meet with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.“The issue is the protection of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip and prevention of conflagration in the area,” he said.הביקור שלי בישראל הוא ביקור אצל חברים. גרמניה עומדת איתן לצדה של ישראל.לאחר מכן אטוס למצרים לפגוש את הנשיא א-סיסי. הנושא הוא ההגנה על האוכלוסייה האזרחית ברצועת עזה ומניעת התלקחות באזור.— Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (@Bundeskanzler)October 17, 202317 Oct 20233:40PMTánaiste Micheál Martin.Oireachtas TVOireachtas TVTánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Micheál Martin has said that the decision by the Israeli military to tell the entire civilian population in the north of the Gaza Strip to move southward for their own safety “was unrealistic, unworkable and deeply dangerous”.In his opening remarks to the Oireachtas Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs and Defence this afternoon, he said the rules of war exist “to help preserve humanity in its darkest moments, and they desperately need to be followed today”.“They are, and should remain, our compass to ensure that we put humanity first. The rules are clear and they apply to all sides, in all conflicts, everywhere; to state and non-state armed groups alike.”Martin said we are now seeing the “terrible humanitarian consequences” of Israel’s decision to tell civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate.He said there is an “urgent need” for humanitarian corridors to be established to deliver assistance to Palestinian civilians and said the Government is in ongoing contact with the United Nations, International Committee of the Red Cross and regional partners on this issue.He also said that voices of moderation “have been drowned out for far, far too long”.“That does not mean that Israel should abandon its right to self-defence. No one, of any political background, can be in any doubt now as to who Hamas are, what they are capable of, and what their objectives are. Nothing justifies what we witnessed on 7 October,” he continued.None of that means though that we should abandon rationality and reason in our response. And as outside observers, who care deeply about this situation, the only responsible way forward is to support a future in which people do not utilise political violence to achieve their aims.“This is the foundation upon which peace is built. We can argue over the best ways in which we can achieve this, but we should be clear that this is our aim.”17 Oct 20233:59PMThe Palestinian health ministry has said that around 3,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since 7 October.In an update, the ministry said that over 12,500 people have been injured.It said that 61 people have been killed in the West Bank, with over 1,250 injured.17 Oct 20234:30PMPalestinian militant group Hamas has said one of the top leaders of its armed wing was killed during an Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip.“Ayman Nofal, ‘Abu Ahmad’, a member of the general military council and commander of the central command in Al-Qassam Brigades, was killed” in an Israeli strike on the central Gaza Strip, Hamas said in a statement, referring to its military wing.Confirming his killing, the Israeli military described Nofal as “one of the most dominant figures” in Hamas.An army statement described Nofal as the group’s former head of military intelligence, who has been involved in manufacturing weapons and directing rockets fired at Israel.Nofal was also “involved in planning the abduction of Gilad Shalit”, a soldier released in 2011 after being held for more than five years, the army said.Earlier today, the military said it had killed another top Hamas militant — Osama Mazini — an announcement which the group is yet to comment on.Israel had earlier announced the deaths of other Hamas commanders or officials since its bombing of Gaza targets began.Hamas separately reported Israeli forces targeted a Gaza City home belonging to the family of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, who is based in Qatar.The property belongs to Haniyeh’s brother, a Gaza security source told AFP.17 Oct 20234:56PMJohn KirbyAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock PhotoMore on the news of the US’ move to put 2,000 troops on deployment alert.US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said preparing the troops for deployment “is really about sending a signal of deterrence”.“We don’t want to see this conflict escalate and widen,” Kirby said on CNN.“There are no plans or intentions to put US boots on the ground in combat in Israel.”17 Oct 20234:58PMGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) takes part in a press meeting after the talks alongside Benjamin Netanyahu (r), Prime Minister of IsraelAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock PhotoPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for broad international support in the country’s war against Gaza rulers Hamas after the militant group’s deadly attack on Israel.“The world must stand united behind Israel to defeat Hamas,” Netanyahu said alongside visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.The German leader is one of a slew of top politicians to have visited Israel since Hamas militants from Gaza attacked the country on 7 October.“The savagery that we witnessed perpetrated by the Hamas murderers coming out of Gaza were the worst crimes committed against Jews since the Holocaust,” Netanyahu said, referring to the extermination of more than six million Jews by the Nazis.17 Oct 20235:37PMUnesco, the UN’s cultural agency,has saidthe Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October has led to intense fighting and the “deadliest week for journalists in any recent conflict”.It said it has confirmed the deaths of nine journalists in the line of duty since 7 October in Gaza and on the Israeli-Lebanese border, warning the toll could rise further.“This is a dramatic toll.

Israeli air strikes continued to pound Gaza early this morning, even inside an evacuation zone where Israel had told residents to gather in advance of an expected ground offensive.
Israel appears set to mount a major assault on the northern part of the territory aimed at rooting out Hamas.
The Israeli strikes have killed at least 2,778 people and wounded 9,700 others in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry there.
The strikes have not stopped Hamas militants from continuing to attack Israel with rockets launched from Gaza.
At the Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only connection to Egypt, truckloads of aid are waiting to go into the densely populated territory, while trapped civilians are hoping desperately to get out.
More than one million Palestinians have fled their homes and 60% are now in the approximately eight-mile area south of the evacuation zone, according to the UN.
Aid workers have warned that the territory is near complete collapse, with ever-decreasing supplies of water and medicine and with power running out at hospitals.
Mediators are trying to reach a ceasefire to open the border, which was shut down last week after Israeli air strikes.
An agreement appeared to have been reached on yesterday but Israel denies reports of a ceasefire in Rafah, which would be needed to open the gates. As of this morning, they are still closed.
It is believed there are around 40 Irish citizens in Gaza in need of evacuation.

The US has announced plans for President Biden to travel to Israel and Jordan tomorrow.
In the latter country, he’ll be discussing humanitarian aid with Arab leaders after meeting with officials in Israel.
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby announced Biden would go to Jordan to meet King Abdullah, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
“We’ve been crystal clear about the need for humanitarian aid to be able to continue to flow into Gaza,” Kirby said.
“That has been a consistent call by President Biden and certainly by this entire administration.”

Israeli troops have killed four militants attempting to infiltrate from Lebanon, according to the Israeli army.
“Observation troops spotted a terrorist squad attempting to infiltrate the security fence with Lebanon and plant an explosive device,” the army said in a statement.
Earlier, the military said it had targeted Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah group with overnight air strikes on southern Lebanon.
Since 7 October, clashes on the Israel-Lebanon border have left more than 10 people dead on the Lebanese side.
Most of the dead have been combatants, but they also include a Reuters journalist and two civilians.

The Explainer: What would an Israeli ground offensive look like?,"AS THE LATEST conflict in the Middle East carries on between Israel and militant-group Hamas, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) look to be gearing up for a ground offensive in The Gaza Strip.
Last week, Israeli officials called for the immediate evacuation of 1.1 million people – a tasked that was deemed “impossible” by many international agencies and even an IDF spokesperson.
The death toll from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip has risen to around 2,750 since Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel last week, the Gaza health ministry said.
Some 9,700 people have also been injured as Israel continued its air campaign on targets in the Palestinian coastal enclave, the Hamas-controlled ministry added.

Over the border, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said the Israeli death toll is more than 1,400.
Regardless of what happens next those figures will increase further: unarmed non-combatant civilians will be killed as the IDF begins its mission to fight Hamas inside Gaza.
But it will be an operation not without its challenges for Israeli soldiers and will see plenty of those troops killed also.

As It Happened: Hamas says threat of Israeli ground invasion of Gaza Strip 'doesn't scare us',"LAST UPDATE|16 Oct 2023
THE LETHAL AERIAL bombardment of Gaza by the Israeli military is continuing ahead of an expected ground invasion.
More than one million people have fled their homes following an Israeli order to move to the south of the tiny Mediterranean enclave.
It’s estimated that at least 2,750 people, mainly civilians, have been killed by the Israeli air assault which was unleashed after the Hamas attack on civilians in south Israel that killed more than 1,400 people.
There have been calls from humanitarian groups and some nations for the opening of a border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to allow aid into the besieged strip.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said today that the EU will launch a humanitarian air corridor to Gaza through Egypt with the first flights expected this week.
A spokesperson for Hamas’s military wing this evening said the threat of an Israeli ground invasion of the blockaded Gaza Strip “doesn’t scare us and we are ready for it”.
Here are the latest developments as they happened today:
16 Oct 20238:48AMGood morning.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office Monday denied reports of a ceasefire in Gaza that would enable aid to enter and foreigners to flee to Egypt, 10 days into the war with Hamas.“There is currently no ceasefire and humanitarian aid in Gaza in return for removing foreigners,” a statement from Netanyahu’s office said.Succinct message from the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office this morning:pic.twitter.com/UCkQiJ3pVk— Alistair Bunkall (@AliBunkallSKY)October 16, 202316 Oct 20238:50AMIt’s been confirmed that around 40 Irish citizens are in the besieged Gaza Strip awaiting help to evacuate.As humanitarian workers call for urgent corridors to be established to allow supplies to flow in and residents to flee, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with French President Emmanuel Macron last night to discuss the two countries’ approach to evacuating citizens.Speaking to RTÉ News, Varadkar said that he and Macron discussed the need for humanitarian corridors as Israel continues to strike Gaza and essential supplies such as food, water, electricity and medicines run short.“We also talked about our various citizens who are in Gaza and how we might assist each other in evacuating them if needs be,” the Taoiseach said.I think it’s fair to say that we have a shared view on the situation and how it might develop. We’re both very concerned about escalation and the situation getting worse and maybe spreading to the West Bank or Lebanon.16 Oct 20239:00AMAssociated Press / Alamy Stock PhotoAssociated Press / Alamy Stock Photo / Alamy Stock PhotoThe United States’ top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, has been travelling all around the region as part of efforts to keep the conflict contained with Israel and Palestine.Blinken held talks in  six Arab states over the last four days but today returns to Tel Aviv in Israel.“I want an opportunity to share everything that I’ve heard — that I’ve learned — over the last few days visiting with our other partners and to talk about the way forward with our Israeli allies and friends,” Blinken told reporters yesterday in Cairo.I made clear that it cannot be — must not be — business as usual with Hamas going forward. And at the same time, as I said, we’re determined to do everything we can to address the needs of people in Gaza.“Civilians should not have to suffer for Hamas’s atrocities.”The Biden administration has said that Israel has a right to respond and has stopped short of calling for restraint or a ceasefire.16 Oct 20239:16AMBlinken’s meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi had a huge bocus on Gaza’s border cross with Egypt.Media reports had said Israel, Egypt and the United States had agreed the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt would be opened for several hours today in a one-off move to allow foreign nationals to flee and aid goods to enter.How this was refuted by Netanyahu’s statement earlier.Aid convoys have waited on the Egyptian side but, according to witnesses, had not left the town of El-Arish, about 40 km east of Rafah.16 Oct 20239:37AMThe Israeli military has raised the figure to 199 people confirmed to have been abducted by Hamas to the Gaza Strip in the militants’ cross-border attacks which sparked a devastating war.“We have updated the families of 199 hostages,” military spokesman Daniel Hagari told a media briefing, revising up an earlier number of 155 captives.16 Oct 202310:02AMGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz will travel to Israel tomorrow to show solidarity in the wake of the deadly attack by Hamas militants on October 7, German media has reported.It would be the first visit by a foreign head of state to Israel since the assault.Scholz has pledged full support for Israel, saying last week that Germany’s “only place” right now “is at Israel’s side”.16 Oct 202310:16AMIt’s Órla Ryan here, taking over the liveblog from Rónán Duffy.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to Israel today after talks in six Arab states, hoping to coordinate efforts against Hamas while finding ways to alleviate Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.Just four days after he paid a visit to Tel Aviv to show solidarity, Blinken landed back in the city and is expected to meet leaders in Jerusalem as Israel prepares a major ground operation in the Gaza Strip.“I want an opportunity to share everything that I’ve heard — that I’ve learned — over the last few days visiting with our other partners and to talk about the way forward with our Israeli allies and friends,” Blinken told reporters yesterday in Cairo.US officials say Blinken heard wide opposition to Hamas from leaders during his tour — but also concern on the plight of the Palestinians.“I made clear that it cannot be — must not be — business as usual with Hamas going forward,” Blinken said in Cairo.“And at the same time, as I said, we’re determined to do everything we can to address the needs of people in Gaza,” he said.“Civilians should not have to suffer for Hamas’s atrocities.”16 Oct 202310:20AMUnder US pressure, Israel yesterday resumed the supply of water to the southern Gaza Strip after earlier vowing to keep out all supplies of food, water and energy to the densely-populated territory.The United States also named a coordinator to spearhead humanitarian relief into Gaza, retired ambassador David Satterfield, who is expected to arrive in Israel today.The Biden administration has said that Israel has a right to respond and has stopped short of calling for restraint or a ceasefire.But it has also warned against more extreme measures such as mass expulsion of Palestinians, a prospect feared by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, a Hamas rival based in the West Bank.Biden, in an interview broadcast on the CBS News show 60 Minutes yesterday, cautioned of dangers in any bid by Israel to reoccupy Gaza.“I think it would be a mistake,” the US president said.Biden is apparently considering an invitation to visit Israel, AFP reports.Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. Shortly thereafter, Israel imposed an air, land and sea blockade of the territory that was intensified after it came under the control of Hamas, considered a terrorist group by Israel and the United States.Blinken held talks in four of the five Arab states with diplomatic relations with Israel — Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.He also visited Saudi Arabia, which put its own normalisation bid with Israel on hold after the violence, and Qatar, a US partner that maintains relations with Hamas.16 Oct 202310:41AMA Palestinian woman reacts next to people wounded in an Israeli airstrike, at al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza StripAP / PA ImagesAP / PA Images / PA ImagesMore than a million people have fled their homes in the besieged Gaza Strip in the past week, ahead of an expected Israeli invasion that seeks to eliminate Hamas’ leadership after its deadly attack.The enclave’s food and water supplies are dwindling, with its hospitals warning that they are on the verge of collapse.Israeli forces, supported by a growing deployment of US warships in the region and the call-up of some 360,000 reservists, have positioned themselves along Gaza’s border and prepared for what Israel said would be a broad campaign to dismantle the militant group.16 Oct 202310:54AMBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will address MPs later today about the escalating crisis in Israel and Gaza, as politicians return to Westminster, PA News reports.Palestinians in Gaza remain braced for an imminent Israeli invasion, a week after Hamas militants launched a deadly assault on the country.Sunak earlier reiterated his government’s support for the Jewish community, after a weekend that saw growing international efforts to stop the conflict escalating further.16 Oct 202310:59AMThe Arab League chief has called for an immediate end to military operations in the Gaza Strip and for aid to be allowed into to the impoverished Palestinian enclave.“We demand the immediate end of military operations and the opening of safe corridors to bring aid to the population,” Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said during a meeting with Arab justice ministers in Baghdad today.16 Oct 202311:09AMEleven Palestinian journalists have been killed in the war in Gaza since Israel launched its blistering air campaign on the coastal enclave, the Palestinian journalists’ union said today.Twenty other journalists have also been injured in the conflict since it erupted on 7 October.16 Oct 202311:36AMScores of foreigners have been killed, wounded or taken hostage after Hamas attacked Israel last week, leaving more than 1,400 people dead in Israel.Gaza Strip health authorities have reported that more than 2,750 people have been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes.According to an AFP count, more than 160 foreigners have been confirmed dead by their national authorities, many of whom also held Israeli nationality.Some 199 people have been confirmed to have been abducted, the Israeli military said today.Here is what we know so far:United States: 30 dead, others abducted, missingAt least 30 US citizens have been killed since the Hamas attack last week, a State Department spokesperson said on Sunday.

mandates.Both have expressed support to Israel since the war broke out.MacManus claimed that the actions of both are a reminder of why it was crucial that consensus is retained on foreign, security and defence policy.“The actions of Von der Leyen and Metsola were contrary to the European Union’s stated aims and values, including contributing to peace and security, the protection of human rights and the strict observance of international law.“The failure to call for restraint or to call for Israel to abide by international law was completely unacceptable,” the Midlands–North-West MEP said.“For Ireland to play a positive role in the wider world and in peace building it is also important that we do not cede the sovereignty that enables us to pursue an independent foreign policy,” he added.“The actions of Von der Leyen and Metsola will have done untold damage to the European Union and undermine its credibility and the potential to play a role in achieving peace.“The European Union should be playing a leading role in an international intervention to bring about a ceasefire by all sides.”16 Oct 20233:18PMStaying with Irish reaction, Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik has contacted Von Der Leyen to request that the EU seek a commitment from Israel that they will stop attacks upon the civilian population of Gaza.She said it is important that political leaders “maintain pressure on the EU Commission” to ensure a coherent response to the “ongoing breaches of international law by Israel” following its reprisals against Gaza.Macik has also asked Von Der Leyen to press Israel to “refrain from any further breaches of international humanitarian law” in the conflict.Bacik added that Israel should be pressured to not commence a ground invasion of Gaza and avert an “appalling humanitarian catastrophe” in the region.16 Oct 20233:25PMRocket alert sirens have blared in Jerusalem while several blasts were heard in the city, interrupting a sitting of parliament.AFP

We’ve been anxious to work through the authorities there and we’re going to continue to do that,” the Tánaiste and foreign affairs minister said.“We have been working with the families concerned and with the citizens.”Martin said diplomatic efforts are being made to prevent the spread of tensions to Lebanon and “deescalate the situation”.He called on the protection of civilians to be prioritised and for a distinction to be drawn between Palestinians and Hamas militants.Speaking from Galway, he said he has always been concerned about bombs being dropped on built-up areas, saying there is “no doubt” innocent people are killed when an area like Gaza is targeted.He added: “We have been fairly careful in terms of our public commentary on this because this is a fraught situation.“So we would prefer to work with the authorities on the ground to see can we do everything we can to support our citizens, but it’s clearly challenging because of the nature of what’s going on there.”16 Oct 20233:39PMHello, Hayley Halpin here now.

French footballer sorry for 'nervous laugh' during minute's silence,"LAST UPDATE|16 Oct 2023

FRANCE INTERNATIONAL JEAN-CLAIR Todibo on Monday apologised for laughing during a minute’s silence in memory of the victims of the Israel-Hamas conflict and a murdered French teacher before a Euro 2024 qualifier last week.
“I had a nervous laugh in relation to this minute of silence but in no case did I make fun of the current situation,” the 23-year-old Nice defender told journalists.
Cameras caught Todibo laughing during the tribute, which took before France’s 2-1 win over the Netherlands in Amsterdam on Friday, to the victims of the conflict between Hamas and Israel.
The minute’s silence also remembered a teacher killed last week in the northern French city of Arras in what the government called an Islamist terror attack.

Todibo, who is in the France team for Tuesday’s friendly match against Scotland in Lille, said he had never intended to offend.
“I wanted to express myself today in relation to the extent of the situation and the interpretation of the situation which is quite crazy,” he said before France’s press conference in Lille.
“The context was unusual, we were among rival fans who had made certain jokes and I had this nervous laugh that came out.
“I wanted to apologise to all the people who I could have offended, that’s the least I can do. Let there be no mistake about that.”
“I’m hurt because it taints the education that my mother gave me,” he continued.
“Some said that I laughed during this minute of silence because I was making fun of the death of a teacher, you should know that my mother has worked in National Education for 20 years and I have enormous respect for these people.

“This could have happened to my mother. It bothers me because it reflects an image which is not mine.
“I think I’m a boy with a very good education and with respect for people.”
Before Todibo’s apology, the national ethics council of the French Football Federation had sent a letter to the player to ask him to explain himself, reserving the right to refer the matter to the FFF disciplinary committee.

"President says Israel reducing humanitarian law ‘to tatters’, criticises EU Commission president","PRESIDENT MICHAEL D Higgins has said Israel “announcing in advance” that it would break international law in Gaza reduces the Geneva Convention to “tatters”.
He also hit out at European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen following her visit to Israel last week, saying that she doesn’t speak for Ireland.
President Higgins was speakingfollowing an address to the World Food Forum in Rome.
Speaking the Headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nation, President Higgins said there was “unanimous revulsion against the killing of civilians” by Hamas.
Hamas gunmen burst through the heavily militarised border around the Gaza Strip on 7 October and killed more than 1,300 people, mainly civilians.
President Higgins said there was particular “horror” at the killing of people at a music concert, which included22-year-old Irish-Israeli citizen Kim Damti.
However, he added: “One has to bear in mind how important it is to retain and insist on the veracity and the cogency of international law.”
Israel today announced there would be no temporary truce to allow aid in or foreigners out of the Gaza Strip, as fears grow over the dire humanitarian situation faced by millions of Palestinians trapped in the heavily bombarded territory.
Israel’s army has told people in the north of the Gaza Strip – nearly half of its 2.4-million population – to head south to safety, ahead of an expected ground offensive.
“It’s one thing, when we look at historic breaches of international law, that is incredibly bad,” said President Higgins, “but to actually announce in advance that you’re going to break international law, and that you announce it again and again, and that you do so on an innocent population.
“I have thought about it and I think that it really reduces all that code that was there from the Second World War through the Geneva Conventions about the protection of civilians, it reduces it to tatters.”
President Higgins said 350,000 people are being assisted in Gaza through the World Food Programme and that a “huge humanitarian crisis” has been created.

“The breaking of international law as retaliation is simply something that countries who subscribe to the United Nations Charter, to humanitarian law and to international law in general must be forthright about,” said President Higgins.
He added: “You do need to be quite straightforward about where you stand in relation to international law.”
President Higgins also said we cannot “ignore the long-neglected source of much of this conflict, which is the Palestinian issues”.
He also criticised the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.
President Higgins’ criticism of von der Leyen comes just days after she undertook a visit to Israel with the president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola.
“Hamas’ despicable actions are the hallmark of terrorists. And I know that how Israel responds will show that it is a democracy,” von der Leyen declared on her visit last Friday.
“What I saw and what I heard is breaking my heart. The blood of people killed in their sleep. The stories of innocents burned alive or slaughtered in their homes,” she said.
“They aim to eradicate Jewish life from the land, and they took action.”
According to her office’s account of the meeting, von der Leyen promised that Europe would work more closely with Israel, Egypt and Jordan for “a peaceful and integrated Middle East”.
President Higgins told reporters today in Rome: “She (von der Leyen) wasn’t speaking for Ireland.
He added that it was a “thoughtless and even reckless set of actions” that was “unhelpful”.

Hospitals in Gaza on the brink of collapse as power set to run out in matter of hours,"HOSPITALS IN GAZA are on the brink of collapse as fuel reserves are set to run out in a matter of hours, as pressure mounts for assistance to arrive.
Meanwhile, the regional head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that Gaza has only “24 hours of water, electricity and fuel left”.
In an interview with AFP, WHO regional director for the eastern Mediterranean, Ahmed al-Mandhari, said that if aid is not allowed into the besieged territory, doctors will have to “prepare death certificates for their patients”.
Gaza is now barrelling towards “a real catastrophe”, Mandhari said.
It is estimated that at least 2,750 people, mainly civilians, have been killed by the Israeli air assault which was unleashed after the Hamas attack on civilians in south Israel that killed more than 1,400 people.
In astatementshared last night, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said that fuel reserves at all hospitals across Gaza were expected to last for an additional 24 hours.

“The shutdown of backup generators would place the lives of thousands of patients at risk,” the statement read.
Gaza’s sole power plant shut down for lack of fuel after Israel completely sealed off the 25-mile long territory following the Hamas attack.
A total of 22 hospitals in nothern Gaza are treating more than 2,000 patients, including “some on ventilators, some who need regular dialysis, in addition to children, infants and women”.
Mandhari said Gaza’s hospitals have run out of clean water, while “fuel shortages threaten electricity supply”.
As medical resources dry up, he said doctors – who know they cannot save everyone – are having to make impossible choices.
“They have to triage the patients who are coming in. They have no other choice. There are too many people, so some are left to die slow deaths.”

In Nasser Hospital, in the southern town of Khan Younis, intensive care rooms were packed with wounded patients, most of them children under the age of three. Hundreds of people with severe blast injuries have come to the hospital, where fuel is expected to run out by tonight.

There are 35 patients who require ventilators and another 60 on dialysis. Dr Mohammed Qandeel, a consultant at the critical care complex, said if fuel runs out, “it means the whole health system will be shut down”.
He added: “All these patients are in danger of death if the electricity is cut off.”
Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the territory’s largest, said it would bury 100 bodies in a mass grave as an emergency measure after its mortuary overflowed. Tens of thousands of people seeking safety have gathered in the hospital compound.
Gaza was already in a humanitarian crisis due to a growing shortage of water and medical supplies caused by the Israeli siege.
At a press conference yesterday, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, said: “An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding under our eyes.”
Palestinians wounded in Israeli bombardment are placed in a tent in a hospital's yard in Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo
He said that Gaza “is being strangled and it seems that the world right now has lost its humanity”.
“There is not one drop of water, not one grain of wheat, not a litre of fuel that has been allowed into the Gaza Strip for the last eight days,” he said.
“Thousands of people have been killed, including children and women. Gaza is now even running out of body bags.”
Mandhari said aid must be allowed to enter the Gaza Strip within one day before the situation becomes completely unmanageable.
In a statement yesterday, the general director of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Paris, Claire Magone, urged Israel to organise and maintain safe areas “where people can hope to be spared from the bombs” and organise an evacuation route.
“Hospitals are overwhelmed. There are no more painkillers now. Our staff tells us about the wounded screaming in pain, the injured, the sick who cannot get to the hospital and the terror of finding themselves bombed in a few hours,” the statement read.
“Other people tell us about the impossibility of going out for even one hour to get supplies. In the south of Gaza, where people were called to move to by the Israeli authorities, the situation is extremely difficult.
“People are crowded into makeshift precarious camps, where access to water and food is extremely problematic. Bombings also continue in southern Gaza. Our teams report that accessing water is difficult, and is getting worse by the hour. Gaza’s water shortage has now reached a critical threshold.”
Magone also urged Israeli authorities to restore access to essential services, including drinking water, adding that due to a lack of fuel, there is now no longer any drinking water being produced in Gaza.

Around 40 Irish citizens in Gaza require evacuation,"AROUND 40 IRISH citizens are in the besieged Gaza Strip awaiting help to evacuate.
As humanitarian workers call for urgent corridors to be established to allow supplies to flow in and residents to flee, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with French President Emmanuel Macron last night to discuss the two countries’ approach to evacuating citizens.
The Irish citizens in Gaza are either members of UN staff or dual citizens, according to the Taoiseach.
Speaking to RTÉ News, Varadkar said that he and Macron discussed the need for humanitarian corridors as Israel continues to strike Gaza and essential supplies such as food, water, electricity and medicines run short.
“We also talked about our various citizens who are in Gaza and how we might assist each other in evacuating them if needs be,” the Taoiseach said.
“I think it’s fair to say that we have a shared view on the situation and how it might develop. We’re both very concerned about escalation and the situation getting worse and maybe spreading to the West Bank or Lebanon.”
Similarly, Executive Director of UNICEF Ireland Peter Power has warned that there is a “potentially catastrophic humanitarian crisis unfolding before our eyes”.
Power, who was the Minister of State for Overseas Development from 2009 to 2011, told RTÉ Radio One: “Gaza is completely enclosed and extremely densely populated. It relies on food, water, medicines.”
“Water is of increasing concern to UNICEF now. We have worked for years now in a desalinisation plant, just south of Gaza City,” he said.

“We’re very worried that lack of fuel will cause that to close down, we’re very worried that lack of fuel will close the hospitals down within the next 24 hours.”
He confirmed there are approximately 40 Irish citizens in Gaza.
“I know that there are diplomatic efforts underway through the Department of Foreign Affairs to try to extract Irish people to the southern crossing, if that crossing can be stabilised over the coming days.”
The US is in discussions to open Gaza’s Rafa border crossing to foreign nationals who want to flee, according to a senior US official said, as Israel prepares to commence a major offensive in the Strip.
“That is also something we discussed with Israel, something we continue to discuss with Egypt -— the importance of the Rafah crossing being open for American citizens and for foreign nationals of other countries who want to leave and have the right to leave,” the official said.
Meanwhile, fire along the Israeli-Lebanese border has intensified in the last week, prompting Israel to shutter the area to civilians.
Yesterday, a rocket hit the UN peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah attacks killed one person in Israel, the Israeli military said.
The Journalunderstands that eight personnel from the Irish Defence Forces who were at the camp are safe and accounted for.
That rocket that hit the UN base is thought to have been a misfired Hezbollah rocket fired from close to the city of Tyre.
More than 10 people have been killed in Lebanon and at least two in Israel in the past week. Among those killed in Lebanon was a Reuters journalist, Issam Abdallah.

One million people in Gaza flee homes as Israel readies ground invasion,"
MORE THAN ONE million people have fled their homes in Gaza in scenes of chaos and despair as Israel bombarded the Hamas-ruled territory and continued massing troops in preparation for a full-blown ground invasion.
Israel declared war on the Islamist group a day after waves of its fighters broke through the heavily fortified border on 7 October, shooting, stabbing and burning to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
After it suffered the deadliest attack in its history, Israel unleashed a relentless bombing campaign of the Gaza Strip that has flattened neighbourhoods and killed at least 2,670 people, mainly civilians.
Following an Israeli order to move to the south of the Gaza Strip, people have fled their homes in the north of the enclave to seek shelter wherever they can, including on the streets and in UN-run schools.
Palestinians carrying whatever belongings they can, in bags and suitcases, or packed onto three-wheeled motorbikes, battered cars, vans and even donkey carts have become a common sight.
“No electricity, no water, no internet. I feel like I’m losing my humanity,” said Mona Abdel Hamid, 55, who fled Gaza City to Rafah in the south of the enclave, and is having to stay with strangers.

A bereaved and infuriated Israel has massed forces outside the long-blockaded enclave of 2.4 million in preparation for what the army has said would be a land, air and sea attack involving a “significant ground operation”.
“We are at the beginning of intense or enhanced military operations in Gaza City,” spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Jonathan Conricus said.
“It would be unsafe for civilians to stay there,” he added.
Hamas backer Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which is also supported by Tehran, have warned that an invasion of Gaza would be met with a response.

“No one can guarantee the control of the situation and the non-expansion of the conflicts” if Israel sends its soldiers into Gaza, said Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.

The UN said today that 47 entire families, amounting to around 500 people, have been wiped out in Israel’s bombing campaign.
Foreign governments and aid agencies, including the UN and Red Cross, have repeatedly criticised Israel’s evacuation order.
The UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees said yesterday that some one million Palestinians had already been displaced in the first week of the conflict – but the number is likely to be higher.
Lynn Hastings, the UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, decried that Israel was connecting humanitarian aid into Gaza with the release of scores of hostages kidnapped during the Hamas attack.

“Neither should be conditional,” she insisted in a video posted by the UN.
“They have said they want to destroy Hamas, but their current trajectory is going to destroy Gaza.”
In Gaza, hospitals are becoming overwhelmed with increasing numbers of dead and injured, with officials saying yesterday that some 9,600 people have been wounded.
Israeli energy minister Israel Katz yesterday said water supplies to southern Gaza had been switched back on.
But power outages threaten to cripple life-support systems, from sea water desalination plants to food refrigeration and hospital incubators.
Even everyday functions — from going to the toilet, showering and washing clothes — are almost impossible, locals said.
Gazans are effectively trapped, with Israeli-controlled crossings closed and Egypt also having shut the Rafah border in the south.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due to hold talks in Israel today after a crisis tour of Middle Eastern countries in a frantic attempt to avert a wider crisis.
Blinken said he was confident the crossing “will be open” for aid into the strip, amid reports that Egypt was blocking the passage of Gazans with foreign passports until relief supplies are allowed in.
He categorically rejected the idea floated of expelling Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.

Demonstration held in Dublin in solidarity with Israel,"A DEMONSTRATION IN solidarity with Israel was held in Dublin today.
Members of the Israeli community in Ireland expressed their fears for loved ones in Israel, amidst the war with the Hamas militant group which began eight days ago.
A rally at Leinster House was followed by a march to the Israeli embassy, where a prayer service was held.
RTÉ reported that the demonstrators were thanked by the Israeli ambassador, Dana Erlich.
On its social media, the embassy welcomed the demonstration as a “show of solidarity and strength”.

Organisers said they were “praying and wishing for better, safer days for all”, adding that the event was an opportunity for attendees to show the world their compassion towards Israel’s situation.
Speaking outside Leinster House, Alan Shatter, former Fine Gael Minister for Justice, called on Irish politicians to “stop lecturing to Israel how to defend its citizens”.

Israel readies troops for invasion of Gaza as hospital patients survive on generator power,"LAST UPDATE|15 Oct 2023
ISRAEL IS PRESSING on with preparations for a ground offensive in Gaza, after giving Palestinians a little more time to flee northern areas it has vowed to target in response to the deadliest attack in its history.
Hamas fighters gunned down, stabbed and burned to death more than 1,400 people in the attack that has sparked a massive retaliatory bombing campaign that has killed over 2,450 in Gaza.
That toll makes this the deadliest of the five Gaza wars for both sides. This is the deadliest war for Israel since the 1973 conflict with Egypt and Syria.
Israel has warned around 1.1 million Gazans living in the north of the Palestinian territory to flee to the south ahead of a ground incursion which the military has indicated will focus on Gaza City, the base of the leadership of the Hamas militant group.
The military said Gaza City residents must not delay their departure but a spokesperson said late on Saturday they still had time to leave and that the ground offensive would not start on Sunday.
Since Friday thousands of Gazans who have packed what belongings they can into bags and suitcases, have tried to trudge through the rubble-strewn streets.
A stream of cars, trucks, three-wheeled vehicles and donkey-drawn carts joined the frantic mass movement south, all loaded with families and their belongings, mattresses, bedding and bags strapped onto the roofs of packed vehicles.
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said today that Israel told him it has turned the water supply back on in southern Gaza.
“I have been in touch with my Israeli counterparts just within the last hour who reported to me that they have, in fact, turned the water pipe back on in southern Gaza,” Sullivan told CNN.
In a statement issued today, the European Union stressed “Israel’s right to defend itself in line with humanitarian and international law in the face of such violent and indiscriminate attacks” by Hamas.
“We reiterate the importance of the provision of urgent humanitarian aid and stand ready to continue supporting those civilians most in need in Gaza… ensuring that such assistance is not abused by terrorist organisations,” the statement said, adding, “it is crucial to prevent regional escalation” of the conflict.
Collective punishment of the sort Israel is inflicting on Gaz, withholding food, water, fuel and shutting off power to the city, is a war crime under the terms of the Geneva Convention.
With power, water and fuel being withheld by Israel, the patients unable to leave hospitals in Gaza face the threat of bombardment.
Hospitals are expected to run out of generator fuel within two days, according to the UN, which said that the lives of thousands of patients would be in danger.
Gaza’s sole power plant shut down for lack of fuel after Israel completely sealed off the 40km-long territory following the Hamas attack.
In Nasser Hospital, in the southern town of Khan Younis, intensive care rooms were packed with wounded patients, most of them children under the age of three.
Hundreds of people with severe blast injuries have attended the hospital, where fuel was expected to run out by tomorrow, according to Dr Mohammed Qandeel, a consultant at the critical care complex.
There were 35 patients in the ICU who required ventilators and another 60 on dialysis.
If fuel runs out “it means the whole health system will be shut down”, he said.
“All these patients are in danger of death if the electricity is cut off.”
Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, the head of paediatrics at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, said it did not evacuate despite Israeli orders.
There were seven newborns in the ICU hooked up to ventilators, he said.
“We cannot evacuate, that would mean death for them and other patients under our care,” he added.
Patients keep arriving with severed limbs, severe burns and other life-threatening injuries.

“It’s frightening,” he said.
The Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the territory’s largest, said it would bury 100 bodies in a mass grave as an emergency measure after its morgue overflowed, with relatives unable to bury their loved ones.
Tens of thousands of people seeking safety had gathered in the hospital compound.

Israel pummelled northern Gaza with fresh air strikes yesterday. AFP reporters near the southern Israeli city of Sderot saw troops fire at the densely populated city, sending huge plumes of black smoke into the sky.
The Israeli military said the bodies of some of the dozens of hostages abducted by Hamas in its attacks had been found during operations inside Gaza.
Hamas earlier reported 22 hostages had been killed in Israeli bombardments.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wearing a flak jacket, earlier visited troops on the border front line, raising expectations of an imminent invasion.
“Are you ready for what is coming? More is coming,” he was heard telling several soldiers on a video released by his office.
Israel has faced pressure from the United Nations and its allies to hold back on any invasion until civilians have been given every chance to leave. The military has not said when the safe passage windows will close.
Military spokesmen Lieutenant Richard Hecht and Daniel Hagari told separate briefings today that “a political decision” will set off any action against Hamas.
“We will be holding discussions with our political leadership,” Hecht told one briefing.
Israel has massed tens of thousands of troops around Gaza and officials say that all necessary military supplies have been carried out. Thousands of air raids have been staged in Gaza since last week’s attacks, claiming more than 2,300 lives in the densely populated territory.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant discussed the evacuation of Gaza civilians and “humanitarian issues” in talks with US senators today, his department said.
Gallant, who has referred to Palestinians as “human animals”, stressed “Israel’s military power and our determination to destroy the enemy”.
Military spokesmen have told reporters that any invasion would aim to eradicate Hamas’ militant network and leadership so that it cannot stage more attacks.
The Israeli military has particularly singled out Yahya Sinwar, the chief of Hamas in Gaza they blame for the 7 October attacks. “That man is in our sights,” Hecht said yesterday. “He is a dead man walking and we will get to that man.”
The United States has deployed a second aircraft carrier to “deter hostile actions against Israel”, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said.
Alarm has grown over the fate of Palestinian civilians in blockaded and besieged Gaza – one of the world’s most densely populated areas, home to 2.4 million people – if it becomes the scene of intense urban combat and house-to-house fighting.
Aid agencies have said forcing Gazans to move is impossible while the war rages.
But with food, water, fuel and medical supplies running low because of an Israeli blockade, aid agencies are warning of a deepening humanitarian crisis.
“The situation is catastrophic,” said Jumaa Nasser, who travelled from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza with his wife, mother and seven children.
“We’ve had no food or sleep. We don’t know what to do. I’ve given my fate up to God,” he told AFP.
The World Health Organization said yesterday that forcing thousands of patients to evacuate to already overflowing hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip could be “tantamount to a death sentence”.
Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) issued a statement yesterday saying that the areas designated as “safe” by Israel were in fact being bombed.
“Despite Israeli announcements suggesting that there are safe areas for the population trapped in the Gaza Strip, they are in fact exposed to bombardment throughout all the territory, including in the south, where tens of thousands of people have fled following the ultimatum.

MSF called for “the most elementary humanity to be shown” and described the order to move 1.1 million people who have been deprived of food and water as “absurd as it is intolerable.”
“Our teams are witnessing the fact that drinking water is becoming scarce in the south of the Gaza Strip and the difficulty of obtaining it is adding to the distress of the population.
MSF urgently calls for the restoration of sufficient and immediate access to drinking water for the population of the Gaza Strip.
“We are extremely worried about the fate of those who will not be able to move, such as the wounded, the sick and the medical staff, who we fear will be wiped out in view of the statements made by the Israeli military authorities.
“MSF is calling for safe zones to remain in the north and for regular ceasefires. We are also calling for the possibility to flee through the Rafah crossing for those who wish to do so, without prejudice to the right to return.”
Exiled Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh has accused Israel of committing “war crimes” in Gaza but he ruled out any “displacement” of Gazans, including to Egypt.
Hamas is regularly accused by Israel of using civilians as “human shields”.
On the diplomatic front, Chinese envoy Zhai Jun will visit the Middle East next week to push for a ceasefire and promote peace talks, state broadcaster CCTV reported today.
Saudi Arabia has also pressed for an “immediate ceasefire”. Russia said it had asked the UN Security Council to vote tomorrow on its ceasefire resolution.
Pope Francis has urged Israel to provide safe passage for civillians.
“Humanitarian law must be respected, especially in Gaza, where it is urgent and necessary to guarantee humanitarian corridors and help the population,” said the Pope after his traditional Angelus prayer in Rome’s Saint Peter’s Square.
“I strongly urge that children, the sick, the elderly, women and all civillians should not fall victim to the conflict”, he added.
Israel is not interested in having a war on its northern frontier with Lebanon, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said as tensions mount between the two countries.
Israel has stationed troops and tanks on its UN-patrolled northern border with Lebanon and closed a four kilometre wide zone to civilians after deadly exchanges of cross-border fire with Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.
“We have no interest in a war in the north, we don’t want to escalate the situation,” Gallant said in a video released by his office, as he visited troops in the country’s south.
“If Hezbollah chooses the path of war, it will pay a very heavy price… But if it restrains itself, we’ll respect the situation and keep things the way they are, despite them being in a process of shooting from both sides.”
Meanwhile, Iran has warned that any Israeli ground offensive in the Gaza Strip could expand the scope of the conflict elsewhere in the Middle East.
Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian held talks with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, as Israeli troops massed on the border with Gaza.
“No one can guarantee the control of the situation and the non-expansion of the conflicts,” he said, according to an Iranian foreign ministry statement.
“Those who are interested in preventing the scope of war and crisis from expanding, need to prevent the current barbaric attacks… against citizens and civilians in Gaza,” he added.
Amir-Abdollahian also criticised the United States, which has given its unequivocal backing to Israel since last week’s attacks by Hamas.
In Washington, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the United States feared an escalation of war, and the prospect of Iran – Israel’s long-time foe and supporter of Hamas – becoming “directly engaged”.
Iran’s top diplomat was in Qatar today as part of a regional tour that also included stops in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria.

Today we are observing intense exchanges of fire in several areas along the Blue Line between Lebanese territory and Israel.
Separately, Hamas has claimed responsibility for two infiltrations from Lebanon to Israel that killed three of its fighters, as war rages between the Gaza-based militants and Israel.
The Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ armed wing, said its members were “able… to blow up the border fence and… go forth inside occupied Palestine,” clashing with “the enemy”, whose planes targeted the fighters, killing three on Saturday.
Yesterday, Israeli forces had said they killed several “terrorists” trying to cross from Lebanon.
In their statement, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades also claimed responsibility for an incident on Friday at the border when the group “advanced to go forth into occupied Palestine and was able to clash with the Zionist enemy army and withdraw peacefully,” on Friday.
Two Lebanese security sources had said on Friday that Israel shelled the southern Lebanon border region, after a blast occurred on the border fence, according to the Israeli army.
One of the security sources said the shelling followed an infiltration attempt from the Lebanese side of the border, while the Israeli army said it was responding to a blast that caused “light damage” to the border barrier.

THOUSANDS OF DEMONSTRATORS have gathered in Dublin to protest against the Israeli military operation in Gaza.
Other marches have also been planned across the country including in Cork city.
The demonstration marched through Dublin city centre with banners and made its way to the Israeli Embassy in Ballsbridge, Dublin 4.
The crowd carried banners with slogans showing solidarity with Palestinian civilians and Palestinian flags.
A second demonstration, organised in solidarity with Israel, will take place in Dublin city centre this evening.
Earlier today, Palestinian officials said the death toll from Israeli airstrikes in Gaza was 2,215, including 724 children.
Some 458 women were among those killed, the ministry said. It added that 8,714 people have also been wounded, after an earlier statement said at least 324 people were killed in the past 24 hours alone.
More than 1,300 people have been killed in Israel in attacks from Hamas militants, while more than 3,200 other people had been wounded, the Israeli army said on X, formerly Twitter.
Israel has launched bombing raids inside Gaza and also trade fire with militants in Lebanon.
Rocket launches by Hamas militants have also continued targeting a number of Israeli cities and areas.

Meanwhile, The Red Cross said today it was “appalled” by the human misery unleashed by the war between Hamas and Israel, saying its volunteers would not abandon those who needed them most.
It called on both sides to abide by international humanitarian law, protect civilians and allow humanitarian organisations to alleviate the growing levels of suffering.
“The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is appalled to see the human misery that has unfolded over the last week in Israel and Gaza,” with civilians paying the highest price.
“Nothing can justify the horrific loss of civilian lives in Israel last weekend… but such tragedy cannot in turn justify the limitless destruction of Gaza,” the Red Cross statement said.
The Red Cross chiefs said there was “devastating” human suffering on all sides, and in international humanitarian law, “there is no hierarchy in pain and suffering”.
Tens of thousands of people gathered for pro-Palestinian demonstrations across the UK amid growing international concern over the situation in Israel and Gaza.
Marchers filled the streets of central London on Saturday as thousands also gathered in Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh and other parts of the UK.
Demonstrators carried flags and flares and chanted pro-Palestinian slogans as marchers heard calls for world leaders to condemn Israel’s actions.

"Thousands attempt to flee northern Gaza as death toll from Israeli strikes passes 2,000","LAST UPDATE|14 Oct 2023
THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS have fled to southern Gaza seeking refuge after Israel warned them to evacuate before an expected ground offensive against Hamas in retaliation for the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that nearly a week of fierce bombardment was “just the beginning” as Israel seeks to retaliate against Hamas after their fighters killed more than 1,300 a week ago.
A senior military commander of Hamas who headed the group’s aerial operations in Gaza City has been killed in Israeli air strikes, the military has said.
Murad Abu Murad was killed over the past day when fighter jets struck an operational centre of Hamas from where the group carried out its “aerial activity”, the military said.
There was no immediate confirmation from Hamas.
Israeli ground forces made “localised” raids into Gaza in the past 24 hours “to cleanse the area of terrorists and weaponry” and try to find “missing persons”, the army said.
Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip have killed at least 2,215 people, including 724 children, the Palestinian territory’s Hamas-controlled health ministry said today.
Some 458 women were among those killed, the ministry said. It added that 8,714 people have also been wounded, after an earlier statement said at least 324 people were killed in the past 24 hours alone.
“Where to go?” asked Umm Hossam, 29, who was among the thousands fleeing.
“How long will the strikes and death last? We have no homes left, every area of Gaza is under threat,” said the 29-year-old, her face streaked with tears.
Hamas took about 150 Israeli, foreign and dual national hostages back to Gaza in the initial attack, Israel has said.
The militant group said yesterday that 13 of them had been killed in Israeli air strikes.
The Israeli military said that Gaza City residents must not delay their departure before the expected ground offensive starts.
Israel has designated two safe routes for more than one million residents of northern Gaza to leave for the south of the blockaded territory.
Military spokesman Richard Hecht said there is a safe passage “window” between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm local time on the roads, down the Gaza coast and through the centre of the narrow Palestinian territory, which is about 40 kilometres long.
Without saying how many days the window would remain, Hecht told reporters: “We know this is going to take time but we recommend people not to delay.”
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking in Israel yesterday, accused Hamas of using residents as a “shield” in Gaza, where Israel has cut off water, fuel and food supplies.
The term “human shield” is commonly used by Israeli officials when describing the civilian population of Gaza.
US President Joe Biden spoke with the families of 14 Americans who have been missing since the Hamas attack Friday.
“We’re going to do everything in our power to find them,” he told CBS’s “60 Minutes”.
He also stressed that addressing the swelling humanitarian crisis in Gaza was a “priority”.
“The overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and Hamas’s appalling attacks, and they’re suffering as a result as well,” Biden said in a speech.
In the occupied West Bank, at least 16 Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli forces during protests supporting Gaza, the health ministry said.
Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh accused Israel of committing “genocide” in Gaza.
But Netanyahu’s spokeswoman Tal Heinrich told AFP: “Everything that happens in Gaza is Hamas’s responsibility.”
Thousands also demonstrated in support of the Palestinians yesterday in Beirut, Iraq, Iran and in Jordan. A similar protest is planned for this afternoon in Dublin.
Demonstrations also took place in Bahrain, where US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting today, as part of a regional tour seeking to keep calm in the Arab world.
Saudi Arabia has suspended talks on potentially normalising ties with Israel, a source has told AFP.
“Saudi Arabia has decided to pause discussion on possible normalisation and has informed US officials,” a source familiar with the discussions told AFP.
Saudi Arabia in the weeks before the attacks had spoken of progress in US-led diplomacy to normalise relations with Israel – which would be a landmark step for the kingdom that is home to Islam’s two holiest sites.
But Riyadh has voiced increasing disquiet about the fate of Palestinians in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.
Yesterday, Saudi Arabia denounced the displacement of Palestinians within Gaza and attacks on “defenceless civilians”, its strongest language criticising Israel since the war broke out.
Riyadh “affirms its categorical rejection of calls for the forced displacement of the Palestinian people from Gaza, and its condemnation of the continued targeting of defenceless civilians there,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
In Gaza, UN officials said the Israeli military, whose troops are massing at the border, had said some 1.1 million people in the north of the enclave needed to evacuate to the south “within the next 24 hours”.
Yesterday, Tánaiste Micheál Martincalled on Israel to rescind its evacuation orderfrom northern Gaza and said that moving 1 million people in that time “simply isn’t feasible”.
Israel did not confirm it had set the deadline, but later admitted it would take more time.
The United Nations described the immediate movement of nearly half of the 2.4 million in the Gaza Strip as “impossible” called for the evacuation order to be rescinded.
“Moving more than one million people across a densely populated war zone to a place with no food, water, or accommodation, when the entire territory of Gaza is under siege, is extremely dangerous – and in some cases, simply not possible,” UN chief Antonio Guterres said on X (formerly Twitter).
Hospitals are struggling to cope with the dead and wounded  and the health system was “at a breaking point”, the World Health Organization said.
In Jordan, after a meeting with Blinken, King Abdullah II called for “humanitarian corridors” to be opened urgently.
Egypt and Israel have agreed to let US citizens leave the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing on Saturday as Israel carries out strikes against Hamas, a US official said.
The two US partners agreed to keep the sole crossing from Gaza to Egypt open from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm local time, said a US official accompanying Secretary of State Antony Blinken on a regional tour, and adding that Qatar spoke with Hamas to encourage cooperation.
AFP correspondents in Gaza said the Israeli military dropped flyers yesterday warning residents to flee “immediately” south of Wadi Gaza, with a map pointing south across a line in the centre of the 40 kilometre-long territory.
The army said it “will continue to operate significantly in Gaza City and make extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians”.
“Hamas terrorists are hiding in Gaza City inside tunnels underneath houses and inside buildings populated with innocent civilians.”
Netanyahu has vowed to “crush” Hamas, and has likened it to the Islamic State group.
But in Geneva, the Red Cross said the unjustifiable “horrific” attacks on Israel could equally not justify “the limitless destruction of Gaza”.
Hamas has said Palestinians rejected the evacuation request, yet thousands of Gazans were on the move in search of safety, carrying plastic bags of belongings, suitcases on their shoulders and children in their arms.
Even before the evacuation order, more than 423,000 people had already fled their homes in Gaza, according to the UN.

Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh has accused Israel of committing war crimes.
“Israeli atrocities amount to war crimes,” he said in a letter addressed to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that was posted on the Palestinian group’s website.
Arab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit said Israel’s evacuation order is a “forced transfer” that constitutes “a crime”.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said it will be “tantamount to a second Nakba” or “catastrophe”, referring to the 760,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 war that accompanied Israel’s creation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Israel risked waging an “unacceptable” siege in Gaza comparable to the Nazi blockade of Leningrad during World War II.
Moscow’s Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov hopes to meet representatives of Hamas in Qatar next week for talks to free Israeli hostages, Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency has reported.
Bogdanov told RIA Novosti he “did not exclude” meeting Hamas on the trip, adding: “If they are willing, we always are in favour of contact. Especially in this situation (the meeting) would be useful for solving practical issues, including the freeing of hostages.”
Iran has said it was still possible to prevent a regional spillover of Israel’s war with Islamist group Hamas but warned that time was quickly running out.
Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian was speaking from the Lebanese capital Beirut.
“There is still a political opportunity to prevent a widespread crisis in the region,” Amir-Abdollahian told a press conference in Beirut after stops in Baghdad and Damascus.
But “maybe, in the next few hours, it will be too late,” he said, warning that pro-Iran militants “have designed all the scenarios and are prepared, and their finger is on the trigger to shoot.”
Although Tehran has long backed Hamas – which rules Gaza – financially and militarily, Iran has denied involvement in the group’s attack on Israel.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on China, a partner of Iran, to use its influence to push for calm in the Middle East.
The top US diplomat, who was visiting Saudi Arabia, had a “productive” one-hour telephone call with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.
“Our message was that he thinks it’s in our shared interest to stop the conflict from spreading.” Miller told reporters on Blinken’s plane from Riyadh to Abu Dhabi.
“He thought it could be useful if China could use its influence.”
Wang for his part said that the United States should “play a constructive and responsible role, pushing the issue back on track for a political settlement as soon as possible,” according to a readout published by the Chinese foreign ministry.
“When dealing with international hot-spot issues, major countries must adhere to objectivity and fairness, maintain calmness and restraint, and take the lead in abiding by international law,” said Wang.
The Chinese foreign minister added that Beijing called for “the convening of an international peace meeting as soon as possible to promote the reaching of broad consensus”.
“The fundamental outlet for the Palestinian issue lies in implementing a ‘two-state solution’,” said Wang.
China’s official statements on the conflict have not specifically named Hamas in their condemnations of violence, leading to criticism from some Western officials who said they were too weak.
Tensions have risen across the Middle East and beyond, with angry protests in support of the Palestinians, while Israel faces the threat of a separate confrontation with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
A Reuters video journalist, Issam Abdallah, was killed and six other reporters – from AFP, Reuters and Al Jazeera – were injured in southern Lebanon close to Israel, when caught up in cross-border shelling.

The Israeli army said today it was “very sorry” for the death of the Reuters journalist.
“We are very sorry for the journalist’s death,” military spokesman Richard Hecht told reporters when asked about the killing of the Reuters videographer on Friday.
The Israeli military did not acknowledge responsibility, however.
“We are looking into it,” Hecht said of the incident in which six other journalists, including two from AFP, were also injured.
Following the attack, Al Jazeera Media Network said in a statement that Israeli forces had “once again attempted to silence the media by targeting journalists”.
“Israel’s targeting of the Al Jazeera team is a blatant disregard of international safety standards that clearly distinguish the press, as they shelled and burned an Al Jazeera broadcast vehicle despite our crew’s presence alongside other international media in an agreed upon location,” the network said.
Israeli forces have said they killed several “terrorists” trying to cross from Lebanon amid heightened tensions and after repeated cross-border shelling.
The military “identified a terrorist cell which attempted to infiltrate from Lebanon into Israeli territory,” a military spokesman said, adding that a drone strike “targeted the terrorist cell and killed a number of the terrorists”.
Israel was behind the cross-border rocket fire that killed and injured the journalists, the Lebanese army has said.
“The Israeli enemy fired a rocket shell that hit a civilian car belonging to a media team, leading to the death of Issam Abdallah,” a Reuters journalist, and wounding several others yesterday, it said in a statement.
The Lebanese army said in a statement that “the Israeli enemy fired a rocket shell that hit a civilian car belonging to a media team, leading to the death of Issam Abdallah”.
Lebanon’s foreign ministry also blamed Israel and labelled the strike a “deliberate killing” and a “crime against freedom of speech and journalism”.
The group of journalists from different media, wearing press vests and helmets, was near the village of Alma al-Shaab, close to the border with Israel, when they came under “direct” fire, according to two eyewitnesses.
AFP photographer Christina Assi and AFP video journalist Dylan Collins were among the six journalists wounded.
Collins said there had been no outgoing fire from their location prior to the strike launched from the Israeli side of the border.
“We were filming smoke billowing from Israeli artillery fire targeting a distant hill in front of us,” Collins said.
“There was no military activity in our direct vicinity and no artillery fire near us.”
The journalists were standing in an open area when they heard small arms fire from a different direction further west, along the border with Israel, according to Collins, who spoke from the hospital.
“When we turned our cameras to look closer, we were hit directly by what seemed to be a rocket strike from the Israeli side,” Collins said.
Shortly after, he said, “we were hit again, directly, in the same place and from the same area. Two direct strikes on the same area.”
Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement said yesterday that it was “fully prepared” to join its Palestinian ally Hamas in the war against Israel when the time is right.
Arab countries and the United Nations have urged Hezbollah to stay out of the growing conflict, but the Lebanese-based group’s deputy chief Naim Qassem said the movement would not be swayed.
Amid the mounting tensions, Israel shelled two villages in south Lebanon near the border yesterday, Lebanese security sources said, following a blast on the border fence.
On Monday, Hezbollah had said Israeli strikes had killed three of its members, while Palestinian fighters claimed a thwarted infiltration bid.
On Tuesday, Israel said it hit Hezbollah observation posts and a day later, Hezbollah said it targeted an Israeli position near the Lebanese village of Dhayra. Retaliatory Israeli fire wounded three people.

Irish troops take shelter as Israeli shelling hits southern Lebanon and journalist is killed,"LAST UPDATE|13 Oct 2023
IRISH TROOPS HAVE taken shelter in bunkers as Israel launched attacks near their base in south Lebanon as Israeli troops traded fire with Hezbollah militants in the area.
It is understood Israeli artillery hit a Reuters news crew who were streaming live.
A group of journalists from several outlets were near Alma al-Shaab in south Lebanon close to the border when they were hit by Israeli fire. Several journalists were wounded and Reuters has confirmed that its reporter journalist Issam Abdallah was killed.
“We are deeply saddened to learn that our videographer, Issam Abdallah, has been killed.
“We are urgently seeking more information, working with authorities in the region, and supporting Issam’s family and colleagues,” the news agency said.
In a statement on X, formerly Twitter, UNIFIL said: “This evening, at approximately 5.20pm, a heavy exchange of fire erupted between Lebanon and Israel in the vicinity of Alma Shaab, Ayta Ash Shab’, Al Dihaira, El Adeysse and Houla.
“We are deeply saddened to hear that during this exchange of fire a Lebanesse videographer has been killed with reports of other journalists injured.”

UNIFIL has actively engaged with authorities on both sides of the Blue Line to de-escalate the situation.
The biggest contingent of Irish troops in the region, 342 in total, is based insouth Lebanonin Camp Shamrock in At Tiri as part of United Nations Interim Force Lebanon (UNIFIL).
The Irish Defence Forces said all Irish troops are safe.
There is a second Irish base with a small contingent at an outpost which is located on the Israeli border known atCamp 6-52.
The base overlooks Israeli positions a short few hundred metres away.
The troops were put into bunkers, or in to groundhog as it is known in the military, also at the nearby coastal UNIFIL headquarters at Naqoura.

An engagement on Monday near Tyre, just north of the Irish base, saw three Hezbollah fighters killed.
Sources have said that while a majority of the soldiers in the Irish bases take shelter in the bunkers that a team of observers maintain observations.
They report this back into a command and control base and all engagements are documented.
Irish troops as part of their work with UNIFIL are mandated to assist the local population should people be injured also.
There are approximately 10,000 troops in the area of operations from many nations including Ireland’s partners Poland.
This is the second time this week that they have been placed in groundhog following Monday’s incident.
An Irish Defence Forces spokesperson confirmed that UNIFIL personnel have been dealing with several incidents over the last two days.
“In the last 48 Hrs there have been sporadic exchanges of fires across the Blue Line between Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) and Non-State Actors (NSA) in South Lebanon. The intensity of fires has decreased from its height on the 06 and 07 October.
“On several occasions since commencement of hostilities UNIFIL, and specifically IRISHPOLBATT have been subject to Groundhog (taking shelter in protected positions).
“The Irish troops of the 122nd Infantry Battalion in UNIFIL went into GROUNDHOG today at ~1430hrs (GMT) and continue to monitor the situation from protected positions.
“All Irish soldiers are accounted for and are safe. Once safe to do so they will continue to conduct planned framework operations. There are 342 Defence Forces personnel serving with UNIFIL,” the Irish military statement said.
The Irish Defence Forces said that troops serving in Syria with UNDOF of the 68th Infantry Group are maintaining high state of readiness but it is calm in the area.
The Irish personnel serving as UN Observers with UNTSO in Israel, Lebanon and Syria are maintaining a high level of vigilance and continue to monitor the situation.
“They are all safe and well and are complying with UN security precautions. This is predominantly focused around, considerations to unnecessary travel. There are 13 Defence Forces personnel serving with UNTSO,” the statement said.

EU extends warning about disinformation surrounding Israel-Hamas war to YouTube bosses,"LAST UPDATE|13 Oct 2023
THE EUROPEAN UNION has extended its warning to TikTok about illegal material and disinformation surrounding the war between Israel and Hamas to Google and YouTube.
The EU’s top tech enforcer, Commissioner Thierry Breton, warned Google parent Alphabet to be wary of potential “illegal content and disinformation” on its YouTube platform.
In the latest in a series of messages to tech CEOs that has already seen him sparring with Elon Musk on X, formerly Twitter, the EU industry commissioner wrote to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.
The letter was also posted online on the Bluesky social media platform, an upstart rival to Musk’s X, and warns YouTube to comply with the terms of the EU’s new Digital Services Act (DSA).
“Following the terrorist acts carried out by Hamas against Israel, we are seeing a surge of illegal content and disinformation being disseminated in the EU via certain platforms”, Breton wrote.
Fake or manipulated images, including old videos falsely claiming to show events in recent days, have been uploaded to the app, according to a letter sent earlier to TikTok’s CEO.
The EU Commission is coming down against social media giants with more force since new legislation called the Digital Services Act came into effect two months ago, requiring platforms to remove content that is illegal under EU law or in individual member states, or risk facing massive fines.
TikTok is the latest app to receive a warning after Meta (Facebook and Instagram) and X (formerly known as Twitter) were cautioned in recent days.

EU Commission Thierry Breton has written to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew to alert him that “following the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas against Israel, we have indications that TikTok is being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU”.
“Given that your platform is extensively used by children and teenagers, you have a particular obligation to protect them from violent content depicting hostage taking and other graphic videos which are reportedly widely circulating on your platform, without appropriate safeguards,” Breton said.
“As many users, particularly minors, turn to your platform as a source of news, reliable sources should be adequately differentiated from terrorist propaganda.”
He told the company that it must respond within the next 24 hours and take action to resolve the issue.

Earlier this year, Ireland appointed its first Digital Services Commissioner under the newly established media regulator Coimisiún na Meán. The role is intended to focus on protecting users of digital services from illegal or harmful content online.
Speaking on RTÉ Radio One’sMorning Irelandthis morning, Digital Services Commissioner John Evans said that “misinformation and disinformation online can be used by different actors for different purposes”.
“It’s a problem. It becomes much more aggravated at times of crisis when people are seeking out news and a malicious actor spots opportunities to exploit that,” Evans said.
“It’s right, I think, that Commissioner Breton has written to the platforms to remind them of what their responsibilities are.”

Calls mount for Israel to open humanitarian corridors to Gaza as clock ticks down,"URGENT APPEALS FROM neighbouring countries in the Middle East and around the world have been made to Israel today to open humanitarian corridors to Gaza as supplies run short and Palestinians in the north face an evacuation order.
Israel is blocking all access in and out of Gaza in a siege that it has threatened not to end until Hamas releases its hostages.
No exception has been made for humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, where essential supplies like food, water, fuel and medicines are expected to run out in a matter of days, and although Palestinians in the north of Gaza have been told to leave, they have little capacity to do so.
Egypt, which has a border crossing with Gaza that Israel has closed, is in “full support” of UN agencies trying to deliver aid.
Diplomat Sameh Shoukry, who hosted talks with the United Nation’s agency for Palestinian refugees on Wednesday, warned of the “dangerous humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip”.

US officials are working with Egypt to make a plan for a safety corridor from Gaza.
Fellow neighbour Jordan, which shares a long border with Israel to the west, has called for “opening humanitarian corridors to allow for the entry of urgent medical and relief aid to Gaza, and protecting civilians and stopping the escalation and war on Gaza”.
Further afield, the President of Brazil — which currently holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council – Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has appealed to Israel to allow a humanitarian corridor to open between Gaza and Egypt so that Palestinians under evacuation orders can flee.
Lula wrote on social media: “I recently spoke on the phone with the President of Israel Isaac Herzog. I conveyed my call for a humanitarian corridor so that people who want to leave the Gaza Strip through Egypt can be safe.”
“I asked the President for all possible initiatives to ensure that there is no shortage of water, electricity and medicines in hospitals,” he said.
Brazil has called a meeting of the UN Security Council today to address the spiralling conflict.

France orders ban on all pro-Palestinian protests,"
FRANCE HAS SAID it is banning all pro-Palestinian demonstrations after the attack on Israel by Hamas, on the grounds such protests threaten public order.
Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a note to regional prefects that the demonstrations “are likely to generate disturbances to public order”, adding that organisers should face arrest as well as any troublemakers.
In defiance of his order, several hundred people had gathered in the central Place de la Republique in Paris shouting pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli slogans, AFP correspondents said.
Darmanin had told French media earlier that over 100 “anti-Semitic acts” had been recorded in France since the attack by Hamas on Israel on Saturday, with 24 people arrested.

In his order to prefects, Darmanin also reiterated his request that foreigners guilty of any anti-Semitic offence or of advocating terrorism should have their residence permit “systematically withdrawn” and expelled “without delay” from France.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also said yesterday that Berlin will ban Hamas activities and organisations linked to the group in Germany.
“The federal interior ministry will ban Hamas from operating in Germany. An association like Samidoun, whose members celebrate the most brutal acts of terror on the open street, will be banned in Germany,” Scholz said in a speech to parliament.

 Moderate voices now matter most in the Middle East amid all the hate and anger","MOST OF THE world is looking on at events in Gaza and Israel with a shared sense of revulsion. The actions of a band of Hamas terrorists, who randomly massacred at least 1,200 innocent Israeli women, men and children, were incredibly barbaric.
The unspeakable tragedy has affected this country too as 22-year-old dual Irish-Israeli citizen, Kim Damti, was killed along with hundreds of other attendees at a music festival. Having seen the images of this vibrant young person, it is difficult to fathom that she is dead.
Now, the state of Israel has launched a series of attacks on Palestine withsigns this morningthat a more ferocious assault is imminent. In the wake of what independent experts at theUnited Nations describedas “indiscriminate military attacks against the already exhausted Palestinian people of Gaza” which constitute “collective punishment” and are “absolutely prohibited under international law and amounts to a war crime,” some 1,500 Palestinians have been slain. Many seasoned observers expect that this is only the tip of the iceberg.
Public representatives on both sides are dug into a war footing and their rhetoric is deeply worrying. In a profoundly disturbingMorning Ireland interview last Monday, Palestine’s head of mission here, Ambassador Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid, was asked to convey her sentiments on what happened in Israel. She asserted that she found the killings to be “shocking,” but that she was not going to criticise Hamas. Later pushed by presenter Audrey Carville as to whether she felt sympathy for Israeli victims and their loved ones, she declined to answer.
Meanwhile, Israel’s Defence Minister Yoan Gallantannouncedthat his country is fighting “human animals” and a diplomatic colleague averred that “all gloves were off” as Israel moves from a policy of “containment to eradication.” This has included the deliberate bombing of hospitals and universities, as well as the cutting off of electricity, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza.

It is impossible to gauge where this is going or how and when it might end, yet it appears a safe bet that things will get a lot worse before they get any better. Of course, the cruellest consequence of these renewed hostilities is what has been and will continue to be experienced by people who merely wish to carry on with the normal lives we take for granted and who are caught up in a war by accidents of birth and geography.
An extraordinary, and hugely depressing, corollary of what has been unfolding since Saturday is the objectively irrational response of many steadfast champions of Israel and Palestine from beyond the region. Prior to assessing what has been said by a number of prominent figures, it is crucial to take note, albeit briefly, of what is a tortured history.
Put bluntly and simplistically, it is very messy. It is entirely justifiable for students of the past to align more with either Israel or Palestine (for the record, I tend toward the latter). Owing to a variety of complex factors and regrettable occurrences, some compelling moral arguments can be made in support of each.
In the aftermath of the Hamas violence, Richard Boyd Barrett TDtook to Twitter (X)to say that Palestinians “have every right to resist” and his party colleagues have relentlessly expressed their “full solidarity” with them.

Boyd Barrett alsotold the Al Mayadeen news agencythat “the violence we have seen in the last few days did not begin with the events of the weekend.” Why do condemnations of the appalling deeds of homicidal thugs not feature far more centrally? Why are they not front and centre, in advance of any attempts at contextualisation or prevarication?
Conversely, in the United States, even politicians who have long espoused a near-slavish fidelity to Israeli hardliners are currently suspect. Addressing a rally on Boston Common, Democratic US Senator Ed Markey, who is a staunch advocate for his government’s funding of Israel,called Hamas “violent extremists”and reiterated that Israel has the backing of the US because of “a bond that will never be broken.”

The assembled crowd of mainly left-of-centre activists, however, disapproved and booed loudly when Senator Markey said that “there must be a de-escalation of the current violence.” At the same rally, the remarks of a congressional colleague and fellow Democrat, US Representative Jake Auchincloss, were cheered wildly when he contradicted Markey and claimed that “now is not the time for equivocation.”
After the gathering, Congressman Auchincloss made a truly chilling admission. His declaration was a “pre-rebuttal to a narrative that I don’t want to build – that both sides need to lay down their arms. And that both sides have equal responsibility.” How could an individual endorsed by the electorate as recently as 2022 oppose the cessation of armed conflict and the pursuit of peace, wherever on the planet it is? And how could one who has earned the voters’ trust be so manifestly ignorant of history?
Far from the cauldron in the Middle East, then, at one end of the spectrum, there are elected officials all too willing to gloss over the slaughter of innocents by Hamas madmen. And at the other, there are elected officials comfortable with condoning illegal and unconscionable wars by Israel.
The outsiders at the two poles of this dispute are similarly wrong, grievously wrong. And the vast majority who together recoil at their dangerous zealotry must not be afraid to say so because of what the misguided in our midst might say about us.

Micheál Martin calls on Israel to rescind its evacuation order for northern Gaza,"TÁNAISTE MICHEÁL MARTIN has called on Israel to rescind its evacuation order from northern Gaza and said that moving 1 million people in that time “simply isn’t feasible”.
This morning Israel ordered theevacuation of 1.1 million people from northern Gaza within 24 hours, something the UN has described as “impossible”.
Speaking in Cork today, Martin said: “In respect of Israel and Gaza, we’ve been very clear that Israel has a right to self defense, but it must be within international law and that there are obligations under the Geneva Convention. And it simply isn’t feasible, that a million people can move out of the city in 24 hours.
“That call by Israel should be rescinded and should be pulled back. Because I think everybody knows it’s not something that can be achieved at all,” the Tánaiste said.
He said the evacuation order “puts enormous trauma on the ordinary civilians and Gazans” and said “two wrongs don’t make a right”.
“There’s an obligation to protect civilians in Gaza, to protect children and families and so forth and people who have nothing to do with Hamas,” he said.
Martin, who is also Minister for Foreign Affairs said he accepts that Israel has a “legitimate right to deal with Hamas because Hamas has waged war on its civilians” but added “it cannot be in the context of an attack on the civilian population of Gaza.”

“Our value system is one that does not in any way, support any collective punishment of an entire population. That’s not acceptable, from our perspective,” he added.
EU response
Martin said he has been “heartened” by the debate had at the European Union’s Foreign Affairs Council meeting earlier this week.
He said there was “a very strong unity of purpose in respect of maintaining development assistance to the Palestinians” and a very strong consensus on the application of international law in respect of any response by Israel in Gaza.
Martin firmly rejected that Ireland is an “anti-semitic country”.
He said: “I don’t believe there’s a majority of commentators who believe that either. I think Ireland has a very, very good reputation globally, in respect of our support for human rights.”
Hamas has rejected Israel’s evacuation order, and in a statement said: “Our Palestinian people reject the threat of the occupation (Israeli) leaders and its call for them to leave their homes and flee from them to the south (of Gaza) or Egypt,” the Islamist militant group said in a statement.
“We are steadfast on our land and in our homes and our cities. There will be no displacement,” it said.
Hamas also says at least 13 Israeli and foreign hostages held in the northern Gaza Strip have been killed in Israeli air strikes in the past 24 hours.

"Israel orders 1.1 million to flee northern Gaza, as UN warns mass relocation 'impossible'","
HAMAS HAS URGED Palestinians to stay in their homes after Israel called for the immediate relocation of 1.1 million people in Gaza.
The UN said the mass relocation of the entire population in northern Gaza to the south of the enclave was “impossible” and urgently appealed for Israel’s order to be rescinded.
Palestinians would only be able to flee south within Gaza as Israel has completely sealed off the territory, a narrow strip of land about 25 miles long.
At least 13 Israeli and foreign hostages held in the northern Gaza Strip have been killed in Israeli air strikes in the past 24 hours, Hamas’s armed wing has said.
“Thirteen prisoners… including foreigners” were killed in five locations targeted by Israeli fighter jets, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement.
The UN said it had been informed of Israel’s evacuation order shortly before midnight, six days after Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and took about 150 hostages in the deadliest attack since the country’s creation in 1948.
Israel has retaliated by raining air and artillery strikes in Gaza for six days, claiming more than 1,400 lives and displacing over 400,000 people in the crowded enclave.
It is preparing for a possible ground invasion of the Palestinian territory after what has been labelled Israel’s 9/11.
The Israel’s Ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, reacted angrily to the UN saying its response to the warning to Gaza residents as “shameful”.
“For many years, the UN has turned a blind eye to the arming of Hamas and its use of the civilian population and civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip as a hiding place for its weapons and murder,” Erdan said in a note from his office to AFP.
Safe passage?
There are 2.4 million people living in Gaza who are now enduring the fifth war in 15 years in the coastal enclave.
Israeli fighter jets and drones have flown above Gaza in a relentless bombardment that has levelled entire blocks and destroyed thousands of buildings.
More than 423,000 people have already fled their homes in Gaza, according to the UN.
Cairo faced calls to allow safe passage for fleeing civilians, but Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi yesterday urged Gazans to “stay steadfast and remain on their land”.
Israel has cut off water, food and power supplies to Gaza in a siege it has vowed will not end until all hostages are freed.
“Humanitarian aid to Gaza? No electric switch will be turned on, no water tap will be opened and no fuel truck will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home,” Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said.
Hamas has threatened to kill hostages if Israel bombs Gaza civilian targets without advance warning.
“I know he’s out there somewhere,” one of the affected Israelis, Ausa Meir, said of her brother Michael, who is among the captives.
“It’s very, very painful.”
US support
The United States has vowed unwavering support for Israel in its war on Hamas.
“You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a joint press conference in Tel Aviv with Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.
“But as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to. We will always be there by your side.”
Netanyahu voiced appreciation for the US support, which includes military aid, and said Hamas, which rules the blockaded Gaza Strip, should be treated like the Islamic State group.
“Just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed. And Hamas should be treated exactly the way ISIS was treated,” Netanyahu said.
Blinken meanwhile stressed that Hamas did not represent the Palestinian people.

“Anyone who wants peace and justice must condemn Hamas’s reign of terror,” Blinken said.
Blinken then travelled to Jordan, where he will meet King Abdullah II and Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas today.
He will also go to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Qatar to put pressure on Hamas and secure the release of hostages.
Hospital morgues
The International Committee of the Red Cross Middle East chief Fabrizio Carboni warned Gaza’s hospitals “risk turning into morgues”.
At the biggest, al-Shifa Hospital, there were chaotic scenes yesterday of an uninterrupted stream of ambulances, relatives asking for news and wails of anguish from relatives of the dead.
An AFP team saw dozens of bodies wrapped in white shrouds in cold storage units and covering the floor of the mortuary.
In his first public remarks since Hamas attacked Israel, Palestinian president Abbas called for an “immediate end to comprehensive aggression against the Palestinian people”.
The UN humanitarian agency has launched an urgent appeal for nearly $300 million (€284m) to address the most urgent needs in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
‘Depravity’
Netanyahu’s account on X, formerly Twitter, said he showed Blinken “photos of babies murdered and burned by the Hamas monsters”.
Blinken told reporters later the images were “new evidence of depravity and the inhumanity of Hamas”.
But Hamas denied its fighters killed infants during the assault on Saturday.
Political bureau member Ezzat al-Rishaq called it a “fake and false Israeli narrative”, insisting “no evidence has been submitted to support such false claims”.
Military build-up
Israel has called up 300,000 reservists and rushed forces, tanks and heavy armour to the southern desert areas around Gaza from where Hamas fighters launched their unprecedented attack on October 7.
Israeli soldiers have since then swept the southern towns and kibbutz communities and killed 1,500 of the militants, while making ever more shocking discoveries of large numbers of dead civilians.
“It looks like … an atomic bomb just landed here,” Doron Spielman, an Israeli army spokesman, said at one gated community where more than 100 residents were killed.
Hezbollah threat
Israel’s war now flaring in the south is further complicated by a threat from the north, the Iran-backed Hezbollah group based in Lebanon.
The army has massed tanks on the border after repeated clashes with Hezbollah in recent days, including cross-border rockets and shelling.
The United States has sent munitions to Israel and deployed an aircraft carrier battle group to the eastern Mediterranean in a show of support, while warning Israel’s other enemies not to enter the conflict.
In London, the UK said it was sending two Royal Navy ships and surveillance aircraft to the eastern Mediterranean to support Israel, as well as “ensure regional stability and prevent further escalation”.
Israel’s arch foe Iran has long financially and militarily backed Hamas and praised its attack, but insists it was not involved.
Iran’s ultra-conservative President Ebrahim Raisi called on Islamic and Arab countries to confront Israel and support the “oppressed Palestinian nation”, in a phone call with his Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad.
Israel also struck Syria’s two main airports, in Damascus and Aleppo, in “simultaneous” attacks on landing strips that put them out of service”, state media said, citing an unidentified military source.

Funeral of 22-year-old Irish-Israeli woman Kim Damti takes place,"THE FUNERAL OF 22-year-old Irish-Israeli woman Kim Damti, who died after Hamas militants launched an unprecedented series of surprise attacks on Saturday, has taken place in Israel.
Kim Damti had remained unaccounted, having been attending a music festival when Hamas carried out a bloody mass-shooting on the event, which was attended by hundreds of young Israelis and foreigners near Kibbutz Reim, close to Gaza.
Tánaiste Micheál Martin confirmed her death in a statement yesterday evening.
Speaking to RTÉ’s Prime Time this evening, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar paid tribute to Kim Damti.
“I just think we’re all really shocked at what happened,” Varadkar said.
“I heard her mother talking about how she didn’t bring her daughter up to hate anyone and just the thought of anyone having their life ended in the way it was, it’s really sad and the nation is mourning,” he said.
RTÉreported that Irish Ambassador to Israel Sonya McGuinness told Kim Damti’s funeral that Ireland is “appalled at the loss of this beautiful young woman”.
“She was the best of your community and the best of our community and the best of who we are as a shared people,” McGuinness told mourners.
“Our sincere condolences to you and your entire community and Kim’s friends and families. We stand with you.”

In a statement to RTÉ News, Kim Damti’s aunt Pat Cooper said the family “thanks all those who have supported us with love and encouragement over the past five days”.
“We respectfully request the media to allow us to grieve in the privacy of our family.”
In his statement last night, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said: “When news reached us over the weekend that an Irish citizen was one of the many hundreds missing after the repugnant terrorist attack by Hamas in Israel, we hoped against hope that she would be found safely. The news that this hope has now been extinguished is devastating”.
“Anyone looking at the photo of Kim in the media over the last few days will have been struck by the radiance and energy in her expression; a young 22 year old woman with a whole life ahead of her, full of promise.
“For anyone to lose a child is devastating. To lose a child in such circumstances is indescribable,” the Tánaiste said.
He added: “On my behalf and on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland, I convey our heartfelt condolences to Kim’s family in Ireland and in Israel. We are with them in their grief. I spoke with Kim’s family earlier this evening and expressed this to them.”
President Michael D Higgins said he has heard of Kim Damti’s death with the “greatest sadness”
“The circumstances in which her life was taken, having travelled as she did to attend a music festival, are truly appalling,” Higgins said.
“Kim’s death once again reminds us what an outrageous breach of fundamental international law in conditions of conflict it is to target civilians in this way,” he said.
“May I send my deepest condolences to Kim’s family, friends and all those with whom she shared her life. Suaimhneas síoraí dá hanam.”

Varadkar: Israel is 'under threat' but 'doesn't have right' to breach international law,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said “Israel is under threat” but criticised it for cutting off water and electricity to the Gaza Strip, deeming the actions “not acceptable”.
Hamas gunmen killed 1,200 people in Israel and took about 150 hostages in their surprise onslaught launched from Gaza on Saturday.
Israel has retaliated by raining air and artillery strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza for six days, claiming more than 1,400 lives.
Speaking to RTÉ’s Prime Time this evening, Varadkar said that Israel has a “right to defend themselves, but they don’t a right to breach international humanitarian law”.
“Israel is a country that is surrounded by these brutal, savage groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, countries like Iran, often supported by Islamic fundamentalists and anti-Semites around the world, so Israel is under threat” he said.

Fears have grown for Gaza’s 2.4 million people now enduring the fifth war in 15 years in the coastal enclave, which has also seen Israel cut off water, food and power supplies.
Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz has vowed the siege would remain in force until the hostages are freed.
“Humanitarian aid to Gaza? No electric switch will be turned on, no water tap will be opened and no fuel truck will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home,” he said.
Speaking to Prime Time, Varadkar said he is “really concerned” about what he is “seeing happening in Gaza at the moment”.
“To me, it amounts to collective punishment. Cutting off power, cutting off fuel supplies and water supplies, that’s not that way a respectable democratic state should conduct itself,” he added.
Varadkar said Hamas should “release all of the hostages immediately, Israeli citizens and dual citizens alike”.
“Israel is entirely justified in going after Hamas, in Gaza and elsewhere, but operations that clearly affect civilians disproportionately are wrong, cutting off electricity, cutting off water, that’s not acceptable,” the Taoiseach said.
Varadkar also expressed his condolences to the family of Irish-Israeli woman Kim Damti whowas confirmed dead yesterday.
22-year-old Kim Damti had been missing since Hamas militants launched an unprecedented series of surprise attacks on Saturday. She had attended the music festival when Hamas carried out a bloody mass-shooting on the event.
Her funeral was held today in Israel,RTÉhas reported.
Also speaking to RTÉ’s Prime Time was the Iraeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich.

She said: “Right now, we are at war. It’s a war that we didn’t choose, we didn’t start, but we need to make sure that our borders are secure, that our people are safe. Our people are not safe yet.
“We will do everything that we can in order to make our people safe.”
When asked what innocent cilivians in Gaza do to protect themselves from attacks, Erlich said she “would like to direct that question to Hamas”.
“They’ve been planning this attack for so long. They’re stockpiling for so long. They’ve been wielding terror tunnels for so long. If only they would have invested that money in stockpiling food for their people or water for the people. Why didn’t they take care of their people?” she said.

Erlich was asked what the rationale is for denying civilians who are being bombed the right to leave, the right to food, water and medicine.
She responded: “Right now we are at war. When you’re at war, you will do everything in your power to make sure that your people are safe. Talking about opening a border, our border was just infiltrated in order to butcher our people.
“And you’ve heard those stories. You cannot stay indifferent to these stories. I don’t want to believe that there’s anyone in Ireland that is indifferent to these stories, and do not fully condemn all of it.”
During his interview, Varadkar called for the humanitarian corridor between Egypt and Gaza to be immediately reopened.
The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza is the only passage in and out of the coastal enclave not controlled by Israel.
Varadkar comments come as Eygpt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi today said his country is committed to ensuring the delivery “of aid, both medical and humanitarian at this difficult time”, affirming Cairo’s “firm position” of ensuring Palestinians’ “legitimate rights”.
However, he stressed that Gazans must “stay steadfast and remain on their land”.
Egypt, historically a key intermediary between Hamas and Israel, has called for donors to send humanitarian aid bound for Gaza to El Arish airport but has pushed against calls to allow fleeing Palestinians into its land.
Egypt has pushed for a diplomatic solution and called for restraint from both sides, while Sisi has asserted his country’s national security was his “primary responsibility”.
Today, al-Sisi said that Egypt was already hosting “nine million guests, as I call them, from many countries who came to Egypt for security and safety”.
But the case of Gazans “is different”, he said, because their displacement would mean “the elimination of the (Palestinian) cause”.
Egypt was the first Arab state to normalise relations with Israel in 1979, after a six-year war that ended in 1973 with Egypt regaining the Sinai Peninsula from Israeli control.

As It Happened: Israeli lawmakers endorse 'emergency government'; US has no plans to deploy troops,"LAST UPDATE|12 Oct 2023
AT LEAST 150 Israelis and foreigners – including soldiers, civilians, children and women – have been held hostage in the Gaza Strip since Hamas’s attack on Israel on Saturday.
The Israeli military said more than 1,300 people, including 189 soldiers, have been killed in Israel.
In Gaza, over 1,300 people have also been killed, according to authorities there.
Palestine’s electricity authority has said Gaza’s only power plant has run out of fuel, while Israeli authorities have closed down the city’s borders to supplies.
Israel has said its siege of Gaza will not end until the hostages being detained are freed.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken today vowed that the United States will “always” back Israel, but said the Palestinians also have “legitimate aspirations” not represented by Hamas.
Meanwhile, former Irish president Mary Robinson has condemned “war crimes” by both Israel and Hamas.
Here are the latest developments as they happened today:
12 Oct 20239:39AMDozens of foreigners have been killed, taken hostage or wounded during the surprise attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Others remain missing.22-year-old Kim Damti, an Irish-Israeli woman who has been missing since the Hamas attacks on Saturday, has been confirmed dead.Several countries have launched operations to repatriate their citizens, while others plan to do so in the coming days.12 Oct 20239:42AMNATO countries have told Israel’s defence minister they stood by his country after the attack by Hamas, but urged his forces to respond with “proportionality”.In Gaza, officials have reported more than 1,200 people killed in Israel’s uninterrupted campaign of air and artillery strikes, while the UN said more than 338,000 people have been displaced.US President Joe Biden – who has strongly backed Israel and started sending military aid – has cautioned that Israel must, despite “all the anger and frustration … operate by the rules of war”.12 Oct 20239:49AMThe Israeli army has said it was preparing for a ground assault on Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip but that the country’s political leaders had not yet taken a decision.“We are waiting to see what our political leadership decides about a potential ground” incursion, army spokesperson Richard Hecht told journalists.“This has not been decided yet… But we are preparing for a ground manoeuvre if it is decided,” he added.12 Oct 20239:51AMDozens of the United Nations’ independent experts have this morning condemned Hamas’s “horrific crimes” and said Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip “amounts to collective punishment”.“There is no justification for violence that indiscriminately targets innocent civilians, whether by Hamas or Israeli forces. This is absolutely prohibited under international law and amounts to a war crime,” the experts, who are mandated by the UN but do not speak on its behalf, said in a joint statement.12 Oct 202310:07AMIsrael prepares ground offenceHere’s more of what we know about Israel’s preparations for a possible ground offence against Gaza:The Israeli army has already deployed tens of thousands of troops to the border with the Gaza Strip. So far, its air strikes have targeted Hamas infrastructure but have also injured and killed civilians.Army spokesperson Richard Hecht said Israel is now “preparing ourselves for the next stages of war”, which includes “multiple operative contingency plans”.While decisions are made about whether to initiate a ground manoeuvre, the next possible operation “could be from the air” or “could be combined from the sea (and) air”.12 Oct 202310:20AMPhoto:Four paramedics were killed in Gaza in an air strike yesterday, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.Ramez Habboub / Abaca Press/Alamy Live NewsRamez Habboub / Abaca Press/Alamy Live News / Abaca Press/Alamy Live News12 Oct 202310:41AM'Unmanageable' humanitarian situationFabrizio Carboni, a senior official at the International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip will become “unmanageable very quickly”.12 Oct 202310:53AMElon Musk and disinformationYou may remember that on Tuesday, the EUwarned Elon Musk that his platform X, formerly Twitter, is spreading “illegal content and disinformation” about the conflict.X has now responded to say that it had taken down or labelled “tens of thousands” of posts in the days after the Hamas attack on Israel.“Since the terrorist attack on Israel, we have taken action to remove or label tens of thousands of pieces of content,” the firm’s CEO Linda Yaccarino has written in a letter.12 Oct 202311:01AMStaying with the letter sent by X, formerly Twitter, to the European Commission today,  here’s some more of what we know.Today’s letter was addressed to EU internal market commissioner Thierry Breton, who had personally criticised Musk on social media on Tuesday, sparking a public clash between the two.Breton, the EU’s self-styled “digital enforcer”, raised the alarm in letters sent to Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, whose Meta group includes Facebook and Instagram.His requested that each of them provide details within 24 hours on how “illegal content and disinformation” is being removed from their platforms in line with the EU’s new Digital Service Act (DSA).The legislation came into effect for large platforms in August and bans illegal online content, with heavy fines for non-compliance.Breton’s letter to Musk highlighted “violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform” following Hamas’s weekend operation to kill and take hostage Israelis living close to the boundary with Gaza.Yaccarino’s response letter, published on a corporate X account and reposted by the CEO, said the firm had removed hundreds of accounts linked to the Gaza militant organisation Hamas since violence erupted on Saturday.It had also taken down posts that involved “violent speech, manipulated media and graphic media”.Everyday we're reminded of our global responsibility to protect the public conversation by ensuring everyone has access to real-time information and safeguarding the platform for all our users.

Even the most seemingly intractable conflicts can be resolved but it requires dialogue, it requires a process and that has been lacking for some years in the Middle East,” Donaldson said.“We haven’t had a proper process, a proper dialogue, and that is something which needs to be given priority now by the international community,” he said.“I don’t think we can just stand by and say the violence is wrong – it is, but we need to help Israel and the Palestinians to get to a point where they are sitting across a table and trying to resolve their differences. That will require an end to the violence.”Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo12 Oct 202311:53AMUS President Joe Biden spoke last night about seeing “confirmed pictures” of Hamas terrorists beheading children and babies, a story which has been widely shared in recent days. His comments appeared to confirm that the US had verified that the horrific incident had taken place. However, afterwards, a White House spokesperson said that the US had yet to to get independent verification.“I’ve been doing this a long time,” Biden said in remarks about US support for Israel, shortly before 10pm last night Irish time. “I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children.”In response to a question from a reporter from The Washington Post, a spokesperson for the White House said that Biden’s comments were based on media reports and claims by Benjamin Netanyahu, and that US officials have not seen pictures or confirmed the reports independently.It was a confusing intervention from Biden on a hugely sensitive issue. It also highlights the fog of war – and the difficulty in getting accurate, verified information from a warzone.Alamy Live NewsAlamy Live News12 Oct 202312:14PMHostagesThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is in contact with Hamas and Israel to try to facilitate the release of hostages taken into Gaza.The ICRC can not negotiate over hostage exchanges as it is not its role as a humanitarian organisation, according to its regional director Fabrizio Carboni.However, it is in daily communication with Hamas.“As a neutral intermediary we stand ready to conduct humanitarian visits; facilitate communication between hostages and family members; and to facilitate any eventual release,” Carboni said today.He declined to go into details as to whether the organisation knew the whereabouts of those being held, respecting the ICRC’s tradition of discretion.“We’ve called on all parties who have an influence on this case, and especially Hamas, to treat people humanely, respect their dignity, allow them to contact their family and inform them about their situation,” he said.“We should be allowed to visit them.“There are many people who shouldn’t be detained and captured and who need to be released.”12 Oct 202312:58PMDuring leaders questions, Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns says she’s “deeply concerned” about the European Union’s response to Israel’s attacks on Gaza.Cairns said: “Civilians are being deliberately slaughtered. And the international community can’t muster up a single word of criticism for the Israeli government.”When Israel drops its bombs, civilians have nowhere to run.”“Now they don’t have food, water, or electricity. Soon, the internet will also die, and they will be completely cut off from the world. The people of Gaza have days, a week at most.”She asks Tánaiste Micheál Martin if he too is concerned regarded the EU’s response.Responding, Martin says the the response of Commissioner Varhelyi, does not reflect the EU’s response.Earlier this week, Varhelyi announced on X, formerly Twitter, that the EU would be revoking all aid to Palestine,a move that was quickly shot down and reversed by the EU.Martin claims that the EU’s Foreign Affairs Council made it clear that humanitarian and development aid to Palestinians would continue,when he met with them on Tuesday.“Ultimately, we need to move on a pathway to peace and reconciliation,” the Tánaiste said.It cannot be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth approach.”Pushing the Tánaiste on whether he shares her concerns, Cairns asked if the Tánaiste what is he doing on an EU level to “work towards intervention”.Cairns said she is deeply concerned about the EU's response to attacks on Gaza.Oireachtas TV / The JournalOireachtas TV / The Journal / The Journal“We can play a powerful role, I think, as a neutral arbiter – if we’re willing to act, to lead, and to do so quickly,” she said.Cairns directly asked Martin for his “position on the EU response”.“I don’t accept your assessment of the EU response,” the Tánaiste said.One of the biggest donors to Palestine is the European Union. So let’s not present the EU as somehow a body that’s out to undermine Palestinians.”However, the Tánaiste said that International law and the Geneva Convention “must be adhered to” adding that the “vast majority of member states are very clear,- are very, very clear – in terms of continuing developmental aid and humanitarian aid”.“But also, insuring that any [attacks] have to be in accordance with international law,” he added.12 Oct 20231:00PMUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed on a visit to Israel today that the United States will “always” back Israel, but said the Palestinians also have “legitimate aspirations” not represented by militant group Hamas.“You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself,” Blinken said during a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, AFP reports.“But as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to. We will always be there by your side.”Paying a solidarity visit as Israel’s army hammers Hamas over weekend attacks that killed 1,200 people in Israel, Blinken also gave a new death toll for US citizens, saying at least 25 were confirmed among the dead.US President Joe Biden earlier vowed unwavering support for Israel and not called for restraint against Hamas, but Blinken hinted at the need for an eventual peace settlement — an idea that has long met resistance from the right-wing Netanyahu.“Anyone who wants peace and justice must condemn Hamas’ reign of terror. We know Hamas doesn’t represent the Palestinian people, or their legitimate aspirations to live with equal measures of security, freedom, justice opportunity and dignity,” Blinken said.Speaking in unusually personal terms, Blinken recalled how his grandfather fled anti-Semitic pogroms in Russia and his stepfather survived Nazi concentration camps.“I come before you not only as the United States secretary of state but also as a Jew,” Blinken, who has a secular background, said.“I also come before you as a husband and father of young children. It’s impossible for me to look at the photos of families killed, such as the mother, father and three small children murdered as they sheltered in their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, and not think of my own children.”Blinken promised that the Biden administration and Congress would work together to meet military requests for Israel, which enjoys wide support across party lines.“As Israel’s defence needs evolve, we will work with Congress to make sure that they’re met,” he said.Netanyahu, speaking next to Blinken, voiced appreciation for US support and said that Hamas, which rules the blockaded Gaza Strip, should be treated like the Islamic State group.“Just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed. And Hamas should be treated exactly the way ISIS was treated,” Netanyahu said.12 Oct 20231:28PMMichael Kelly, editor of the Irish Catholic, has confirmed that a group of Irish pilgrims who were visiting Israel when the war broke out are on their way back to Ireland.Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport is busy, but moving.

It does not justify the horrific killings and the kidnappings – which are war crimes – and we must be very, very clear on that. We must not be ambivalent, there is no question, we have to treat them separately,” she said.12 Oct 20232:02PMLebanon-Israel conflict riskThe United Nations’ mission in Lebanon is trying to prevent an outright confrontation between Lebanon and Israel.The UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander Aroldo Lázaro has said that “despite concerning events in the past days, the situation in UNIFIL’s area of operations remains stable, but volatile”.UN peacekeepers “remain in their positions and on task”.“We have increased patrols and other activities to maintain stability, coordinating this work with the Lebanese Armed Forces,” Lázaro said.“We have actively engaged with authorities on both sides of the Blue Line to de-escalate the situation and avoid misunderstandings.“Our main goal is to help avoid confrontation between Lebanon and Israel, and any event that brings conflict closer is a concern.

There is no place to hide, no time to rest. Some places are being bombed on consecutive nights,” Kennes said.“Each time our medical colleagues go to work, not knowing if they will see their homes or their families again.“This time, after five days, there have already been 1,200 deaths.

What's known about the claim that 40 babies were beheaded by Hamas in Israel?,"IN RECENT DAYS, reports have circulated widely – on WhatsApp, social media, in newspapers, and even by US President Joe Biden – that Hamas militants beheaded dozens of babies in an attack on the Kfar Aza kibbutz in southern Israel.
If true, it would constitute one of the most horrific war crimes in an already-brutal conflict between Israel and Hamas that is not even a week old.
At present, there is no way to independently verify that it happened: no authority, including the Israeli government or the country’s military, have officially confirmed or denied the reports. This does not necessarily mean that the beheadings didn’t happen, just that it can’t be said with certainty that they did.
This has not stopped the claim from being reported in the media and going viral in online spaces that areawash with misinformationabout the conflict, such as old videos from other conflicts being re-shared or false reports about the actions of both sides.
In those online spaces, the claim has surfaced alongside opinions about the situation in Gaza which are highly charged (in partbecause of the complex and intractable natureof the overall Israel-Palestine conflict).
All of this makes it harder to tell what is and isn’t true about the alleged beheadings, and obscures the actual facts – including that small childrenwerekilled by Hamas in the attack on Kfar Aza kibbutz.
Here’s what we do know about the claim and where it came from.
The Kfar Aza kibbutz, a communal village in southern Israel about 2km from the border with Gaza, was home to around 400 people before Hamas attacked last Saturday.
Its proximity to the Palestinian territory meant that it was one of the first places hit by militants, who struck at around 6.30am local time on Saturday morning, the Jewish sabbath.
Cars and homes were set ablaze and retired Israeli major general Itai Veruv said 70 Palestinian gunmen took part in the raid.
No official death toll has been provided but multiple soldiers told reporters on the ground that militants killed least 100 people – including an undetermined number of children and babies.
It took more than 12 hours for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) to respond with help and days for them regain control full of the kibbutz, with fighting reportedly continuing up to Tuesday morning.

Domestic and international media were invited to the kibbutz from later on Tuesday, and reports of decapitations of some of those who had been killed soon emerged.
One report by the BBC’s International Editor Jeremy Bowenquoted Davidi Ben Zion, the deputy commander of the IDF paratrooper unit who re-took control of the kibbutz, as mentioning a number of decapitations. The commander did not specifically mention children in the quotes he gave to the veteran BBC journalist.
“They killed them and cut some of their heads, it’s a dreadful thing to see… and we must remember who is the enemy, and what our mission is, [for] justice where there is a right side and all the world needs to be behind us,” Ben Zion is reported to have said.
Later on Tuesday, another report about beheadings in Kfar Aza emerged from i24News, a 24-hour Israeli news channel.
A three-minute video clip from a report by journalist Nicole Zedeck in Kfar Azawas shared on the station’s feed on X, formerly Twitter, during which she made the claim that babies in the kibbutz had been decapitated by Hamas.
“I’m talking to some of the [IDF] soldiers and they say what they’ve witnessed as they’ve been walking through these different houses, these different communities… babies [with] their heads cut off,” she said.

The post on i24News’ profile has currently been viewed more than 11 million times.
In a subsequent tweet quoting the video, Zedeck also mentioned that a specific number of children had been killed, though she did not say they were beheaded.
“Soldiers told me they believe 40 babies/children were killed. The exact death toll is still unknown as the military continues to go house to house and find more Israeli casualties,” she wrote.

In another video, she also described “40 babies at least” being “taken out on gurneys”, although once again, she did not say that these babies had been beheaded.
And in yet another video, Zedeck was filmed speaking to David Ben Zion, the deputy commander of the paratrooper unit, who also said that Hamas “cut off heads [...] of children, of women”.
Around two hours after the original i24News video was posted,it was re-sharedby the official @Israel account on X with the caption “40 babies murdered” (a figure that was not mentioned by Zedeck in the report).
That post has currently been seen more than 18 million times.
Asked about the number of babies killed at Kfar Aza, the Israeli foreign ministry, which runs the @Israel account on X, has told multiple outlets: “We cannot confirm any number at this stage.”
After the posted by the @Israel account, the claim was quickly re-shared online, in domestic and international media and by Israeli officials.
As the claim initially spread, the exact number of people beheaded was also reported in different ways.
In an interview on Sky News on Tuesday evening, Israeli economy minister Nir Barkat made an indirect reference to the claim, mentioning that 40 boys had been killed and that some of them had been decapitated.
“We’ve seen just now… we’ve heard of 40 young boys. Some of them were burned alive. Some were beheaded. Some were shot in the head,” he said.
The next morning, when the claim featured in several UK newspapers, includingThe Independentand the front pages ofThe Timesand theDaily Mail, the latter of which reported that an unspecified number of babies had been beheaded and that 40 children had been shot.

The claim has also been indirectly attributed in different ways, with some who originally said that children had been beheaded subsequently clarifying their remarks.
In a statement on Tuesday evening, the IDF initially said that beheadings had occurred but would not confirm a number.
The force indirectly suggested children had been beheaded by alluding to the Islamic State, which became notorious during the last decade for releasing videos of their militants decapitating hostages.
“We cannot confirm any numbers period. What happened in Kibbutz Kfar Azza is a massacre in which women, children, toddlers and elderly were brutally butchered in an ISIS way of action,”a spokesperson saidin a statement circulated to multiple outlets.
However, the latest IDF statement has said that reports of beheadings are currently “unconfirmed”.
The following day, the Israeli Government appeared to confirm the claim.

Its spokesperson Tal Heinrich told London-based radio station LBC and said that “toddlers [and] other babies, some of them with their heads cut off” had been found at Kfar Aza.
Heinrich later clarified that her statement was based solely on the testimony of soldiers.Another government spokesperson then told CNN on Thursdaythat although beheadings had occurred, it could not confirm if this had involved children.
US President Joe Biden also suggested that he had seen pictures of beheaded children during a meeting with Jewish leaders at the White House on Wednesday night.
“I never really thought that I would see, have confirmed, pictures of terrorists beheading children,” he said.
However,a White House spokesperson later confirmedthat neither Biden nor any other US officials had seen pictures of beheadings or confirmed reports independently, and that the president’s comments were based on news reports and claims by the Israeli government.
On Thursday afternoon,the Jerusalem Postreported that it had verified photos showing that children in the kibbutz had been burned and decapitated.
It said the photos had been shown to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken before being shared on the official X account of the Prime Minister of Israel.
The account has posted extremely graphic photos of dead children, which it said were shown to Blinken, and also compared Hamas to the Islamic State group.
However, the caption accompanying the post makes no reference to babies who were beheaded. The Jerusalem Post did not explain how it had verified the images.
Children are among those to have been killed at the Kvar Aza kibbutz during the attack by Hamas militants on Saturday.
Violence against civilians, including children, isprohibited during armed conflictunder international law, and armed forces are required to take measures to protect civilians.
To date, no reports of decapitated children have been officially confirmed.
Various reports suggest that some beheadings took place in the kibbutz, a claim repeated by the IDF in its statement to CNN on Thursday.
“There have been cases of Hamas militants carrying out beheadings and other ISIS-style atrocities. However, we cannot confirm if the victims were men or women, soldiers or civilians, adults or children,”an official is quoted as saying.
Numerous journalists visited the kibbutz for a tour on Tuesday, though none seem to have confirmed reports of beheadings themselves.
Oren Ziv, a reporter with the independent 972 Magazine in Israel, posted a thread to X on Wednesdaysaying that he did not see any evidenceduring the tour.
Sky News reporter Stuart Ramseylikewise said thatthe subject of beheaded children did not feature in interviews he conducted with two IDF majors at the scene. Ramsay said if he believed that babies had been beheaded, he and other reporters would have been told.
Hamas has denied the allegations, which remain unproven at the time of writing.

Robinson says Israel in 'serious breach' of international law and there's been 'war crimes' on both sides,"FORMER PRESIDENT MARY Robinson has said Israel is in “serious breach” of international law with its “indiscriminate” bombings of Gaza.
The death toll in the Gaza Strip hasexceeded 1,300 people. Local authorities say those who died were predominantly civilians.
In response to a number of violent attacks carried out by Palestinian militant group Hamas over the weekend, Israeli Defence Forces begana major bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on Monday.
Speaking on RTÉ Radio One’s ‘News At One’ programme this afternoon, Robinson condemned what she described as “war crimes” carried out by both Israel and Hamas in the last few days.
Robinson, who is also a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said she had previously been told about Israel “committing the crime of apartheid” in the West Bank region and Gaza Strip.
She added: “I have listened to the mother of Kim Damti wondering about her daughter. She is now found that her daughter, aged 22, died at a party.
“These are very serious war crimes.
“They are not justified by what has been happening to the Palestinian people under occupation,” she added.
She said: “It does not justify the horrific killings, and the kidnappings, which are war crimes, and we must be very, very clear on that
Robinson, who is a founding member of The Elders group of world leaders, became emotional when discussing the death of Kim Damti, an Irish-Israeli woman who died on Saturday after Hamas attacked a music festival she was attending.
Her death was confirmed last night.
“Already, sadly, Israel is in serious breach of its obligations. It is carrying out a massive, indiscriminate bombing of Gaza,” she said.
Nearly 190,000 people have been displaced in Gaza since the escalation of the conflict, according to the United Nations. The true extent of the death toll and injuries in the region remains unknown.

Water, food, fuel and electricity has also been cut off to the compact home to 2.3 million Palestinian people – one of the most densely populated areas in the world.
“This is collective punishment against a whole population, many of whom don’t support or don’t like Hamas,” Robinson said.
Robison said that “safe havens” for civilians should be created, suggesting a better focus from the international community should be placed on protecting human lives.
She also welcomed the continuation of humanitarian aid from the EU.
Earlier this week, EU Commissioner Varhelyi announced on X, formerly Twitter, that the EU would be revoking all aid to Palestine,a move that was quickly shot down and reversed by the EU.
Speaking during Leaders Questions earlier today, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said that the EU’s Foreign Affairs Council made it clear that humanitarian and development aid to Palestinians would continue,when he met with them on Tuesday.
“Ultimately, we need to move on a pathway to peace and reconciliation,” the Tánaiste said.

He added that response of Commissioner Varhelyi, does not reflect the EU’s response.
Robinson made a similar call this afternoon on RTÉ and said that Ireland can play an “important role” in the steps to resolve this current period of unrest in the region.
“I’m aware that Ireland has already been a very good voice in acknowledging the suffering of occupation, the continual problems for the Palestinians over decades, over 17 years of a blockade now on Gaza, and the continuing settlements in the Middle East which are making a two-state solution virtually impossible now,” she said.
“I think we all need to think about accountability,” she added.
“The point I want to get across – and Ireland may be able to play a role here – unfortunately, because Israel doesn’t want to be accountable, the United States has not supported the International Criminal Court in relation to Israel.
“It does in relation to Ukraine, but not Israel – and Western countries have been, to say the least, ambivalent and have not supported.

Earlier in the Dáil, Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns says she is “deeply concerned” about European Union’s response to Israel’s attacks on Gaza.
Cairns said: “Civilians are being deliberately slaughtered. And the international community can’t muster up a single word of criticism for the Israeli government.”
“Now they don’t have food, water, or electricity. Soon, the internet will also die, and they will be completely cut off from the world. The people of Gaza have days, a week at most.”

“We can play a powerful role, I think, as a neutral arbiter – if we’re willing to act, to lead, and to do so quickly,” she said.
Cairns directly asked Micheál Martin for his “position on the EU response”.
“I don’t accept your assessment of the EU response,” the Tánaiste said.
However, the Tánaiste said that International law and the Geneva Convention “must be adhered to” adding that the “vast majority of member states are very clear,- are very, very clear – in terms of continuing developmental aid and humanitarian aid”.
Yesterday in the Dáil, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar reasserted his stance that Israel could lose the support of the international community if its counter-offensive continued to target civilian infrastructure.
The Taoiseach drew a comparison with Vladimir Putin’s assaults on power stations in Ukraine to the Israeli bombings yesterday.
On Tuesday, he told RTÉ’s Nine O’Clock News that Ireland recognised Israel’s right to defend themselves, but warned the state that “any response must be proportionate“.

"How X, formerly Twitter, is platforming a deluge of misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war","
FIGHTING BETWEEN ISRAEL and Hamas around the Gaza border has been the subject of huge volumes of online misinformation, including some claims involving Ireland.
The most recent wave of violence began on Saturday when Palestinian militants launched a surprise attack on Israeli civilians, prompting Israel to declare war on Hamas, the Islamist military group that controls Gaza — a strip of land about one third the area of Longford with a population of more than two million, which has been under Israeli blockade for more than 15 years.
Experts investigating misinformation about the conflict have singled out X, formerly known as Twitter, as a major social media platform where misinformation on Israel-Gaza is being allowed to spread.
Part of the criticism focused on the company’s owner, Elon Musk, recommending that people follow an anti-Semitic account with a history of spreading false claims for updates on the conflict, days after the companyhad made claimsabout the progress it was “making in combating antisemitism on X”.
The EU this weekwarnedElon Musk that his platform is spreading “illegal content and disinformation”.
The Journal FactCheckwas readily able to find posts spreading false claims on that platform, which had accumulated millions of views and which had remained on the platform long after their claims had been debunked.
Often, these involve using image and videos from other conflicts, often in different countries, and claiming they show current events.
Elon Musk has claimed to have laid off most of Twitter’s staff since taking over the company, including cuts to those working on Trust and Safety efforts.
The social media platform instead appears to be relying on Community Notes, a scheme where contributors can submit comments on misleading tweets.
In theory, if enough users can rate these notes as “helpful”, they are shown alongside the original tweet. However, the application of this scheme is inconsistent, with different notes appearing alongside identical posts.
One post featured a video of children in cages, with the description: “SAVAGE ANIMALS Hamas Terrorists. They have kept Kidnapped Israeli children in cages. These BARBARIAN SCUM NEED TO BE ELIMINATED FROM FACE OF THE EARTH”.
However, the video actually predates Hamas’s Saturday attack on Israel.
The post remained on the site more than 48 hours and, at the time of writing, had accumulated more than 2,100,000 views. No Comunity Note to indicate that it was inaccurate appeared alongside it.
Other versions of this video and claim had also accumulated huge views on the platform, however some of these were accompanied by various Community Notes.
One post by Donald Trump Jr., the son of the former president, supposedly featuring a video of atrocities carried out by Palestinian militants, had been accompanied by a Community Note saying the video was old.
Now, it comes accompanied with a Community Note saying that a previous Community Note was misinformation.
The Journalhas also found examples of posts on X that appear to be calling for genocide. “I want nothing less than disemboweled bodies in the Gaza strip and people driven into the sea never to return,” one such post read.
X could not be contacted for comment.
In the days since fighting began, misinformation and disinformation has appeared on X purporting to be evidence of actions by both Hamas and the Israeli forces.
These include video game clips being passed off ascombat footage, years-old videos of attacks,military demonstrations, orfirework displaysfrom other countries being shared with descriptions that they show combat in Gaza; fake accounts formedia organisationsand journalists being used to spread misinformation; a doctored memo from the White House appearing to promise $8 billion military aid to Israel; and videos of babies said to showkidnapping victims.
These claims were often spread by users with paid-for blue ticks next to their name, which had in the previous iteration of X signaled that an account was verified.

Many researchers and journalists have complained that this change has made it significantly harder to find trustworthy sources of information on the conflict.
In comparison, the misinformation featuring Ireland is less extreme.
One video, which has been viewed tens of thousands of times on Facebook and hundreds of thousands of times on X (these numbers are calculated differently on different platforms and may not be comparable), shows hundreds of fans waving the Palestinian flag at a football match.
“Football fans in Ireland raise the flag of Palestine in the stadium during a match to show solidarity with Palestine,” one of the posts that suggest it shows events in Ireland says.
Screenshot from social media video
However, the video was actually filmed in Morocco, between a local team and the Palestinian National football team (the same flags and display screen featured in the clip can be seen inthis video).
Another, more serious claim that has been repeated is that Ireland had refused to condemn Hamas as terrorists.
“The EU wanted to issue a harsher statement but Luxembourg, Ireland and Denmark refused to call Hamas a terror organization,” i24NEWS reported on X, citing an unnamed diplomatic source.
The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said this claim was untrue, and a sourcetoldThe Journalthat, in reality, Ireland had called for a statement that asked for a de-escalation of hostilities on both sides.
The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has similarly dismissed the claim.
“[Denmark] firmly rejects the false information that Denmark should have objected to qualifying Hamas a terrorist organisation in negotiating an EU declaration. Denmark would never do that. Hamas is listed a terror organisation by the EU and Denmark has on several occasions referred to Hamas as such,” it said.
Luxembourg has also denied the claims.
The statement released this week said that the EU “condemns in the strongest possible terms the multiple and indiscriminate attacks across Israel by Hamas and deeply deplores the loss of lives.
“The EU calls for an immediate cessation of these senseless attacks and violence, which will only further increase tensions on the ground and seriously undermine Palestinian people’s aspirations for peace.
A similar claim that has been viewed more than a million times says that the EU had announced a plan to block aid to Palestine, which Ireland then forced them to reverse.
“The EU’s plan to suspend all financial aid to the Palestinian Authority has been blocked by 4 EU states: Ireland, Spain, Denmark and Luxembourg,” one tweet that was viewed more than 833,800 times read.
This narrative mirrors real events. However, official statements suggest this telling gives Ireland a more dramatic role than it may have actually played.
The plan to suspend aid to Palestine was announced by commissioner for Neighbourhood and Engagement, Oliver Varhelyi, acontroversialappointee of Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán.
The move was criticised by the Irish government, which said “there is no legal basis for a unilateral decision of this kind by an individual Commissioner”.
However, this decision wasquickly contradictedby the European Commision, which said, “as there were no payments foreseen, there will be no suspension of payments,” and it was not clear that Varhelyi’s statement had ever reflected an official EU action.
However, the Commission also said that they did intend to review future EU assistance to Palestine.
“The thing that happened was that one commissioner, Commissioner Várhelyi, made a decision on his own without any talks with any other commissioner or with the Commission in general,” Micheál Martin said yesterday.
“Our opinion in the majority – and my own opinion – is that it makes no sense to stop the money.”

Apartheid has led to this Middle East escalation and it's civilians who will pay the price,"LAST UPDATE|12 Oct 2023
IN A REGION that draws polemical, hyperbolic and ill-informed ‘hot takes’, one thing most can agree on is the significance of events that transpired in Occupied Palestine and Israel on 7 October 2023.
In launching their audacious and unprecedented attack, Hamas’s military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades penetrated a heavily fortified, securitised and well-staffed military installation with relative ease, taking to the sea and sky in a coordinated and meticulously planned assault.
Being caught off guard in such a way has sent shock waves across Israel, a country used to having the upper hand when it comes to exerting control and colonial dominance over its Palestinian neighbours. Since then, unimaginable loss and suffering have occurred, with swathes of innocent civilians killed.
Despite being warned that an attack was imminent, the Israeli government chose to ignore it, turning attention towards managing Palestinian resistance activity across the West Bank and placating the demands of an emboldened settler movement. Hubris is the word that best describes this hotchpotch conglomerate of right-wing fanatics led by a seasoned professional with vast experience in overseeing atrocities.

How this plays out is impossible to predict. Yet it is important to reaffirm that whilst a significant moment, history did not begin on 7 October 2023. For over 75 years Palestinians have steadfastly fought for freedom and liberation, doing so against a heavily armed, internationally inoculated Israeli state.
Bombarded by sea and sky, thousands have been killed and almost triple that permanently maimed. United Nations special envoy to the Middle East noted that by the end of August 2023, over 200 Palestinians had been killed across the Occupied Territories, a death toll at itshighest since 2005.
The enduring impact of Israeli settler colonial violence on Palestinian lives and livelihoods has led to charges ofApartheidbeing advanced by Palestinian and international human rights organisations. Home demolitions, forced displacement, residency revocation, attacks on educational establishments, restrictions on movement and the recent settler-led assaults on the Al Aqsa mosque – the third holiest site in Islam – have added fuel to an already well-lit bonfire.
Recent geopolitical developments initiated by US President Donald Trump under the bilateralAbraham Accordsin 2020 have resulted in the normalising of relationships between Israel and some neighbouring Arab countries including Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. The looming possibility of a deal with the Saudi regime has been viewed by many in Palestine as yet further evidence of side-lining legitimate demands for self-determination and liberation, despite platitudes to the contrary. Therefore, anyone with even a cursory interest in the region and provided they don’t suffer from selective amnesia, should know full well that all the ingredients were there for a major escalation.
Fears of a wider, regional spill over, one that draws in purported global superpowers are well founded. Gaza has long been a focal point when it comes to revealing coordination between Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Iranian regime, both of whom have close ties with the Hamas government.
In the north, a number of minor skirmishes have taken place at the Lebanese/Israeli border involving Palestinian fighters, those who live as refugees inside Lebanon itself. The possibility of Hezbollah choosing to fully enter the fray is real. Across the West Bank, Palestinian resistance fighters continue to attack Israeli military installations, setting fire to the Jalameh checkpoint and engaging Israeli Occupation Forces at Qalandiya, the heavily fortified barrier that restricts Palestinian movement in and out of Ramallah. In areas such as Nablus and Jenin non-aligned armed Palestinian factions, including the now famous ‘Lion’s Den’, continue to actively defend their areas against regular Israeli army incursions.

Reactions of the Western superpowers, led by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, have been particularly illuminating. Any myth of non-partisanship when it comes to Palestine-Israel has been well and truly dispelled both by governmental declarations and engrained media bias. The European Union leadership’s rapid move to declare its unequivocal support for the Israeli state, projecting the Israeli flag on the side of the European Commission building, is an act of solidarity it has never once shown the Palestinian people. While Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant was busy proclaiming on live television his intent to enforce collective punishment on the Palestinian population in Gaza by shutting off the water supply and electricity and ensuring nothing enters or leaves the area, Benjamin Netanyahu turned to Twitter to share videos of buildings being pummelled indiscriminately from the air.
Simultaneously, American President Joe Biden signed off on a further 8 billion dollars of military aid to Israel, ordering the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Mediterranean Sea. Such acts further demonstrate America’s longstanding complicity in facilitating the Israeli war machine. For anyone remotely interested in international law and the laws of armed conflict, this ought to cause serious concern.
One thing we can depressingly predict is that over the next number of days and indeed weeks, those who will continue to bear the brunt of this wanton, unchecked and internationally funded settler colonial violence, will be the ordinary civilians of the Gaza Strip. Alongside the destruction of Gaza, everyday violence that characterises Israeli settler colonialism in Palestine will continue unchecked and unabated as it has done since the foundation of the state.
Any international intervention to affect change must avoid pouring oil on an already red-hot pan. Serious energies must now be devoted to ending the occupation and dismantling the Apartheid regime. Anything short of this is unacceptable.

"Red Cross in contact with Hamas over release of hostages as Gaza death toll reaches 1,200","LAST UPDATE|12 Oct 2023

THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE of the Red Cross (ICRC) is in contact with Hamas and Israel to try to negotiate the release of hostages taken into Gaza, the group said today.
At least 150 Israelis and foreigners – including soldiers, civilians, children and women – have been held hostage in the Gaza Strip since Hamas’s surprise Saturday attack on Israel.
“As a neutral intermediary we stand ready to conduct humanitarian visits; facilitate communication between hostages and family members; and to facilitate any eventual release,” Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC’s regional director for the Near and Middle East, said in a statement.
Hostage-taking is forbidden under international humanitarian law, and anyone detained must be released immediately, Carboni added.
The ICRC urged “both sides to reduce the suffering of civilians”.
In retaliation for Saturday’s attack, Israel has relentlessly pounded Gaza and imposed a complete siege on the impoverished territory of over 2 million people, cutting off water, electricity and fuel supplies.
Hamas has claimed that four of the captives died in Israeli strikes and threatened to kill others if civilian targets are bombed without advance warning.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has also started negotiations with Hamas for the release of the hostages, an official source told AFP late yesterday.
The war has already claimed several thousand lives on both sides since Saturday.
The death toll in the Gaza Strip has risen to 1,200 people, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said today.
More than 338,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Gaza, according to the UN, while the European Union has called for a “humanitarian corridor” to allow civilians to flee the enclave’s fifth war in 15 years.

Meanwhile, Israeli forces said 1,200 people, most of them civilians, were killed in the onslaught – the worst in the country’s history.
Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler and Iran’s president spoke by phone about the war between Israel and Hamas, Saudi state media said early today, their first call since a surprise rapprochement in March.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received a call yesterday from the Iranian leader, Ebrahim Raisi, during which they discussed “the current military situation in Gaza and its environs”, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said.
Prince Mohammed told Raisi that Riyadh is “communicating with all international and regional parties to stop the ongoing escalation”, SPA said.
He also stressed “the kingdom’s firm position towards supporting the Palestinian cause”, it said.
Iranian state news agency IRNA also reported on the call, saying the two men discussed the “need to end war crimes against Palestine”.
Former US President Donald Trump have tried to lay blame on the Biden administration.
“With crooked Joe Biden, you have chaos, bloodshed, war, terror and death. Look what’s happening today,” Trump told a crowd of supporters in a speech that lasted more than an hour and a half at a convention centre in West Palm Beach, Florida.
The Biden campaign said Trump has been pushing dangerous misinformation about the crisis in Israel at a time when the country should stand together.
“While Trump continues to lie about his record, President Biden is laser-focused on providing steadfast support for Israel and leading on the global stage,” Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said.

Death of 22-year-old Irish-Israeli woman Kim Damti confirmed following Hamas attack,"LAST UPDATE|11 Oct 2023
AN IRISH-ISRAELI woman who has been missing since Hamas militants launched an unprecedented series of surprise attacks on Saturday has died, the Tánaiste has confirmed.
22-year-old Kim Damti had remained unaccounted, having been attending a music festival when Hamas carried out a bloody mass-shooting on the event, which was attended by hundreds of young Israelis and foreigners near Kibbutz Reim, close to Gaza.
Tánaiste Micheál Martin said in a statement this evening that “it is with immense sadness that I learnt this evening that Kim Damti’s death has been confirmed”.
“When news reached us over the weekend that an Irish citizen was one of the many hundreds missing after the repugnant terrorist attack by Hamas in Israel, we hoped against hope that she would be found safely. The news that this hope has now been extinguished is devastating,” Martin said.
“Anyone looking at the photo of Kim in the media over the last few days will have been struck by the radiance and energy in her expression; a young 22 year old woman with a whole life ahead of her, full of promise,” he said.
“For anyone to lose a child is devastating. To lose a child in such circumstances is indescribable,” the Tánaiste said.
He added: “On my behalf and on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland, I convey our heartfelt condolences to Kim’s family in Ireland and in Israel. We are with them in their grief. I spoke with Kim’s family earlier this evening and expressed this to them.
“Our thoughts remain with all the families of those who have died, who are injured or who are missing in the wake of these terrible events.
“May her memory be a blessing.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in a statement that “as a nation we are united in mourning for Kim Damti”.

“This vibrant young Irish-Israeli woman was struck down in her prime, with her adult life ahead of her. Her death, and the deaths of more than a thousand other citizens of Israel and from around the world, was senseless and barbaric,” Varadkar said.
“Kim gave happiness and joy to her family and those around her. As we learn of her death, we pause to think of her, her family in Israel and Ireland and of all those now grieving in countless other nations.”
President Michael D Higgins said he has heard of Kim Damti’s death with the “greatest sadness”
“The circumstances in which her life was taken, having travelled as she did to attend a music festival, are truly appalling,” Higgins said.
“Kim’s death once again reminds us what an outrageous breach of fundamental international law in conditions of conflict it is to target civilians in this way,” he said.
“May I send my deepest condolences to Kim’s family, friends and all those with whom she shared her life. Suaimhneas síoraí dá hanam.”
In a post on Facebook, her sister wrote: “I announce the murder of our angel, our flower, Kim Damti who was murdered by the damned terrorists.”
She said the funeral will take place tomorrow.
Speaking toUS outlet ABC Newsfrom her home in Tel Aviv on Monday, her mother, Jennifer, described waiting to hear news about her daughter.
“You can’t sleep. All I can think about is where she is, if she’s suffering, if she’s still alive. I just want her back,” she said.
The Department of Foreign Affairs said earlier in the week that it has been in touch with Kim’s family and had been providing consular assistance.

As It Happened: Israeli Army rules out 'aerial infiltration' on northern border despite previous alerts,"LAST UPDATE|11 Oct 2023
THE ISRAELI army today ruled out an attack from Lebanon on its northern border after it  previously reported a suspected “aerial infiltration” into Israeli air space from Lebanon.
Citizens in the north were urged to take shelter after earlier reports.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon announced an “emergency government” with an opposition party leader, Benny Gantz, for the duration of the war with Gaza militants.
Palestine’s electricity authority has said Gaza’s only power plant has ran out of fuel.
The Israeli military said more than 1,200 people, including 189 soldiers, have been killed in Israel.
In Gaza, 1,100 people have been killed, according to authorities there.
22-year-old Irish-Israeli woman Kim Damti has been confirmed dead following Saturday’s attack by Hamas.
Here are the latest developments as they happened today:
11 Oct 202310:04AMOvernight air strikesHamas officials have said at least 30 people were killed and hundreds wounded in air strikes on the Gaza Strip overnight.The Israeli military confirmed it had hit several Hamas targets.It said fighter jets destroyed “advanced detection systems” that Hamas used to spot military aircraft.They also hit 80 Hamas targets in the Beit Hanoun area of the northeastern Gaza Strip, including two bank branches used by the Islamist group to “fund terrorism” in the enclave, the military said.Air strikes also hit a weapons storage facility, and an operational command centre used by the Islamic Jihad militant group, it added.11 Oct 202310:05AMTánaiste Micheál MartinYesterday, Tánaiste Micheál Martin met with his EU counterparts at an emergency videoconference meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers to discuss the ongoing violence.Speaking after the meeting, Martin said he was “clear that continued development and humanitarian support to the Palestinian people is essential”.On Monday, the European Commission launched a review of its development aid to the Palestinians.Martin said: “I underlined that the review of the European Commission’s development cooperation funding needs to take place as rapidly as possible and in close coordination with Member States.“I welcomed the confirmation that EU humanitarian aid to Palestinians will continue uninterrupted, for as long as needed.”11 Oct 202310:06AMDisplacedIn an update yesterday, the United Nations said over 260,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in the Gaza Strip, as heavy Israeli bombardments from the air, land and sea continue to hit the Palestinian enclave.“Over 263,934 people in Gaza are believed to have fled their homes,” said UN humanitarian agency OCHA said in an update yesterday, warning that “this number is expected to rise further”.Among the displaced, nearly 175,500 people sought shelter in 88 schools run by the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, it said.More than 14,500 others had fled to 12 government schools, while close to 74,000 were estimated to be staying with relatives and neighbours or seeking shelters in churches and other facilities.The number of displaced people inside of Gaza “represents the highest number of people displaced since the 50-day escalation of hostilities in 2014,” it said.11 Oct 202310:07AMDeath tollAn Israeli Defence Forces spokesperson said today that more than 1,200 Israelis have been killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict.This is an increase on the 1,000 previously reported.“The death toll is a staggering 1,200 dead Israelis,” IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said in a video message, adding that “the overwhelming majority of them” were civilians.Gaza officials have reported 900 people killed since the air strikes began.11 Oct 202310:23AMIsrael is ""surrounded by enemies""Speaking to reporters this morning, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Israel is “surrounded by enemies that want to wipe it off the face of the Earth”.However, he warned that “solidarity” with Israel “could evaporate” if its response if not proportionate.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar speaking to reporter's this morningJane Matthews / The JournalJane Matthews / The Journal / The Journal“Ireland’s position is very clear on this,” said Varadkar. “Israel is a democratic state, it’s a sovereign state. It’s a state that is internationally recognised, it has a right to exist.”He added: “It is unfortunately surrounded by enemies that want to wipe it off the face of the earth and that’s why it has to be able to defend itself.“But it has to do so in a way that’s proportionate.“We’re saying very clearly to the Israeli government that while there’s a lot of solidarity from the US and from European countries behind Israel at the moment, that solidarity could evaporate.“And I think will evaporate, if Israel’s response in Gaza is disproportionate, particularly if it targets civilians, and we very much oppose the fact that civilian infrastructure is being cut off, like water and electricity.“We think that’s very much the wrong approach.”11 Oct 202310:40AM'Potential for regional implosion'Speaking this morning on Morning Ireland, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said “we have to reflect on the enormity of the trauma and savagery that was visited upon Israeli people and Israel last Saturday”.“There is a tendency to quickly move on from it, in society in general and in commentary,” added Martin.“What we witnessed was a jihadist, pan-Islamic organisation, and there should be no truck with that.“Europe cannot, in any shape or circumstances, pull back on humanitarian aid into Gaza.“There can be no collective punishment. Israel has a right to defend itself but it must be in accordance with international law and there can’t be collective punishment of the entire civilian population in Gaza.“There is nowhere to go if you’re a resident, all exits are closed and we are very worried about a potential human catastrophe unfolding within Gaza.”Martin added that there is a worry “the potential for regional implosion”.“We’re conscious of Hezbollah in Lebanon, we’re conscious of the situation in the West Bank, and the need for calm and control.”11 Oct 202310:54AMLebanon strikesIsrael has shelled south Lebanon today following rocket fire from the border area, Lebanese state media said, the latest exchange on Israel’s northern border as it battles Hamas militants in Gaza.“The area around Dhayra is being bombarded by enemy artillery, while the area around Yarin is being hit with phosphorus shells,” Lebanon’s National News Agency said, earlier reporting “two rockets fired from Lebanese territory”.The Israeli military said that “in response to the anti-tank missiles that were launched at… soldiers a short while ago, the IDF (army) is currently striking in Lebanese territory”.11 Oct 202311:24AMIsrael not acting ‘like a state’ in Gaza – ErdoganIsrael is not conducting itself “like a state” in the Gaza Strip, Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said, as Israel pounded the territory following the weekend attack by Hamas.“Israel should not forget that if it acts more like an organisation rather than a state, it’ll finish by being treated as such,” Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, attacking “shameful methods” of the Israeli army in the densely-populated Gaza Strip.It follows a similar call for restraint by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar last night, who warned that support for Israel will “fall apart” if the country goes “too far” with their response to violence from Hamas.“From Ireland’s point of view we are saying to Israel, ‘Yes, you’ve the right to defend yourself, you’re surrounded by enemies who want to end your existence, but any response must be proportionate,’”Varadkar told RTÉ.11 Oct 202311:49AMAn update for Irish citizens in Israel has been issued by the Rrepresentative Office of Ireland in the occupied Palestinian territory.It advises that Ben Gurion Airport, located between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, is still open but several commercial airlines have suspended flights.The Office said that people should contact their airline directly for guidance and find out more onthe airport’s website.For people in the West Bank, the office advises that people continue to shelter for safety.“Some land border crossings are open, but subject to change,” the office said.pic.twitter.com/fasMeeE4KA— Ireland in Palestine (@IrlRepRamallah)October 11, 202311 Oct 202312:06PMIsrael rave organiser buried as twin brother remains missingOsher Vaknin, one of the organisers of the music festival close to the Gaza Strip which saw a shock attack by Hamas fighters, has been buried while his twin brother Michael remains missing.Osher was buried in Jerusalem yesterday, while no signs of Michael have emerged since the weekend assault on the site by the Palestinian militants.The brothers’ family members told AFP that they were still hoping for a sign of life of Michael.“He’s coming home. I hope he hasn’t been kidnapped. It’ll kill us. It’s very, very painful,” said the twins’ sister Ausa Meir, 32.Osher was killed as “he stopped the bullets for a friend, for a brother,” said Ausa, a French-Israeli mother of three.The rave organised by the twins had drawn thousands of party-goers from Friday to the desert site close to Kibbutz Reim, less than five kilometres from the Gaza Strip.Around 250 people were killed at the site alone as Hamas launched their surprise offensive on Israel.Around 150 people were taken prisoner by Hamas. Not all their identities are known or have been made public. The channels of negotiation or discussion over their fate have so far been remained secretive.Aerial images obtained by AFP showed dozens of burnt-out cars on the side of the road leading to the festival site.Sunny Vaknin, Osher’s widow, said she went to search for her husband on Monday.“We thought he was still alive, we had hope.

If it’s unacceptable for the president of Russia to target power stations or to [target] civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, the same must apply to the Israeli government and the actions it takes on targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure in Gaza.”11 Oct 202312:24PMNine UN staff killed in airstrikesThe UN says that nine of its staff have been “killed in airstrikes” on the Gaza Strip since Saturday.“The protection of civilians is paramount, including in times of conflict.

I think we have to be clear and unambiguous about that,” Coveney said.“What is happening now, unfortunately in Gaza as Israel responses to that savagery is also hugely concerning,” he said.Coveney served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2020 to 2022. During his time in the role, he visited Gaza, the West Bank and Israel on numerous occasions.The Minister said Israel has “a right to defend itself and its people”,  but added that it has to “abide by international law”.“What we’re seeing at the moment is a small piece of land that’s 12km wide and 42km long, that’s it. About 2.2 million people live there and they have nowhere they can escape to,” he said.Coveney added: “I think what we have to try and do as an international community now is to try and find a way of protecting civilians, to open up humanitarian corridors.”He said he believes Israel is “going after the militants responsible”, but added: “The problem with that, through, is that Gaza is such a densely populated place where civilians cannot escape because they have nowhere to go to. They can’t escape into Egypt, they can’t escape into Israel.“That is why the international community needs to insist on Israel abiding by international law and taking actions to protect civilians.”11 Oct 20235:42PMA large crowd of people have turned out for a protest in support of Palestine in Dublin city centre this evening.The crowd is chanting “free free Palestine”.pic.twitter.com/ssPMijPkWW— Eimer McAuley (@eimer_mcauley)October 11, 202311 Oct 20235:45PMAt least 22 US citizens have been killed since Hamas militants launched its attack against Israel, the US State Department has said, with Washington pledging firm support for its close ally.“At this time, we can confirm the deaths of at least 22 US citizens.  We extend our deepest condolences to the victims and to the families of all those affected,” a State Department spokesperson said.11 Oct 20236:29PMThe Israeli army has denied claims that there was an “aerial infiltration” from Lebanon  and claimed an “error” was behind reports of a suspected attack.The force also ruled out any major incident near the border.The matter is currently being looked into, an army spokesperson told Israeli local media.“There are no launches at this point from Lebanon.

"Varadkar: 'If it's unacceptable for Putin to target power stations, the same must apply to Israel'","LAST UPDATE|11 Oct 2023
THE TAOISEACH HAS warned Israel against targeting civilian infrastructure in its reprisal attacks on Hamas in Gaza, drawing a comparison with Vladimir Putin’s assaults on power stations in Ukraine.
At Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil this afternoon, Leo Varadkar warned that Israel must not carry out such attacks over the coming days and weeks.
“Israel is gaining a lot of solidarity from other parts of the world but I believe that will evaporate and evaporate very quickly, if the Israeli response in Gaza and elsewhere is disproportionate, so there must be restraint,” Varadkar said.
“There must be no attacks on civilian infrastructure. If it’s unacceptable for the president of Russia to target power stations or civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, the same must apply to the Israeli government and the actions it takes on targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure in Gaza.”
Varadkar added that aid funding amounting to €16m for Palestinians will remain in place and stressed that the money would not end up with Hamas.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald welcomed the government’s commitment to aid and also Varadkar’s stance that the “Israeli state is not exempt” from the rule of law.
Both leaders condemned Hamas for last Saturday’s surprise onslaught, which has resumed intense conflict resulting in the death of over 2,000 people in Israel and Gaza.

1,200 Israelis are reported dead and 900 people in Gaza have been killed.
McDonald said there needed to be a “step change” in how the region is approached.
She said Israel “cannot play fast or loose as a rogue state violating again and again the basic rights of the Palestinian people”, and called for the government to take a firm line.
In response, Varadkar said the “baseline position” is that peace can only be achieved through a two-state solution, which he said becomes “increasingly difficult with every day that passes, every settlement that is built” in the region.
At tonight’s Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting, it was unanimously agreed to send a letter of condolence to the Israeli embassy following the attack, including an appeal for restraint and adherance to international law.
Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney told the meeting that the attack by Hamas had to be condemned unreservedly as an act of terrorism.
He also emphasised the need for de-escalation of violence and adherence to international law to protect innocent civilians in Gaza.

As it happened: Death toll surges in Gaza and Israel amid warning of 'humanitarian catastrophe',"LAST UPDATE|10 Oct 2023
THE DEATH TOLL in the Israel-Hamas war rose to more than 1,000 people in Israel and over 800 in Gaza as fighting continued today.
The Israeli army said it had “more or less restored control” over the Gaza border after Saturday’s mass breach by Palestinian gunmen.
The army also said it had recovered the bodies of around 1,500 Hamas militants inside Israel, confirming the scale of the assault over the weekend.
Nearly 190,000 people have been displaced in Gaza since the escalation of the conflict, according to the United Nations.
Here were some of the latest developments today:
10 Oct 20239:14AMGood morning, it’s Niall O’Connor starting the liveblog today.Inour article this morningwe revealed that before dawn, the Israeli military struck what it said were Hamas targets in Gaza, especially in the Rimal neighbourhood and in the southern city of Khan Yunis.Hamas – which the Israeli army estimates sent about 1,000 fighters across the border, spraying gunfire at civilians – said yesterday that Israeli air strikes had killed four of the hostages.It later said it could start killing them itself.Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel would impose a “complete siege” on the long-blockaded enclave of 2.3 million people: “No electricity, no food, no water, no gas – it’s all closed.”United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply distressed” by the siege announcement, and warned Gaza’s already dire humanitarian situation will now “only deteriorate exponentially”.Palestinians search the rubble of a destroyed house, following an Israeli airstrike on Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo10 Oct 20239:16AMThe AFP is reporting that a media union is stating that three Palestinian journalists have been killed in an Israeli strike on Gaza City.10 Oct 20239:35AMIsrael’s total siege of the Gaza Strip is banned under international law, the United Nations human rights chief said today.“The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” Volker Turk said in a statement.10 Oct 202310:17AMThe World Health Organization called this morning for a humanitarian corridor to be established into and out of the Gaza Strip, which has been placed under total siege by Israel.“WHO is calling for an end to the violence… A humanitarian corridor is needed to reach people with critical medical supplies,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a press briefing in Geneva.Israeli forces had told Gaza residents to leave the city as they said it would be “turned into rubble”.10 Oct 202310:21AMIranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has denied any involvement by his country in Hamas’s shock weekend attack on Israel despite its strong support for the Palestinian militant group.“The supporters of the Zionist regime (Israel) and some people in the usurping regime have been spreading rumours over the past two or three days, including that Islamic Iran was behind this action. They are wrong,” Khamenei said in a speech at a military academy.“Of course, we defend Palestine, we defend the struggles,” he added, urging “the whole Islamic world” to “support the Palestinians.”Khamenei said Israel has suffered an “irreparable failure” on both “military and intelligence” fronts.Iran had issued statements on Saturday welcoming the Hamas attack.The Israeli army said it was the single deadliest event in the nation’s history, and has responded with a bombardment of Gaza where officials say at least 687 people have been killed.10 Oct 202311:39AMTánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Micheál Martin, will attend a meeting of the European Union Foreign Ministers at 3pm to discuss events in Gaza.The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he has invited the top diplomats from Israel and the Palestinian Authority to address the emergency meeting.Borrell said Israel’s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen and Palestinian counterpart Riyad al-Maliki were asked to participate in the hybrid video and in-person talks after the surprise Hamas assault.He will step out of the Dáil and attend the meeting online as the crisis deepens in the Middle East.The topic of EU aid to Palestine is likely to be on the agenda given that there has been some dispute regarding the cancelling of assistance.The Commission reversed its decision to suspend development aid payments to Palestinians, contradicting its commissioner forNeighbourhood and EngagementOliver Varhelyi.Varhelyi posted on social media earlier that the EU is also placing €691 million of support “under review” after the Hamas assault on Israel.European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, left, speaks with Micheal Martin.Alamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock Photo10 Oct 202312:05PMFrench President Emmanuel Macron denounced “unacceptable blackmail” by Hamas after the Palestinian militant group threatened to execute some of the around 150 hostages it abducted in a weekend assault.“The blackmail by Hamas after its terrorist acts is odious and unacceptable,” Macron told reporters on a visit to Germany.The French president added that he considered it “likely” that Hamas had outside “help” in its onslaught against Israel.But he stressed there was “no formal trace” of any “direct involvement” by Iran, at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.10 Oct 202312:20PMActionAid has warned about the ‘rapidly escalating’ humanitarian crisis in Gaza.“The situation inside Gaza is dire as homes and civilians remain the indiscriminate targets of continuous bombing,” Karol Balfe, CEO of ActionAid Ireland, said.“Our colleagues have fled their homes and are currently using hospitals as shelters. Air raids continue throughout the day and night and our partners are telling us that entire families have lost their lives.”Civilian infrastructure has been damaged too, with over 400,000 people living without clean water and sanitation. Additionally, hospitals are running out of medical supplies as the death toll and casualties increase exponentially.Balfe continued: “We’re only a few days into the crisis, but the unprecedented scale of hostilities threatens a humanitarian emergency on an unimaginable scale, even for a region all too familiar with conflict. With a ‘total blockade’ announced in Gaza, over two million people will be plunged even further into crisis and completely cut off from food, electricity, and fuel.”“We are urgently calling for an end to the violence and to the safe passage of humanitarian aid to those that need it the most.”10 Oct 20231:03PMHello, it’s Órla Ryan here, taking over the liveblog from Niall O’Connor.In our story yesterday, Jane Matthews reported that a Government minister and two MEPs said theydo not agreewith the projection of the Israeli flag on the European Commission building in Brussels over the weekend.In a further update, independent Irish MEPs Mick Wallace and Clare Daly today wrote to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to “demand an urgent investigation into the decision to project the Israeli flag on to the facade of the building”.In a joint statement, Wallace and Daly said they “want to know what is the legal basis for the decision to project the flag and if the Commission is satisfied that it has remained within the limits of its powers in taking this decision”.The two MEPs also want to know “who initiated the decision and who sanctioned it”.Israel Defense Minister: ""I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip.

In addition, the conventions demand that the wounded and sick are cared for,” ICRC president Mirjana Spoljaric said.She added that she is “extremely concerned” about the suffering families who have lost contact with loved ones and were now in a “devastating situation”.The ICRC said that without immediate restraint, the conflict was heading towards a humanitarian disaster in which civilians would pay the highest price.“All sides must exercise restraint and protect civilian lives and property,” Spoljaric said.10 Oct 20231:16PMRussian President Vladimir Putin, whose country is currently waging war on Ukraine, said the Israel-Gaza war showed the “failure” of Washington’s Middle East policy and called the creation of “an independent sovereign Palestinian state” a “necessity”.“I think many people would agree with me that it’s a clear example of the failure of US politics in the Middle East,” Putin said while meeting Iraq’s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in Moscow today.10 Oct 20231:30PMMore than 187,500 people have been displaced in Gaza since the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hamas, according to the United Nations.The report from the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) comes amid ongoing airstrikes in the region.UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said it is hosting more than 137,000 people in schools across the territory.10 Oct 20231:48PMPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Israel’s military campaign following Saturday’s surprise onslaught is only the start of a sustained war to destroy Hamas and “change the Middle East”.The Israeli army has called up 300,000 reservists for its Swords of Iron campaign and massed tanks and other heavy armour both near Gaza, and on the northern border with Lebanon, AFP reports.The military said its forces had largely reclaimed the embattled south and the border around Gaza and dislodged holdout Hamas fighters from more than a dozen towns and kibbutzim.“Around 1,500 bodies of Hamas (fighters) have been found in Israel around the Gaza Strip,” army spokesman Richard Hecht said earlier, adding that security forces had “more or less restored control over the border” with the enclave.10 Oct 20231:52PMThe United States — which reported 11 of its own citizens killed, and more missing in the spiralling conflict — stressed its full support for Israel, as did Britain, France, Germany and Italy.Their five leaders said they “recognise the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people” but said Hamas “offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed”, in a joint statement released by the White House.The five Western powers and many other nations have reported citizens killed, abducted or missing, also including Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Mexico, Nepal, Panama, Paraguay, Russia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Ukraine.Israeli-Irish woman Kim Damti (22)remains unaccounted forafter attending a music festival where one of the Hamas attacks occurred at the weekend.10 Oct 20231:53PMWashington has pledged to send munitions and military equipment to back Israel and deployed an aircraft carrier group to the eastern Mediterranean, AFP reports.The White House said there was no intention to put US boots on the ground, while also condemning the “ISIS-level savagery” of the Hamas attack.Israel faced the threat of a multi-front war after two days of clashes on the northern border with Lebanon with militants from the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.Unrest has also surged in the occupied West Bank, where 15 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday.Iran — which is openly committed to Israel’s destruction — has praised the surprise attack by Hamas but repeatedly denied playing any role in it.10 Oct 20232:00PMThe EU has called for an end to the violence and for all sides to protect civilians.EU ministers have been meeting with their Gulf counterparts in Oman this afternoon.The reaction of neighbouring countries is seen as important in trying to avoid the conflict in Israel spreading across the region.I have invited Israeli Foreign Minister@elicoh1to join the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers I am convening this afternoon.I have also invited Foreign Minister Malki@pmofato address the meeting and present the views of the Palestinian Authority.— Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF)October 10, 2023This lunchtime – following the EU-Gulf Cooperation Council meeting – the EU’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell called for calm, EU News Radio reports.“It is urgent to step up international efforts to stop violence and prevent regional destabilisation,” he tweeted.I met today with Saudi Foreign Minister@FaisalbinFarhanto exchange views on the situation in Israel/Palestine.

The United Nations today said that the siege is “prohibited” under international law and called for the establishment of “a humanitarian corridor”.Travel through the Rafah crossing is restricted to humanitarian cases and requires often time-consuming authorisations.10 Oct 20232:52PMWe now have more details on the comments made by the United Nations human rights chief about the total siege of Gaza.Volker Turk said the siege, which is depriving civilians of goods essential for survival, is banned under international law.Turk called for all sides instead to defuse the “explosive powder-keg situation”, as Israel warned of a sustained war to destroy Hamas.“We know from bitter experience that vengeance is not the answer, and ultimately innocent civilians pay the price,” he said.#Israel#OPT–@volker_turkmakes urgent plea to all States with influence to take steps to defuse the “powder keg” situation causing loss of life & incalculable suffering.

surprise weekend assault on Israel, threatened to execute the hostages if Israeli air strikes continue “targeting” Gaza residents without warning, AFP reports.The threat came after Israel on Monday imposed a total siege on the Gaza Strip, cutting off food, water and electricity supplies.“The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,” Turk said in a statement today.The siege risks seriously compounding the already dire human rights and humanitarian situation in Gaza, the statement said.Any restrictions on the movement of people and goods to implement a siege must be justified by military necessity or may otherwise amount to collective punishment, it added.Turk called on influential countries to try to de-escalate the situation.“We know how this plays out, time and time again — the loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives and incalculable suffering inflicted on both communities,” he said.The UN high commissioner for human rights said he was “deeply shocked and appalled by allegations of summary executions of civilians, and, in some instances, horrifying mass killings by members of Palestinian armed groups”.“It is horrific and deeply distressing to see images of those captured by Palestinian armed groups being ill-treated, as well as reports of killings and the desecration of their bodies,” he added.“Civilians must never be used as bargaining chips.”10 Oct 20232:53PMThe ongoing UN investigation into alleged human rights violations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict said there was “already clear evidence that war crimes may have been committed” since Saturday.“All those who have violated international law and targeted civilians must be held accountable for their crimes,” the Commission of Inquiry said.The COI, the highest-level investigation that can be ordered by the UN Human Rights Council, was set up in May 2021 to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.The independent commission said it had been “collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes committed by all sides” in the current conflict.“Taking civilian hostages and using civilians as human shields are war crimes,” it said.It is also “gravely concerned” by Israel’s total siege on the Gaza Strip, “which will undoubtedly cost civilian lives and constitutes collective punishment”.10 Oct 20233:31PMThe death toll in Israel has surged above 900 from the worst attack in the country’s 75-year history, while Gaza officials have reported around 770 people killed so far.Hamas gunmen killed more than 100 people in the kibbutz of Beeri alone, said Moti Bukjin, a volunteer with the charity Zaka that recovers bodies in accordance with Jewish law.“They shot everyone,” he told AFP. “They murdered in cold blood children, babies, old people — everyone.”10 Oct 20233:36PMIsraeli warplanes hammered the Gaza Strip

and development support for the Palestinians in the occupied territories.”Borrell said it was “false information” that Germany was cancelling aid after Saturday’s attack, which was strongly condemned by the EU.“The German minister has clearly stated that this was not the case at all, that Germany will continue providing this support,” he told media.“Certainly looking at the further development of the medium and long term, but not suspending.”The EU had earlier rowed back comments from neighbourhood commissioner Oliver Varhelyi on Monday that the 27-nation bloc was immediately suspending “all payments” to the Palestinians.The EU’s executive arm said it was reviewing hundreds of millions of euros of development aid from the bloc, the biggest donor to the Palestinians, but that payments were not suspended.10 Oct 20233:59PMGaza’s sole border crossing with Egypt, the only entry point not controlled by Israel, was hit by an Israeli air strike Tuesday for the third time in 24 hours, an AFP photographer and an NGO said.The third strike against the Rafah crossing consisted of “four missiles” which targeted the Palestinian side of the crossing, local Egyptian group Sinai for Human Rights reported.10 Oct 20234:04PMThe White House has said it is taking Hamas threats to execute hostages seriously, as US President Joe Biden prepares to deliver remarks about Israel’s war with the militant group.Biden has not spoken in public since Sunday, and while the 80-year-old has staunchly backed Israel, his response to a possible hostage crisis and threat of a regional war is under the microscope.The president has said that Americans are likely among those abducted and taken to Gaza by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in its surprise attack Saturday on Israel, while at least 11 US citizens were dead.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were due to speak to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today after meeting their national security teams, the White House said.With Netanyahu they would “discuss our support for Israel” and efforts to “deter other hostile actors from exploiting this attack on Israel” — an apparent reference to Iran, which backs Hamas, and the militant group Hezbollah operating from southern Lebanon.Biden is then due to deliver remarks at 1pm Washington DC time (6pm Irish time) from the White House, AFP reports.10 Oct 20234:28PMA fresh salvo of rockets was fired from south Lebanon towards Israel today, Lebanese state media said, an attack that drew retaliatory fire, according to a military source, AFP reports.It is the third day the border area has seen an exchange of fire.“Rockets were fired from… southern Lebanon towards the Galilee” region in northern Israel, the official National News Agency (NNA) said, while the military source, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media, confirmed that it triggered retaliatory Israeli fire.The military source said the rockets were fired from the town of Qlaileh, located in the south Lebanon district of Tyre.There were no immediate reports of casualties on the Lebanese side, according to NNA.No group immediately claimed the rocket fire.“In response to the launches identified from Lebanese territory toward Israeli territory, IDF (army) soldiers are currently responding with artillery fire,” Israeli forces said.10 Oct 20235:21PMThe United Nations

Musk later deleted his post.Brooking posted on X that Musk had enabled fake war reporting by abandoning the blue check verification system for trusted accounts and allowing anyone to buy a blue check.Brooking today said that it is “significantly harder to determine ground truth in this conflict as compared to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine” last year and “Elon Musk bears personal responsibility for this”.10 Oct 20236:20PMOxfam International has warned that a total siege on Gaza will lead to “a humanitarian catastrophe”.Oxfam has suspended all of its humanitarian and development work in Gaza due to the ongoing airstrikes and violence.BREAKING:@oxfamis warning that a total siege on#Gazawill lead to a humanitarian catastrophe.Read our full statement 👉https://t.co/KAHIFyx8sHpic.twitter.com/N6eWNX8iIG— Oxfam International (@Oxfam)October 10, 2023Mustafa Tamaizeh, Oxfam Acting Country Director in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel, said:“Oxfam is horrified by the recent attacks.

Varadkar says Israel will lose global support if it goes 'too far' in its response against Hamas,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said support for Israel will “fall apart” if the country goes “too far” with their response to violence from Hamas.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Nine O’Clock news this evening, Varadkar said he was “horrified” by what was happening in Israel and Palestine.
Varadkar said: “From Ireland’s point of view we are saying to Israel, ‘Yes, you’ve the right to defend yourself, you’re surrounded by enemies who want to end your existence, but any response must be proportionate,’.”
“And there’s a risk then of violence flaring up in the West Bank, in Lebanon, other places. So we’re very much calling for restraint,” the Taoiseach added.
Earlier today, Israeli soldiers took back control of areas including Kfar Aza, around 5km east of Gaza.Hamas militants overran the kibbutz on Saturday, where many Israelis were killed and taken captive.

The death-toll has now exceeded 1,000. Nearly 190,000 people have been displaced in Gaza since the escalation of the conflict, according to the United Nations.
A number of attacks carried out by Palestinian militant group, Hamas,took place over the weekend, as the terrorist group attempted to take over areas of Israel, close to the Gaza Strip.
Since then, Israel hasunleashed all-out war on the militant group and has also started a bombing campaign on Gaza, the compact home to 2.3 million Palestinian people – one of the most densely populated areas in the world.
Varadkar said: “We’re particularly concerned for an Irish-Israeli citizen, Kim Danti. We don’t know whether or not she’s still alive, we certainly hope she is, and we’ll help in any way that we can,” he added.
22-year-old Kim Damti remains unaccounted for, having been attending a music festival when Hamas carried out a bloody mass-shooting on the event, which was attended by hundreds of young Israelis and foreigners near Kibbutz Reim, close to Gaza.
Speaking toUS outlet ABC Newsfrom her home in Tel Aviv, her mother, Jennifer, described waiting to hear news about her daughter.
“You can’t sleep. All I can think about is where she is, if she’s suffering, if she’s still alive. I just want her back,” she said.

EU warns Musk X spreading 'illegal' disinformation after Hamas attack,"
THE EU HAS warned Elon Musk that his platform X, formerly Twitter, is spreading “illegal content and disinformation”.
In a letter, commissioner Thierry Breton said concerns had heightened after the Hamas attack against Israel, and demanded Musk respond to the complaint within 24 hours and contact “relevant law enforcement authorities”.
As the European Union’s commissioner for industry and the digital economy, Breton is charged with regulating internet giants that trade within the bloc, and can launch legal action.
“Following the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas against Israel, we have indications that your platform is being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU,” Breton wrote.
Breton reminded Musk that EU law sets tough rules on moderating content, “especially when it comes to violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform”.
He asked that X respond to his complaint within 24 hours and also get in touch with Europol, the EU police coordinating agency.
“We will include your answer in our assessment file on your compliance with the DSA,” Breton said, referring to the new EU Digital Services Act, which regulates online platforms.
“I remind you that following the opening of a potential investigation and a finding of non-compliance, penalties can be imposed,” it said.

X did not respond immediately to a request from AFP for comment, replying: “Busy now, please check later”.
Hate and violence
Brussels has previously complained that, among the large-scale internet platforms that fall under the DSA remit, Musk’s Twitter now rebranded X spreads the biggest proportion of disinformation.
In August, when the new law came into effect, Musk replied to a post by Breton promising that the platform was “working hard” to comply, but there have been more warning signs.
While the rules were still voluntary, the firm pulled out of an oversight group, and Musk — a self-styled “free speech absolutist” — has been dismissive of criticism in his personal posts.
In September, the billionaire tech mogul boasted that he had cut half of its global team dedicated to monitoring and limiting disinformation and fraud around major elections.
Since Saturday’s shock attack on Israeli communities by the Hamas militant group, web platforms have been swamped by posts containing fake or misrepresented reports and footage.
While the confirmed death toll in the renewed war has now passed 3,000 — unconfirmed, exaggerated or false reports of atrocities have also proliferated.
Experts fear these moves have increased the risk of misinformation provoking real-world harm, amplifying hate and violence.

"Around 1,500 bodies of Hamas militants found in Israel, as army 'restores control' of border","LAST UPDATE|10 Oct 2023

AROUND 1,500 BODIES of Hamas militants have been found in Israel around the Gaza Strip, the army said this morning, as it pummelled the Palestinian enclave with air strikes.
“Approximately 1,500 bodies of Hamas (fighters) were found in Israel around the Gaza Strip,” military spokesman Richard Hecht told reporters, adding that security forces had “more or less restored control over the border” with Gaza.
“Since last night we know that no one came in .. but infiltrations can still happen.”
The army had “nearly completed” evacuation of all the communities around the border, he added.
Hecht said the military had deployed 35 battalions to the border area.
“We are building infrastructure for future operations,” he said.
Israel is reeling under a deadly attack by Hamas militants who stormed the border fence under a barrage of rocket fire on Saturday morning and killed more than 900 people inside Israel.
Before dawn today, the Israeli military struck what it said were Hamas targets in Gaza, especially in the Rimal neighbourhood and in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
Hamas – which the Israeli army estimates sent about 1,000 fighters across the border, spraying gunfire at civilians – said yesterday that Israeli air strikes had killed four of the hostages.
It later said it could start killing them itself.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel would impose a “complete siege” on the long-blockaded enclave of 2.3 million people: “No electricity, no food, no water, no gas – it’s all closed.”
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply distressed” by the siege announcement, and warned Gaza’s already dire humanitarian situation will now “only deteriorate exponentially”.
Palestinians in the coastal territory braced for what many feared will be a massive Israeli ground attack aiming to defeat Hamas and liberate the hostages.

Israel has expressed alarm and revulsion at Hamas’s attack across the Gaza border fence – long deemed impregnable and guarded by surveillance cameras, drones, patrols and watchtowers.
More than 270 bodies, mostly young people, were strewn across the site of a music festival in a Negev desert kibbutz, while other revellers were feared to be among the captives taken into Gaza.
“They butchered people in cold blood in an inconceivable way,” said Moti Bukjin of the Zaka religious volunteer group which helped collect the human remains.
Among the hostages were children and a Holocaust survivor in a wheelchair, Israeli officials have said, while foreign or dual nationals have been reported abducted or missing by countries including Thailand, Germany, Argentina, France and the United States.
Israelis have voiced anger at the intelligence failure.
But for now, its people appear to have put aside divisions over plans by Netanyahu’s hard-right government for judicial reforms.
In his speech, Netanyahu called on opposition leaders to immediately form “an emergency government of national unity without any preconditions”.
Inside Gaza, air strikes wrought widespread destruction in the Jabalia refugee camp, where charred bodies were pulled from the rubble and relatives wailed in grief.
Israel has blockaded Gaza since Hamas assumed control there in 2007, leading to four previous wars with Israel.
Israeli strikes have levelled residential tower blocks, a large mosque and the territory’s major bank building.
The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees said it was sheltering more than 137,000 people in schools across Gaza.
“The situation is unbearable,” Amal al-Sarsawi, 37, said from a classroom with her terrified children.
Protests and solidarity rallies have been taking place around the world over the last 24 hours, as international pressure builds on both groups.
Rishi Sunak said the “barbaric acts” committed by Hamas were “evil”.
“There is no other word to describe what we have have seen,” he said.

The Israeli embassy there was boarded up as hundreds took part in a pro-Palestine demonstration on Monday.
Groups including Stop the War and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign gathered at the embassy in Kensington, waving placards calling for Israel to “end the occupation”.
Fireworks were let off, flares were lit and chants of “Israel is a terrorist state”, “Free Palestine” and “Allahu akbar” rang out.

The European Commission hasreversed its decision to suspend development aidpayments to Palestinians, contradicting its commissioner for Neighbourhood and Engagement Oliver Varhelyi.
Earlier, Varhelyi posted on social media earlier that the EU is also placing €691 million of support “under review” after the Hamas assault on Israel.
The move was criticised by the Irish government as it believed there was “no legal basis” for the Commissioner’s “unilateral decision”.
The Department of Foreign Affairs has said it is untrue that the Irish state refused to support thecategorisation of Hamas as a “terrorist organisation”in the EU’s initial statement on the war between Israel and Hamas.
European news site i24NEWS yesterday claimed that the EU wanted to issue a “harsher statement” on the war, but Luxembourg, Ireland and Denmark refused to call Hamas a terror organisation in the statement.
A source has toldThe Journalthat in reality, Ireland had called for a statement that asked for a de-escalation of hostilities on both sides.

 International community needs to intervene to stop a catastrophe in the Middle East","LAST UPDATE|9 Oct 2023
SATURDAY’S ATTACK ON Israel by Hamas was unprecedented in its scale and level of infiltration into Israeli territory.
In the early hours of the morning, Hamas unleashed a massive wave of rockets and missiles towards Israeli settlements and towns – over 20 target areas – including Tel Aviv.
To fire an indiscriminate barrage of such projectiles toward civilian targets constitutes a war crime. It is forbidden under international law to deliberately target civilians and civilian ‘objects’ in artillery or air strikes.
The large number of missiles – Hamas claims 5000 projectiles and drones in the first wave – was designed to overwhelm Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile shield.
Hamas, along with Hezbollah in Lebanon, have a track record in firing missiles into Israeli territory.
However, as the salvoes of missiles were fired, approximately 1,000 heavily armed Hamas fighters swarmed a number of checkpoints in the fortified perimeter between Gaza and Israel.
Israeli troops were overwhelmed – killed in firefights – at Erez, Kisufim and Kerem Shalom crossing points. They also breached perimeter fences and poured across the border into Israel in pick-up trucks, on motorcycles and on foot.
The scale of this infiltration is unprecedented. Hamas fighters rapidly moved east, rampaging through the towns and settlements of Sderot, Yad Mordechai, Kfar Aza, Yated, Kissufim, Be’eri – penetrating as far east as Ofakim, 22 km from Gaza.
Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) troops were taken completely by surprise – Saturday is the Jewish Sabbath day, and was also the Jewish festival of Sukkot.
Gaza is under constant surveillance by air, satellite and a myriad of observation and listening posts operated by the IDF and security agencies such as Mossad.
The fact that Hamas achieved surprise and such a large movement of people, weapons and such a concentrated missile and drone assault prompts serious questions about Israel’s security readiness. Israeli military and political spokespersons are referring to Saturday’s operation as Israel’s ‘9/11’.
Hamas members fired automatic weapons point blank at men, women and children in kibbutz farms, villages and towns. Their attacks were deliberate – survivors report controlled bursts of fire, methodical killing on sight of any Israeli civilian, police officer or soldier that presented an opportunity target.
It is clear that Hamas anticipated a narrow or short window of opportunity for their offensive and took hostages – over 100 soldiers and civilians – back across the border into Gaza.
The targeting, killing and abduction of civilians in this manner represent war crimes and acts of terrorism.
The killing of young people at the Supernova concert at Re’im in the Negev Desert was another heinous act of terrorism. The Israelis report that over 200 concert-goers were murdered there.
Survivors say that the gunmen pursued their targets and executed young men and women wherever they found them. Those killed, abducted and now missing include Israeli citizens and many nationalities including US citizens, German citizens and at least one Irish woman, Kim Damti.
The IDF are now in the process of re-sealing the border with Gaza and isolating and neutralising any remaining pockets of Hamas fighters at large in Israeli territory. They are also carrying out hundreds of air and missile strikes inside Gaza.
The Palestinians report that hundreds of civilians have been killed in these attacks, including almost 80 children.
Israel reports that over 700 Israelis have been killed thus far with thousands injured.
Having sealed the border with Gaza, a ground incursion against Hamas targets would appear to be the IDF’s next step. Many more people will die in Gaza if the IDF do this.

They are amassing Merkava main battle tanks, armoured personnel carriers and self propelled artillery pieces forward to staging areas along the perimeter fence.
With a population of over 2 million people crammed into the strip – approximately 42km by 7km – deploying such a force will inevitably result in very high casualties.
Under international law and the laws of armed conflict, in such a scenario, Israel is required to provide evacuation corridors and humanitarian corridors to allow Gazans to leave the Gaza Strip in safety in advance of any military operations.
If Israel fails to do so – if it fails to evacuate civilians, women, children, the elderly, disabled and injured – it will be in breach of its commitments under the Geneva Conventions.
There are several hundred Irish peacekeepers deployed with UNIFIL – the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon – along the Israeli-Lebanese border. UNIFIL, along with IDF spokespersons, are reporting increased military activity along the border with exchanges of artillery fire in the area.
UNIFIL has stated that its peacekeepers – including the Irish contingent – remain ‘on task’, with force protection measures in place.
The fact that the IDF – at a time when they are officially ‘at war’ with Hamas has mobilised and deployed such a large force north towards Lebanon is a highly significant move.
Hezbollah has stated that they will attack Israel if it proceeds with a ground incursion into the Gaza Strip. If Hezbollah were to attack Israel, it would present a significant local and regional challenge to the Israeli government.
To neutralise Hezbollah – who are backed by Iran – the IDF would have to engage them in conventional ground combat, almost certainly inside Lebanon.
This would be a very costly exercise and despite their technological and military superiority, the IDF could expect to take very heavy casualties.
Such action would also risk a direct confrontation with Iran. In the aftermath of the ‘Global War on Terror’ and the invasion of Iraq, Teheran now has an axis of control – with Shia proxies providing a land corridor from Iran itself, through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
This would allow for the movement of weapons, missiles and reinforcements toward the Mediterranean and south Lebanon.
It is also a particularly dangerous moment for Irish UNIFIL troops. I have no doubt that the Irish military authorities and the Irish government will be contingency planning for any escalation of the conflict in this sensitive border area.
The Palestinian people have endured decades of appalling violence and abuse – including a system of apartheid – imposed upon them by the Israeli state.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians – including over 33,000 children – have been slaughtered by Israeli forces in this intractable conflict.
The terrorist attacks by Hamas at the weekend have not advanced the cause of the Palestinian people.
These war crimes perpetrated at the behest of the leadership of Hamas will inevitably lead to mass casualties among the civilian population in the coming days and weeks.
These will likely include Israeli and international hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. What is required on all sides now is political leadership in order to prevent a wider regional conflict.
With Likud’s Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Gaza, I’m fearful of what will happen next.
The international community need to intervene to prevent a catastrophe which could completely de-stabilise the Middle East and beyond.

Ireland should engage with its international partners to deescalate the situation and prevent further loss of life.9 Oct 20233:17PMPalestinian Islamist group Hamas is not open to negotiating a prisoner exchange with Israel during hostilities, a member of the militants’ political office has said.“The military operation is still continuing… therefore there is currently no chance for negotiation on the issue of prisoners or anything else,” Hossam Badran, a Hamas official, told AFP from Doha.“Our mission now is to make every effort to prevent the occupation from continuing to commit massacres against our people in Gaza, which directly target civilian homes,” he added.Israel has said it is working to free at least 100 people kidnapped as Hamas militants stormed the Gaza border on Saturday, shooting people in nearby communities and towns.9 Oct 20233:27PMSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald TD saidthe targeting of civilians and the taking of hostages by Hamas“is to be condemned outright”.Speaking to RTE’s News At One and referring to slaying of around 250 people who attended an outdoor music festival in an Israeli community near Gaza at the weekend, the Sinn Fein leader said to see young people out enjoying themselves and meeting “such a violent and traumatic death is just truly horrific”.“I understand perfectly the sense of trauma that’s been expressed,” she added.“What happened at the weekend in terms of targeting civilians and hostage taking is not on,” said McDonald, calling it a breach to international law that must be condemned.Asked whether she had met with the Hamas leadership, she said: “I have been to the West Bank and I have met with everybody.”After confirming that this included Hamas, she said “that’s the correct way to approach this. We should know in Ireland, if you are serious about achieving a ceasefire, which is necessary, a path to peace and respect for international law in a conflict situation, you meet and talk to everybody. That’s the only way you can find a pathway forward.”9 Oct 20233:40PMFile photo - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuAlamy Stock PhotoAlamy Stock PhotoIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has today vowed to “change the Middle East” in Israel’s war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, as the army pounded the Gaza Strip with air strikes.“What Hamas will experience will be difficult and terrible… we are going to change the Middle East,” Netanyahu told officials visiting Jerusalem from the country’s south, where Hamas militants carried out the surprise attack on Saturday morning.“This is only the beginning … we are all with you and we will defeat them with force, enormous force.”9 Oct 20233:43PMArab League foreign ministers will meet on Wednesday to discuss “Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip” following the surprise assault by Hamas on Israel, the regional bloc has announced.The “extraordinary meeting” in Cairo will seek to find “avenues of political action at the Arab and international level”, Arab League deputy chief Hossam Zaki said in a statement.9 Oct 20233:48PMIf you are looking to catch up on the developments on what has unfolded since Saturday, here’s a timeline of events:Timeline: Here is what has happened in Israel and Gaza since Saturday9 Oct 20233:51PMScotland’s First Minister Humza Yousaf has said his wife’s parents are currently “trapped” in Gaza.Yousaf’s wife Nadia El-Nakla is Palestinian and her parents, who live in Dundee, northeast Scotland, were visiting family in Gaza.“They’ve been in Gaza and are currently trapped in Gaza, I’m afraid,” he told reporters.Yousaf, who in March became the first Muslim leader of a government in western Europe, said the Israeli authorities had told his parents-in-law to leave but not guaranteed safe passage.He said:I’m in a situation where, frankly, night by night, day by day, we don’t know whether or not my mother-in-law and father-in-law, who have nothing to do, as most Gazans don’t, with Hamas or with any terror attack … will make it through the night or not.”He added: “We cannot sleep. We are constantly watching our phones.”Yousaf condemned the Hamas attack and said his concerns would be mirrored by Scotland’s Jewish community and their worries for family.“Innocent civilians” on both sides “are paying the price”, he added.9 Oct 20233:54PMIrish citizensThe Department of Foreign Affairs has said it is in contact with a “small number of Irish citizens” currently in Gaza and is “providing consular assistance as appropriate”.The official travel advice for Irish citizens in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank was updated over the weekend urging people to “avoid non-essential travel”.Any Irish citizen seeking to leave the region is being urged to contact their airline.In a statement this morning, a Foreign Affairs spokesperson said the department was “closely monitoring the situation in respect of Irish citizens in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt)”.“Our Embassy in Tel Aviv and our Representative Office in Ramallah, with support from our HQ consular team, are in ongoing contact with a significant number of citizens and are providing support,” the spokesperson added.“Anyone with concerns in relation to Irish citizens can contact the Department of Foreign Affairs on 01-4082000 or follow@dfatirl.“We also urge all citizens in Israel and the oPt to follow closely the consular advice issued by our Embassy in Tel Aviv and our Representative Office in Ramallah on X (formerly Twitter).”Update for 🇮🇪 citizens in Israel seeking to travel home: TLV Airport and many flights are operational.

But we don’t intend to comment specifically on the case at this stage.”9 Oct 20234:16PMThe United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have condemned the abduction of Israeli civilians by Hamas during its assault on Israel, calling for diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting.The Arab Muslim countries both established relations with Israel in 2020 as part of the US-brokered Abraham Accords.Their statements came after at least 100 hostages were seized in Saturday’s assault which left more than 700 people dead in Israel and triggered reprisal air strikes which have killed over 560 in Gaza.“The ministry stressed that attacks by Hamas against Israeli towns and villages near the Gaza Strip, including the firing of thousands of rockets at population centres, are a serious and grave escalation,” the UAE’s foreign ministry said in a statement last night.“The ministry is appalled by reports that Israeli civilians have been abducted as hostages from their homes.”The statement is notably less neutral than the UAE’s initial reaction on Saturday, which simply “expressed great concern regarding the escalation of violence between Israelis and Palestinians”.“The UAE expressed its condolences to the families of the victims and urges all diplomatic efforts to prevent a wider regional confrontation,” the latest statement said, warning against “nihilistic destruction”.Today, Bahrain’s foreign ministry followed suit, saying the “attacks launched by Hamas constitute a dangerous escalation”.“Bahrain denounces … the kidnapping of civilians from their homes as hostages,” the statement said, calling for immediate efforts to stop the fighting.9 Oct 20234:23PMIsraeli flag on European Commission buildingMinister Eamon Ryan and a number of Irish MEPs have said they do not agree with the projection of the Israeli flag on the European Commission building in Brussels over the weekend.Following Hamas’ Saturday attack, landmarks around Europe have been lit up with the blue and white flag of Israel in a show of solidarity.Among them, the flag was projected on the facade of Downing Street in London; the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin; and the Berlaymont building in Brussels which is home to the headquarters of the European Commission.Today, Hamas terrorists have struck at the heart of Israel capturing and killing innocent women and children.Israel has the right to defend itself -

The taking of hostages, including young children and the elderly is unconscionable. The must be released immediately”, he said.Martin said he yesterday wrote to Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen “to express our deep condolences”.The Tánaiste visited Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory and Jordan a number of weeks ago.“It is scarcely imaginable how the lives of so many people that I met during that visit will be irrevocably scarred by this violence,” he said.Martin said he is “working closely” with EU and international partners to “contribute to addressing this crisis”, including speaking with Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi.“These inhumane and senseless attacks have unleashed new horror upon innocent people in Israel and Gaza. Nothing could alleviate the heartbreak and outrage of those who have been affected by these events,” he said.“We now have a moral and political obligation to chart a way towards a future in which these events cannot be repeated.

EU reverses commissioner's decision to suspension of development aid payments to Palestinians,"LAST UPDATE|9 Oct 2023
THE EUROPEAN COMMISION has reversed its decision to suspend development aid payments to Palestinians, contradicting its commissioner for Neighbourhood and Engagement Oliver Varhelyi.
Earlier, Varhelyi posted on social media earlier that the EU is also placing €691 million of support “under review” after the Hamas assault on Israel.
“The scale of terror and brutality against Israel and its people is a turning point. There can be no business as usual,” Varhelyi posted.
“As the biggest donor of the Palestinians, the European Commission is putting its full development portfolio under review, worth a total of €691 million,” he added, in a message confirmed by a commission spokesman.
Varhelyi said the move meant “all payments immediately suspended. All projects put under review. All new budget proposals, including for 2023 postponed until further notice. Comprehensive assessment of the whole portfolio”.
The move was criticised by the Irish government as it believed there was “no legal basis” for the Commissioner’s “unilateral decision”.

EU foreign ministers are to hold emergency talks tomorrow on the situation in Israel and Gaza after the unprecedented attack by Hamas Islamist militants.
“Incitement to hatred, violence and glorification of terror have poisoned the minds of too many,” Varhelyi said. “We need action and we need it now.”
While the European Commission press service confirmed Varhelyi’s statement, it raised eyebrows in Brussels and in Ireland.
The Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement this evening that its “understanding is that there is no legal basis for a unilateral decision of this kind by an individual Commissioner”.

“We do not support a suspension of aid. We are formally requesting the Commission to clarify the legal basis for this announcement,” the Department said.
The Department added that “Ireland has a long-standing commitment tosupport humanitarian aid and development projects in the occupied Palestinian territory”.
“Irish funding provides emergency humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable, while also supporting the Palestinian Authority to deliver basic public services,” it said.
“Ireland has also consistently funded the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) which addresses the humanitarian and development needs of 5.7million Palestinian refugees,” the Department said.
It noted that currently up to 80% of the Palestinian population is “dependent on international assistance for basic human needs”.
Luxembourg’s acting foreign minister Jean Asselborn insisted that his government did not support the suspension of aid.
“Two million people live in Gaza. They are also hostages of Hamas. With these methods, we push them into the arms of terrorists,” he said.
“We are the largest donor to Gaza. This help is important for young people. This is not money for Hamas. It is for the people of Gaza,” he told AFP.
But the EU suspension is likely to be supported by other EU states, including the richest, Germany, which announced that it was suspending its own direct aid to the Palestinians.
“It is being examined, that is, temporarily suspended,” said a spokeswoman from the German ministry for economic cooperation and development.
Speaking to RTÉ Radio One’s Drivetime, Sinn Féin TD Matt Carthy said the suspension of aid is “an entirely cynical and unhelpful move”.
“My understanding is that it was a unilateral imposition of a Commissioner. I hope and expect that the Irish government and many others will strongly oppose such a move,” Carthy said.
“The suggest that the answer to this in any way lies with removing development aid to Palestine, to me, is bonkers,” he said.

Irish MEP Grace O’Sullivan has said she has been “horrified by the unfolding violence”.
“As a member of the European Parliament delegation to Palestine, I call on European leaders and institutions to focus all efforts on ending hostilities immediately, providing humanitarian assistance to victims and brokering a lasting two-state solution for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples without delay,” O’Sullivan said.
Sher said that “the European Commission’s decision to suspend all aid to Palestinians is a mistake in light of the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza where EU funding supports hospitals, schools and food security programmes”.
“As a neutral country with a recent history of conflict and reconciliation, Ireland has a particularly important role to play in ending the cycle of terror attacks and the systemic violence of the occupation,” O’Sullivan said.
“Ireland should engage with its international partners to deescalate the situation and prevent further loss of life.”
Spain has also said that it “disagrees” with a decision to suspend development aid.
“(Foreign Minister) Jose Manuel Albares, called European Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi to say he disagrees with this decision,” Spain’s foreign ministry said, adding that Albares called for this to be discussed at today’s meeting of European foreign ministers.
The EU announced in February that it was contributing €296 million for the 2022 budget year to help the Palestinian Authority pay civil servant salaries, pensions, medical services and fund infrastructure projects.
The bloc says it would provide “up to €1.177 billion in financial support from 2021 to 2024″.
A European Commission spokeswoman insisted earlier today that EU aid “does not fund Hamas or any other terrorist organisation activities, either directly or indirectly”.

Rally held outside Dáil in solidarity with Palestine,"A SOLIDARITY RALLY for Palestinians was held outside Dáil Éireann this evening by TDs and representatives from People Before Profit, the Union of Students in Ireland and The Irish Anti War Movement.
The rally was held after clashes between Israeli forces and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, following surprise attacks by the latter inside Israel starting early on Saturday morning.
The Irish Anti War Movement (IAWM) announced an emergency rally yesterday, to be held outside the Dáil today.
The rally condemned the “Israeli occupation and oppression” of Palestine and was backed by People Before Profit and the Union of Students in Ireland (USI).
Speaking to the crowd, which blocked off the junction between Molesworth Street and Kildare Street, a Palestinian living in Ireland, ‘Dr Ahmed’ said what is happening in Palestine is a “reaction” to years of oppression from Israel.
Dr Ahmed claimed that the Palestinian scenario is “more severe” than the war in Ukraine and believes it’s a “double standard” that the international community has supported Ukraine, and not Palestine.
Over 1,200 people have already been killed in violence in Israel and Gaza in the worst violence seen in the region since 2014.

This was after Hamas militants attacked and kidnapped thousands of Israeli citizens over the weekend, including a mass-shooting at a music festival of which Irish-Israeli woman Kim Damti (22) is among those who stillremain unaccounted for.
This morning, the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed it is in contacted with a “small number of Irish citizens in Gaza” and is providing support and consular assistance where required.
People Before Profit (PBP) TD Paul Murphy announced his support for the rally despite the Israeli ambassador to Ireland saying it wasa “shame” to see Irish politicians share and display Palestinian flags on social mediathis weekend.
Writing on X, formerly Twitter,today, Murphy said:”Stop the Attacks on Gaza! Free Palestine!”
As the crowd gathered outside the Dáil on Kildare Street, members of An Garda Síochána closed both ends of Kildare Street.
The crowd, holding signs and baring Palestinian flags, grew a sizable amount and blocked the junction between Kildare Street and Molesworth Street.

USI Vice President Zaid Al-Barghouthi, who himself is Palestinian, said the government must intervene to stop Israeli oppression.
Al-Barghouthi said while students are witnessing people their age lose their lives, people in government, through their relationships with the international community, have the power to stop that.
Speaking at the event, PBP TD Richard Boyd Barrett said: “This story did not begin two days ago,”
“This story began in Gaza, at least for the 18 years, but in reality since 1948. Decades of oppression, persecution, millions of Palestinians rotting in refugee camps, in the most horrendous conditions.

“That is the crime that has been done to the Palestinian people, and Israel is allowed do it, with impunity,” he added.
Sinn Féin TD and party leader Mary Lou McDonaldequally condemned the the targeting of the Gaza Strip and attacks on Israeli citizens by Hamas. She labelled the tactics by Hamas a breach of international law that must be condemned.
Speaking to RTÉ’s News At One today, McDonald added: “I have to say the the bombardment now of Gaza is equally to be condemned.”

Landmarks around Europe, including the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and Downing Street in London, have been lit up with the blue and white flag of Israel in a show of solidarity since Hamas’ attack on Saturday.
Additionally, theEuropean Union today suspended development aid payments to Palestine, a move that was criticised by Irish Green Party MEP Grace O’Sullivan.
The Gaza Strip, the compact home to 2.3 million Palestinian people, half of them children, is one of the most densely populated piece of land on earth, according to Amnesty International.
Previous attacks on the crammed region in the Middle East by Israeli forces has received criticism by many pro-Palestinian groups, including the IAWM who said it should be “no surprise as to why Palestinians may want to attack Israel”.
“As an anti-war and peace organisation we mourn the loss of all civilian life but we recognise that Palestinians have a legal right to defend themselves and fight back against continued attacks by the apartheid regime of Israel,” the group said in a statement yesterday.

What was happening between Israel and Palestine before Hamas attacked?,"THE ESCALATION OF conflict in Israel and Gaza took almost everyone by surprise.
On Saturday morning, Hamas – an Islamist group that controls the blockaded Palestinian enclave – launched thousands of rockets into Israel as militants stormed nearby towns in what were the first incursions into its territory since Israeli independence in 1948.
Hundreds of civilians were killed or taken hostage, including many who wereattending a music festival in the desert, and the events are already being dubbedIsrael’s 9/11.
Fighting is ongoing, with over 1,000 now dead, many more injured and 120,000 people in Gaza displaced. Israel plans to lay siege to Gaza, pledging to reduce it to ‘rubble’ amid fears of a humanitarian catastrophe.
But although the situation is unprecedented in the context of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the conditions that led to this uptick in fighting have been decades in the making, intensified by domestic flare-ups and political failures.
Palestinians have endured decades of hardship and have not achieved statehood despite numerous pledges and efforts at peace talks, though Saturday’s attacks were committed by an extremist group that does not represent all of its people.
As anyone who is remotely familiar with Middle Eastern politics will know, the conflict is one of the most intractable in the world, with both sides locked in an ongoing stalemate.
Thirty years ago, the world hoped that the signing of the Oslo Accords would prove a pivotal milestone in ending the conflict by paving the way for a two-state solution, with separate nations for Jews in Israel and Arabs in Palestine.
But the accords never materialised into anything tangible for the Palestinian side, while Israel continued to expand into territory earmarked for a Palestinian state without any rebuke from the West.
Millions of Palestinian refugees who were expelled from Israel during the first decades of the conflict – and their descendants – live abroad, many of them in refugee camps in the likes of nearby Jordan and Lebanon.
Israel refuses to entertain their so-called ‘right of return’ to properties and land which they were forcibly removed from during Israel’s war of independence in the late 1940s.
Nor will Israel acknowledge its role in causing the refugee problem, or compensate those who were forced to flee in the last number of decades.
Instead, it continues to occupy Palestinian territory and encourages Israeli settlers to go live there, in contravention of international law and amid criticism from the United Nations.
“Illegal settlement poses a corrosive threat to Israeli society as a whole, and unless Israeli forces abandon this dominant settler mindset and rightfully treat Palestinians in the occupied territory as protected persons, Israel’s deplorable record in the occupied West Bank will likely deteriorate further in 2023,”a group of UN experts said last year.
“No peaceful settlement [to the conflict] can be pursued under Israel’s repressive occupation: a reality that should be a wake-up call for all decision-makers.”
Palestinians who remain in the region have since been confined to two, non-contiguous enclaves in their former territory: the West Bank, which is occupied by Israel to its north-east; and the Gaza Strip, currently ruled by Hamas to the south-west.
More than 200 settlements have been constructed in the occupied West Bank since 1967, covering more than 10% of its territory. More than 100 of thesehave legal status under Israeli law.
The takeover of land by settlers not only deprives Palestinians of property rights and freedom of movement, but also impacts their ability to live and sustain their livelihoods by denying them access to water needed for things like livestock, irrigation and domestic consumption.
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have not been held since 2014, and the overall question of Palestinian nationhood and self-determination remains unresolved.
A series of agreements that would see the formation of a new state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel have not yet come to pass, and the issue has slipped down the agenda in Europe while the United States continues to enable Israel’s occupation.
The problem has also been exacerbated by the election of a far-right government in Israel, led by its longest-tenured prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Under Netanyahu’s 15 years of leadership, the peace process has stagnated and Israel has encroached further into the West Bank, particularly in areas with better land and access to resources and in part through policies which forcibly displace Palestinians living there.

Netanyahuhas pledgedthat there will be no Palestinian state while he is leader of Israel.
Without referencing Palestine, he has already signaled his intention to use the current conflict to “change the Middle East”.
“This is only the beginning… we are all with you and we will defeat them with force, enormous force,” he said today.

Emboldened by similar rhetoric from other Israeli ministers, violence against Palestinians has surged since last year: in 2022, a record number of Palestinians were killed at the hands of Israelis – a figure that looks set to be surpassed in 2023.
Earlier this year, there were pogroms in the northern West Bank town of Huwara, where Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians. Attempts by Palestinians to fight back were met with reprisal attacks by hundreds of Jewish settlers targeting locals and their property.
In Jenin refugee camp, home to more than 10,000 Palestinians who have been displaced in the West Bank, Israel conducted a series of raids earlier this year, breaking down houses and causing thousands of people to flee.
One of the biggest such raids in early July killed 13 Palestinians, including militants and children.
Meanwhile, recent tensions have centred on a sacred site in occupied East Jerusalem, known as the the Al-Aqsa Mosque to Muslim and as the Temple Mount to Jewish people.
In the past week, Israeli settlersentered the compoundat the site, with the army enforcing restrictions on Palestinians from entering and the closure of shops to allow Jewish prayers to take place.
Such instances are seen as humiliating for Palestinians, who feel goaded and disrespected by Israel.
In August, the far-right Public Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir typified the attitude of the government in remarks which backed settlers’ rights in the West Bank.
“My right, and that of my wife and children, to travel on the roads of Judea and Samaria [Israel's term for the West Bank], is more important than the freedom of movement of Arabs,” he said.
Amidst all of this has been a push by the Biden administration in the US to normalise relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a move which would follow the Abraham Accord agreements brokered by the Trump administration.
While some see it as helping to stabilise the region, the normalisation of relations between Israel and other Arab countries is seen by Palestinians as a betrayal, particularly as acceptance allows Israel to continue mistreating Palestine without rebuke.
Complicating the matter is the stance of Iran, a regional rival of Saudi Arabia and an enemy of both Israel and the United States.
The country’s president Ebrahim Raisi has denounced any attempts by regional countries to normalise relations with its Israel as “reactionary and regressive”.
At last month’s UN General Assembly, he also said any “relationships between regional countries and the Zionist regime would be a stab in the back of the Palestinians”.

Although Hamas cited recent events after Saturday’s attack - it’s no coincidence that the operation was dubbed Al-Aqsa Storm after the mosque in east Jerusalem – it is not fully known why the group chose to attack when it did.
It also seems unlikely that such a huge operation would simply be a response to recent events, given the need to stockpile rockets and speculation about the choice of date – exactly 50 years since the Yom Kippur war between Israel and other Arab countries.
What is known is that the attack followed years of stagnation in the conflict, during which Palestinians suffered daily without any hope of a solution, and that Hamas claims it wanted to send a message, citing the West Bank occupation and Al-Aqsa Mosque.
The leader of the group’s military wing, Muhammad Deif, said in a recorded statement that the group launched its operation so that “the enemy will understand that the time of their rampaging without accountability has ended”.
The situation for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip – the area ruled by Hamas – is particularly bleak.

The impoverished enclave has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007, and is one of the most densely populated places on the planet, with more than two million people living in a 362-square-kilometre area – which is even smaller than Co Louth.
Around half of its population is under 18, and there are harsh restrictions on movement of goods and people into and out of the region, with virtually no industry and a chronic lack of water, fuel and electricity.
Israel imposed an air, land and sea blockade in 2006 when an Israeli soldier, was captured by Hamas - an Islamist group funded by Iran which Israel, the United States and the EU classify as a terrorist group.
Over the years Hamas has launched numerous rocket attacks on Israel, which is protected by sophisticated missile defence systems, prompting airstrikes on Gaza in retaliation leading to the deaths of Palestinian civilians.
Tensions have flared to such an extent that Israel has fought four wars in Gaza Strip since its 2005 withdrawal: in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021.
These wars have killed more than 4,000 people on the Palestinian side, many of them civilians, compared to around 100 Israelis.
Israel also carries out occasional pre-emptive strikes in Gaza, targeting Hamas militants in a way that aims to curtail the group’s activities without getting into a full-scale war – a phenomenonknown as ‘mowing the grass’by Israel and in the US.

Despite all of this, efforts to resolve the conflict have fallen down the international agenda in recent years, particularly with such a focus now on the situation in Ukraine.
When Micheál Martin visited Israel and Palestine last month, he told reporters that he had hoped to re-kindle support at a European level for the two-state solution.
But Europe is not the most influential power when it comes to the conflict.
Over the decades, Israel’s greatest ally has been the United States, and it is the greatest cumulative recipient of US military aid.It received $3 billion from the US last year alone.
President Joe Biden reaffirmed his stance at the weekend,saying that the US stood byin support whatever response Israel had to the actions of Hamas.
“Israel has a right to defend itself and its people,” he said. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”
And although there has been low-level friction between Biden and Netanyahu during the former’s term in office over Israeli expansion into the West Bank, the US president has nevertheless continued the policy of ignoring the Palestinian cause.
He has been in the background pushing for the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia – a move which analysists believe would hurt the Palestinians – and there have been no attempts by his administration to get peace talks back on the agenda.
Recent remarks appear to show a complacency about the situation.
“The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades,” Biden’s national security advisersaid last week.
Leaving aside the situation in Gaza, there is already speculation that this could be incredibly wide of the mark, with both Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah praising the Hamas attack.
Hezbollah launched guided missiles and artillery shells from Israel’s north on Sunday “in solidarity” with Hamas, in what some observers considered a warning shot.
At the moment, it remains unclear how the next few days will play out, though it is likely that the situation in Gaza will deteriorate and that there will be more deaths.
Given recent history, it should come as no surprise if things escalate even further.

'Battle of flags doesn't help’: Irish politicians condemn Israeli flag on EU Commission building,"A GOVERNMENT MINISTER and two MEPs have said they do not agree with the projection of the Israeli flag on the European Commission building in Brussels over the weekend.
Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Andrews said the display of the flag on the building was “an overreach” while Independent MEP Clare Daly said that Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had “gone far beyond the powers afforded to her”.
Transport Minister Eamon Ryan said that a “battle of flags and emblems isn’t exactly going to help”.
Landmarks around Europe, including the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and Downing Street in London, have been lit up with the blue and white flag of Israel in a show of solidarity since Hamas’s attack on Saturday.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted a photo of the Berlaymont building in Brussels, home to the headquarters of the European Commission, lit up with the projection of the Israeli flag. In the accompanying caption, she wrote:
“Today, Hamas terrorists have struck at the heart of Israel capturing and killing innocent women and children. Israel has the right to defend itself – today and in the days to come.
“The European Union stands with Israel.”
At least 700 people were killed in southern Israel on Saturday when Hamas militants stormed out of Gaza and attacked Israeli settlements in anunprecedented surprisestrike.
In Gaza, the health ministry in the Palestinian enclave said that “560 people were killed and another 2,900 injured” in Israeli strikes in retaliation.

Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Andrews was unequivocal in his view that the projection of the flag onto the Commission Building was inappropriate and said Ireland’s stance on Israel-Palestine was “clearly at odds” with President von der Leyen.
He added that doing so was “undoubtedly an overreach” by the Commission.
Andrews toldThe Journal: “I do not believe it was appropriate to display the Israeli flag on the European Commission building, not only because this is a highly divisive conflict, but especially because the European Commission has no authority as regards the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy.”
He said foreign policy is a competence of Member States who are collectively represented by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, alongside the President of the European Council Charles Michel.
“The official EU stance on this conflict is in support of a negotiated two state solution and I don’t believe that displaying one side’s flag moves us closer to this goal, nor does it equate to solidarity with those affected,” he said.
The Journalasked Andrews if Ireland was at odds with the EU in relation to the Israel-Palestine issue to which he responded:

“In the Council, Ireland’s stance is shared by some other Member States, but Ireland is clearly at odds with President Von Der Leyen on the matter. As such, the issue is not as simple as Ireland versus EU.”
Andrews added that he condemned the “attacks and terrorism” by Hamas since Saturday morning in the same way he has “continuously condemned the Israeli government for its illegal occupation and annexation of Palestine as well as the crimes against Palestinians”.
“Attacks on citizens are a breach of international law, no matter which side they are from,” he said.
“We must express our solidarity with both the Israeli and Palestinian people whose lives have been upturned by the recent escalation. However, this does not mean legitimising either the actions of the Israeli government, or Hamas, who do not represent Palestine.”
On Ursula von der Leyen’s assertion that Israel “has the right to defend itself – today and in the days to come”, Andrews said he would be reluctant to support Israeli retaliation.
“I have been appalled at the actions of the Netanyahu government in Gaza and the West Bank, which include illegal occupation, torture, civilian killings and countless other violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, so I would be reluctant to support Israeli retaliation under Netanyahu’s leadership.
“Ultimately, the current situation reflects a gross failure of leadership on both sides, as well as internationally,” he said.
Looking ahead, Andrews said Ireland’s priority must be pushing for an immediate ceasefire and a negotiated two-state solution.
He said Ireland has an opportunity to advocate on behalf of Palestinian civilians but that “we must be careful not equate Hamas with Palestine, nor to support the narrative that terrorism is an essential part of any resistance, otherwise the European Union will become deeply polarized and Ireland risks badly damaging its reputation”.
Independent MEP Clare Daly toldThe Journalthat von der Leyen has “gone far beyond the powers afforded to her”.
Daly’s retweet criticising von der Leyen’s message has been liked over 96,000 times, including by fellow MEP Luke Ming Flanagan.

“There is no unanimous agreement across the 27 Member States on the unqualified, unconditional support for the Israeli government expressed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen over the weekend.
“In that sense, the President of the European Commission, who was appointed as the head of Europe’s civil service, is at odds with the Council, which is made up of democratically elected governments,” Daly said.
She added that she believes the lighting up of the European Commission building with the Israeli flag is not just inappropriate but “grotesque” and calls into question the credibility of the EU.
She also pointed out that the same has never been done with the Palestinian flag following acts of Israeli violence.
Daly said: “The state of Israel’s murderous violence against Palestinians is well-known and well-documented, as is the fact that Israel is an apartheid state responsible for a catalogue of war crimes over decades, and a state which has zero regard for international law.
“For the European Commission to express unqualified support for Israel, at this time, in the full knowledge that Israel will carry out heinous acts of violence against Palestinians in retaliation for Saturday’s attacks by Hamas, is reckless, it is irresponsible, and it is yet another hammer blow to the credibility of the European Union.”

In addition to this, Daly said it is “completely inappropriate and reckless” for von der Leyen to offer Israel “carte blanche and unconditional support for anything they may do in the future”.
Daly pointed to the declaration of a siege of Gaza by Israel earlier today which will cut off all electricity, food and fuel supplies.
“An untold number of innocent people will suffer horribly because of this; many will die,” Daly said.
Daly agreed with Andrews that Ireland has a unique opportunity to advocate on behalf of Palestinian civilians and said this must be seized by our government.
“In the days and weeks to come, the Irish government and Irish diplomats must stand firm in support of peace, de-escalation and international law, and against those reckless voices who only seek to feed the cycle of violence,” she said.
Eamon Ryan
Speaking to reporters in Dublin this afternoon, Transport Minister and leader of the Green Party, Eamon Ryan said a “battle of flags and emblems isn’t exactly going to help”.
“I think it is a moment for slightly calm heads and trying to dial down a lot of the tensions, of any flags,” Ryan said.
He pointed to the lessons learned from the Troubles in Northern Ireland and said:
“Well firstly we condemn terrorist violence but also we stand up for Constitutional Rights, and it’s a very hard balance to make.
“But I think we in our country have been good at that. One of the things we’ve learned is maybe a battle of flags and emblems isn’t exactly going to help.”
Ryan said he “unreservedly condemns what has happened in Israel in recent days” and said Ireland remains very supportive of the Palestinian cause which he said has been “deeply harmed and damaged by the actions of Hamas”.
“We all know, the Irish government have been very strong in also calling out the lack of action from the Israeli government to address the rights and the right cause of the Palestinian people.
“But that can’t be a reason to be unequivocal in terms of what is an absolute and utter tragedy and a crime in the killing of those people,” Ryan said.
He added that the occupation of Palestine and the injustice that the Palestinian people have suffered “cannot be an excuse for terrorism” but said that Ireland’s position on seeking to recognise Palestinian statehood remains unchanged.
“To condemn one does not undermine the case for the other,” he said.
So far, over 1,200 people have already been killed since Saturday in Israel and Gaza.

"The targeting of civilians and hostage taking by Hamas 'is to be condemned outright', says McDonald","MARY LOU MCDONALD HAS said the targeting of civilians and the taking of hostages by Hamas “is to be condemned outright”.
Speaking to RTE’s News At One and referring to slaying of around 250 people who attended an outdoor music festival in an Israeli community near Gaza at the weekend, the Sinn Fein leader said to see young people out  enjoying themselves and meeting “such a violent and traumatic death is just truly horrific”.
“I understand perfectly the sense of trauma that’s been expressed,” she added.
“What happened at the weekend in terms of targeting civilians and hostage taking is not on,” said McDonald, calling it a breach of international law that must be condemned.
She went on to state:
Over 1,200 people have already been killed in violence in Israel and Gaza in the worst violence seen in the region since 2014.
At least 700 people were killed in southern Israel when Hamas militants stormed out of Gaza on Saturday and attack Israeli settlements.
Following two days of retaliatory air strikes, Israeli Defence Minister has ordered a “complete siege” on the Gaza Strip, while EU foreign ministers will tomorrow hold urgent talks on the situation
Giving her reaction today, McDonald said:
“My feeling overall in this scenario is one of alarm because this is now a very, very dangerous situation, but also a feeling a very, very deep frustration, because the truth is, that for decades, the Israeli state has breached international law”.
She said Israel has continued with collective punishment, annexation, confiscation of lands, and the imposing an apartheid regime while “denying the Palestinian people their absolute legitimate right rise to self determination”.

McDonald said she feels there is a depressing predictability now about the intensification of the conflict.
None of the behaviour of Israel could justify the action of Hamas, McDonald said, repeating that she would not justify the targeting of civilians and the taking of hostages.
The Sinn Fein party leader was asked if she endorses a tweet by Sinn Fein TD Chris Andrews, in which he said: “It seems that according to the #EU and #Ireland only Palestine has no right to defend itself against murder, torture and Apartheid…”.
“My colleague Chris Andrews is quite correct to call out the fact that the international community has consistently looked the other way,” said McDonald, while saying that she had not seen the tweet by her party colleague.
The lack of response from the international community to conflict situation in the region has made a “very, very difficult and dangerous situation all the more difficult and all the more dangerous”, she said.
She highlighted that the Secretary General of the United Nations António Guterres had raised the “hardline” approach taken by the Israeli government, in the form of the extension of settlements.
When asked if the action of Hamas is an act of defence, in her view, McDonald said:
McDonald also stated that she has visited the West Bank in the past to meet all sides, including the Hamas leadership.
“That’s the correct way to approach this,” she said, adding:
“We should know in Ireland, if you’re serious, and that’s the thing, if you’re serious about achieving a ceasefire, which is necessarily, a path to peace and respect for international law in a conflict situation you meet and talk to everybody, because that’s the only way that you can find a pathway forward.”
Ireland can be very constructive and influential in dealing with these matter, said McDonald. Ireland should not stand idly by, she added.
The people of Palestine have endured bombardment and impoverishment for years, said McDonald who said the international community “has not alone looked the other way but in some ways, they have facilitated the breach of international law”.
“I couldn’t stand over that. I think that is wrong. I know that across all of the Oireachtas there is a widespread consensus in terms of the need to recognise the Palestinian State in terms of condemnation of annexation and confiscation of Palestinian lands.

“Ireland actually has a good analysis of the problem. What I would like us to do now is to move towards action and suppress our international partners, not to simply stand idly by this situation,” McDonald concluded.
Just over two weeks ago in the UN in New York, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his General Assembly speech, stating that the international community had failed in its regard.
“It should not be so – we have known for decades the parameters of the only just solution: a two-State solution, with a viable Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, living in peace and security alongside the State of Israel, whose right to exist should be accepted and respected by all its neighbours.
“We have affirmed and reaffirmed this many times. Yet, day after day, developments take us further from this vision and make a two-state solution harder to handle.
“We see acts of terrorism perpetrated against Israeli and Palestinian civilians; increasingly dangerous and provocative rhetoric; and clear violations of international law,” he said in his speech.
Varadkar spoke about the need to promote peace and reconciliation, stating that Ireland “wholeheartedly” agreed with a resolution passed by the General Assembly seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences arising from Israel’s prolonged occupation.
Clarification of international law can only strengthen international peace and security, he said at the time.
Meanwhile, there have been calls for statements in the Dail this week on the issues.
Social Democrats Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Gary Gannon has written to the Ceann Comhairle and the Oireachtas Business Committee requesting time be set aside in the Dáil this week to discuss the escalating violence in Israel and Gaza.
“The Government must facilitate statements in the Dáil this week on the deteriorating situation in Israel and Gaza. The violence that has erupted over the weekend is shocking, frightening and hugely concerning.
“The answer to barbarity by Hamas is not further human rights abuses and breaches of international law by Israel. Missile strikes on densely populated areas, that civilians are unable to flee, is a breach of international law.
“The announcement that Israel is going to begin a complete blockade of Gaza – with no electricity, no food and no fuel allowed to enter the strip – is inhumane and unacceptable. Collective punishment of more than two million people – 50 per cent of whom are children – is a war crime and cannot not be tolerated,” he said.

Israeli NGO says up to 250 people killed at music festival attacked by Hamas,"LAST UPDATE|9 Oct 2023

HAMAS MILITANTS KILLED around 250 people who attended an outdoor music festival in an Israeli community near Gaza at the weekend, a volunteer who helped collect the bodies said today.
The Supernova music festival took place on Saturday near Kibbutz Re’im, a remote area in southern Israel close to Gaza.
Thousands are estimated to have been in attendance when Hamas militants stormed Israel on motorbikes, pickup trucks, speed boats and motorised gliders, some of which were seen flying over the festival in a video widely shared online.
Festival-goers were seen fleeing for their lives across an open field towards cars as gunshots were heard, in other footage that AFP was unable to immediately verify.
While many were killed, at least 100 people were taken hostage, with a video of 25-year-old woman, Noa Argamani, reportedly crying for help from the back of a motorbike while being kidnapped spreading across social media.
“They just went and gunned down people in the cars,” Moti Bukjin, a spokesman for the humanitarian organisation Zaka, which helped to recover bodies from the area, told AFP.
The religious NGO specialises in collecting bodies in accordance with Jewish law.
“In the area where the party took place, and at the party itself” he estimated that “there were 200-250 bodies,” based on the number of trucks used to ferry away the corpses.
That grim assessment means the number of dead at the festival accounts for more than a third of the overall death toll from the Hamas assault, which the Israeli army put at over 700.
However, the total figure of those killed at the festival is expected to be higher as other paramedic teams work in the area.
In the ensuing Israeli air strikes, at least 560 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip, according to the health ministry there.
Bukjin said he had been a volunteer at Zaka for 28 years and “thought I reached my end” after working at a deadly stampede in Meron during a religious festival two years ago.
“I thought it was the end of the world” but “it turns out things can be much, much worse,” he said in a phone call with AFP as he prepared to continue the recovery work for Zaka.
“They butchered people in cold blood in an inconceivable way,” he said of what he saw at the site of the music festival.
On a major road nearby, “there were cars on the side of the road, an overturned car, a car on its side –- in each car there were two or three bodies or just one body shot dead,” he said.
Aerial footage obtained by AFP of the aftermath of the attack showed dozens of burned-out cars on the side of the road leading out from the festival site.
Bukjin said all the bodies he handled were of people who had been shot dead, with the militants killing them by shooting them in the head or by torching their cars.

“What’s shocking is that they confirmed the people they shot were dead. They had so much time till the security forces got there. Some of the cars they burnt with people inside,” he said.
“On some we saw a gunshot to the head, a bullet to the head, a bullet in the chin. It’s not randomly spraying bullets and hoping they hit.”
Festival-goers who tried to escape on foot were among the dead.
“Some of the bodies were in ditches, they were shot trying to flee and fell into the ditches on the side of the road,” he said.
The conversation with Bukjin took place as the army announced its forces had regained control of the communities near Gaza from Hamas fighters.
Bukjin said that only now would Zaka begin collecting the bodies from those communities, including the elderly, children and babies.
“It’s going to be a rough day,” he said gravely.
One festivalgoer hasdescribed to the BBC how she hid under a tree in a nearby field as gunmen continued their attacks.
“The terrorists were coming from four or five places,” Gili Yoskovich said. “So we didn’t know whether to go here, so then I got into my car again and I drove a little bit more.
“Some people were shooting at me. I left the car and started to run, I saw a place with many pomelo trees and I went there.”
She added: “They were going tree by tree and shooting. Everywhere. From two sides. I saw people were dying all around. I was very quiet. I didn’t cry, I didn’t do anything.”
22-year-old Irish-Israeli woman Kim Damti is among those who remains unaccounted for following the attack on the music festival.
Her mother Jenniferhas appealed for information on her daughter’s whereabouts, telling US outlet ABC News: “All I can think about is where she is, if she’s suffering, if she’s still alive. I just want her back.”
Jake Marlowe, 26, who moved to Israel from Britain two years ago, is believed to have been taken hostage while providing security at the music festival.
His mother Lisa told the Jewish News site that he called her “to say all these rockets were flying over,” and then later to tell her “signal very bad, everything OK, will keep you updated I promise you”.
Israel’s ambassador to Britain said there was one British citizen in Gaza, without naming the person.
Meanwhile, Brazil’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that three dual Brazilian-Israeli nationals were missing after attending the music festival and a fourth was being treated in hospital.

"Israel's Defence Minister orders 'complete siege' of Gaza, says 'we are fighting animals'","LAST UPDATE|9 Oct 2023

[Note: You can follow latest developments on the warin our liveblog]
ISRAELI DEFENCE MINISTER Yoav Gallant has ordered a “complete siege” on the Gaza Strip as the military pounded the Palestinian enclave with air strikes.
“We are putting a complete siege on Gaza… No electricity, no food, no water, no gas — it’s all closed,” Gallant said in a video statement, referring to the crowded enclave home to 2.3 million people.
“We are fighting animals and are acting accordingly,” Gallant said in Hebrew.
Israel relentlessly pounded the Gaza Strip overnight as fighting raged with Hamas around the Gaza Strip and the death toll from the war against the Palestinian militants surged to above 1,200.
Thick plumes of smoke billowed from the Palestinian enclave as the strikes continued in the early hours of the morning, an AFP correspondent reported.
Anti-rocket sirens followed by the sound of blasts were heard in Jerusalem, as Israel’s army battled Hamas militants in southern towns for the third consecutive day.
It came two days after Hamas launched a barrage of rockets and sent a wave of fighters who gunned down civilians and took at least 100 hostages in an massive attack that took Israel by surprise.
On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to turn parts of Gaza “into ruins” following the surprise attack by Hamas launched from Gaza.
The Hamas attack has so far killed more than 700 Israelis.
Hamas militants fired thousands of rockets and sent dozens of fighters into Israeli towns near the Gaza Strip in an unprecedented early morning attack during a major Jewish holiday on Saturday.
Tens of thousands of Israeli forces were deployed to battle holdout Hamas fighters where the bodies of civilians had been found strewn on roads and in town centres.
The number of Hamas fighters involved in the initial incursion underscored the extent of planning by the militant group ruling Gaza, which has said it launched the attack in response to mounting Palestinian suffering under Israel’s occupation and blockade of Gaza.
Israel’s army said today it had regained control of southern areas near the Gaza Strip amid gun battles with Hamas fighters.
“We are in control of the communities,” said military spokesman Daniel Hagari, cautioning that individual Palestinian “terrorists” may remain in the region where Israel was massing tens of thousands of troops and heavy armour.

The Israeli rescue service Zaka said its paramedics removed about 260 bodies from a music festival attended by thousands who were attacked.

The death toll in the Gaza Strip rose to 560 on Monday, the health ministry in the Palestinian enclave said, as Israel pounded Hamas targets for the third consecutive day.
The Hamas-controlled ministry said “570 people were killed and another 2,900 injured” in the fighting that began on Saturday after Hamas militants fired thousands of rockets in Israel in a surprise dawn assault.
Around 2,000 people have been wounded on each side.

The Israeli strikes hit numerous multi-storey buildings, including the home of Rawhi Mushtaha, a member of the Hamas political bureau, the army said.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said a school sheltering more than 225 people took a direct hit.
TheAssociated Press reports that in one strikeon a refugee camp 19 members of the same family were killed.
The United Nations says the number of displaced people in Gaza has risen to more than 123,000 as a result of the fighting between Israel’s military and Hamas.
By late Sunday, retaliatory Israeli airstrikes in response to Hamas attacks had destroyed 159 housing units across Gaza and severely damaged 1,210 others, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Israel – which declared war on Hamas on Sunday – hit more than 800 targets in Gaza in response, their military said, including airstrikes that levelled much of the town of Beit Hanoun in the enclave’s northeast corner.

“Our task is to make sure that Hamas will no longer have any military capabilities to threaten Israel with this,” said spokesperson Jonathan Conricus in a video tweeted by Israel’s military.
“And in addition to that, we will make sure that Hamas is no longer able to govern the Gaza Strip.”
Captives
Meanwhile, Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad group claimed to have taken captive more than 130 people from inside Israel and brought them into Gaza, saying they would be traded to release thousands of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
The Israeli military said only that the number of captives is “significant.”
Israel has carried out major military campaigns over the past four decades in Lebanon and Gaza that it portrayed as wars, but without a formal declaration.
The Security Cabinet also approved “significant military steps.”
The steps were not defined, but the declaration appears to give the military and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a wide mandate.
In a statement, Netanyahu’s office said the aim will be the destruction of Hamas’ “military and governing capabilities” to an extent that prevents it from threatening Israelis “for many years.”
Department of Foreign Affairs
The official travel advice for Irish citizens in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank was updated over theweekend urging people to “avoid non-essential travel”.

Timeline: Here is what has happened in Israel and Gaza since Saturday,"
ISRAEL HAS MASSED tens of thousands of troops around the Gaza Strip today, as gunfights rage between Hamas and Israeli forces, two days after the Islamist militants attacked Israel.
More than 1,100 people have been killed on both sides since the Iran-backed Hamas launched the massive assault at dawn on Saturday, which the Israeli army dubbed “by far the worst day” in the country’s history.
This is what we know about the conflict so far:
How it unfolded
The Israeli Army said hundreds of Hamas militants attacked Israel from around 6.30am local time on Saturday (around 4.30am Irish time), the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah.
Muhammad Deif, the leader of the military wing of Hamas, said the group had decided to launch an “operation” so that “the enemy will understand that the time of their rampaging without accountability has ended”.
The assault also came 50 years and one day after the outbreak of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.
Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel from Gaza as its militants used explosives and bulldozers to break through the fence surrounding the blockaded Palestinian enclave.
Using motorbikes, pickup trucks, motorised gliders and speed boats, the militants streamed into Israeli urban areas including Ashkelon, Sderot and Ofakim, which is about 22 kilometres from Gaza.
Shortly after 7.30am local time (5.30am Irish time), the Israel Defence Forces confirmed that Hamas fighters had crossed from Gaza into southern Israel.
The scale of the attack became clear with air raid sirens going off in major cities such as Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
Shortly after 10.30am local time (8.30am Irish time), Israel started to strike targets in Gaza.
How Israel is responding
In a press statement on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was “at war” with Hamas.
“We are at war, not in an operation or in rounds, but at war,” the Israeli leader said in a statement, adding Hamas had launched a “murderous surprise attack” on Israel and its people.
“I have ordered an extensive mobilisation of reserves and that we return fire of a magnitude that the enemy has not known. The enemy will pay an unprecedented price,” he said.

Netanyahu later warned Palestinians living near Hamas sites in Gaza to leave as he vowed to turn its hideouts into “rubble” in an operation it has dubbed Swords of Iron.
“I’m telling the people of Gaza: get out of there now, because we’re about to act everywhere with all our force,” he said in a brief televised statement.
Israel said Hamas has taken more than 100 hostages in Israel to date. They include an unknown number of Americans and Germans.
The gunmen also carried out a bloody attack on a music festival attended by hundreds of young Israelis and foreigners near Kibbutz Reim, close to Gaza.
Irish-Israeli woman Kim Damti (22) is among those whoremains unaccounted forfollowing the attack on the festival.
Today the Israeli army declared its forces were now “in control” of the southern communities attacked by Hamas gunmen. The army said it struck 500 Hamas and Islamic Jihad sites overnight, after carrying out 800 previously.
It has massed tens of thousands of troops and heavy armour near Gaza, with Palestinians bracing for a potential ground assault.
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant today ordered a “complete siege” on Gaza.
“We are putting a complete siege on Gaza… No electricity, no food, no water, no gas — it’s all closed,” Gallant said in a video statement, referring to the crowded enclave home to around two million people.
“We are fighting animals and are acting accordingly,” Gallantsaid in Hebrew.
The United Nations said more than 123,000 people have been displaced inside Gaza since the outbreak of violence.
Israel has maintained a land, air and sea blockade on Gaza since 2007 that has had a devastating effect on Palestinian civilians.
What Hamas says about the offensive
Hamas said it fired 5,000 rockets in an offensive it has branded Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.
Its chief Ismail Haniyeh on Saturday vowed to press ahead with “the battle to liberate our land and our prisoners languishing in occupation prisons”.
Hamas has called on “resistance fighters in the West Bank” as well as in “Arab and Islamic nations” to join the battle.
Early on Sunday, Lebanon’s Iran-backed Shiite militant group Hezbollah said it launched missiles and artillery shells into northern Israel “in solidarity” with the Hamas offensive.
The Israeli army said it retaliated with artillery fire.

Elsewhere, media outlets in Egypt said a policeman opened fire on an Israeli tour group in the northern city of Alexandria on Sunday, killing two Israelis and one Egyptian.
More than 1,100 killed
Israel says Hamas gunmen have killed more than 700 people and wounded over 2,000 in Israeli cities, towns and kibbutz communities.
AFP journalists have seen the bullet-riddled bodies of civilians lying on the streets in at least three locations in Israel: the city of Sderot, the nearby kibbutz of Gevim and Zikim beach north of the Palestinian coastal enclave.
An estimated 250 people were killed at the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Reim, a volunteer who helped recover the bodies for the said.
“They butchered people in cold blood in an inconceivable way,” Moti Bukjin, a spokesman for the humanitarian organisation Zaka, said.
On the Gaza side, health officials said at least 430 people had been killed and more than 2,200 wounded, taking the combined toll to more than 1,100 dead.
The United States said at least four Americans were killed, with the toll likely to rise. A Briton, 12 Thais and 10 Nepalis are among other foreigners killed.
How Ireland and the world has reacted
Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister Micheál Martin on Saturday said he“fears for” people in Gazaas Israel retaliates after an attack by militant group Hamas.
“This was in my view an appalling attack by Hamas, and one which they know the consequences [of] as well,” he told reporters ahead of the Fianna Fáil President’s Dinner in Dublin.
“I fear for people in Gaza in terms because we’ve seen what has happened before and there needs to be a political will towards a political solution.”
Martin earlier condemned the attacks on X, formerly Twitter, calling for an immediate end to the violence.
“I strongly condemn the firing of rockets into Israel by Hamas and attacks against Israel from Gaza. I deeply regret the loss of life and the impact on civilians. I call for an immediate cessation of all hostilities,” Martin posted.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned “in the strongest terms” Hamas’ attack on Israel and called for “diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflagration”.
US President Joe Biden said the United States’ support for its key ally Israel was “rock solid and unwavering”. The White House said on Sunday he had ordered “additional support” for Israel and moved an aircraft carrier group to the eastern Mediterranean.

'I just want her back': Mother of missing Irish-Israeli woman appeals for information,"THE MOTHER OF an Irish-Israeli woman who is missing after Hamas militants launched an unprecedented series of surprise attacks on Saturday has expressed fears for her daughter’s safety.
22-year-old Kim Damti remains unaccounted for having been attending a music festival when the attack occurred.
Her mother Jennifer has said the family last heard from Kim at around 6.30am on Saturday when the attack began. After telling her to find shelter, they have not heard from her since.
Speaking toUS outlet ABC Newsfrom her home in Tel Aviv, Jennifer described waiting to hear news about her daughter.
“You can’t sleep. All I can think about is where she is, if she’s suffering, if she’s still alive. I just want her back,” she said.

She said Kim did not realise that there were “seven or eight Toyota vans full of terrorists” at the music festival when the attack took place.
“They just shot everywhere. They just shot them, slaughtered them like ducks, and that’s the reason I’m here, because I want the world to condemn this behaviour. I didn’t bring my children up to hate anybody.”
The Department of Foreign Affairs has been in touch with Kim’s family and is providing consular assistance.
Around 500 targets were struck in Gaza by Israeli forces overnight following Hamas attacks on Israel that have so far killed over 700.
Speaking yesterday, Tánaiste and foreign affairs minister Micheál Martin confirmed that the Government was aware of Kim’s case and had been in touch with the family.
“Could I say that as more information is revealed, I think the full horror of the crimes that were committed yesterday by Hamas are laid bare – hundreds and hundreds of innocent people slaughtered in the most savage of ways,” he said.
He said that people had been targeted in their homes in an “indiscriminate” way.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the attack launched by Hamas is “probably the worst attack that Israel has had to endure for 40 years now”.
“The government condemns it unreservedly, there can be no excuse for targeting women, children, taking children and women, civilians as hostage,” he said.
“I don’t think anyone could do anything other than condemn that and we do condemn it unreservedly.”
He also urged restraint by the Israeli authorities, adding that while the “free world is standing in solidarity with Israel”, an excessive response which results in unnecessary civilian deaths in Gaza could change that.

"Two Israeli tourists, local guide shot dead by Egypt policeman","
AN EGYPTIAN POLICEMAN shot dead two Israeli tourists and their Egyptian guide yesterday, local media and Israeli authorities said, as war raged for a second day between Israel and Palestinian militants.
Israel’s National Security Council later said its citizens should consider not travelling abroad particularly in the Middle East “on the backdrop of the attack in Egypt.”
It said visitors already in Egypt should leave “as soon as possible.”
The policeman fired “at random” at an Israeli tour group visiting Alexandria using “his personal weapon”, the state-affiliated private television Extra News said, quoting a security source.
A fourth person was wounded and the policeman was “immediately arrested”, it added.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry confirmed the deaths in a statement.
“This morning during a visit of Israeli tourists in Alexandria, Egypt, a local opened fire at them, murdering two Israeli citizens and their Egyptian guide,” it said.
“In addition, there is a wounded Israeli in moderate condition.”
Israel’s National Security Council added “there is a fear of a rise in motivation of terror groups and lone assailants” who could carry out attacks on Israelis abroad.
Cairo had not immediately commented on the attack against the tourists.
The deaths came as fighting raged after Palestinian militants on Saturday launched a multi-pronged attack on Israel, which has declared war on the Hamas movement and launched air strikes on Gaza.
Egypt was the first Arab country to forge a peace deal with Israel in 1979, and has long served as an intermediary between Israel and the Palestinians.

"Close to 1,000 people dead between both sides as Israel officially declares war","LAST UPDATE|8 Oct 2023

ISRAEL FORMALLY DECLARED war on Hamas today as the conflict’s death toll surged close to 1,000 after the Palestinian militant group launched a massive surprise assault from Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu steeled the shocked and grieving nation for a “long and difficult” war ahead after Hamas fired a barrage of rockets at Israel on Saturday and sent in fighters who gunned down civilians and took at least 100 hostages.
The United States today said it will provide munitions and equipment to Israel and boost American forces in the Middle East in response to the attacks by Hamas.
“The United States government will be rapidly providing the Israel Defense Forces with additional equipment and resources, including munitions,” US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement.
The US defence chief also said he had directed the USS Gerald R. Ford, an aircraft carrier, and its accompanying warships to the eastern Mediterranean, and that Washington was augmenting fighter aircraft squadrons in the region.
Meanwhile, major airlines cancelled dozens of flights to Tel Aviv this weekend, with American Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates and Ryanair are among those pulling flights to Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport.
The bloody escalation sharply heightened Middle East tensions and killed more than 600 people on the Israeli side, the country’s worst losses since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war when it came under attack from a coalition led by Egypt and Syria.
“Israel was caught flat-footed by the unprecedented attack,” said Jonathan Panikoff, director of the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative.
“I’ve heard multiple comparisons to 9/11, and many Israelis are struggling to understand how this could have happened.”
In Gaza – which was hammered by Israeli air strikes on 800 targets ahead of what many feared may be a looming ground invasion – officials reported at least 370 deaths, with thousands more wounded across the war zone.
Tens of thousands of Israeli forces were deployed to battle holdout Hamas fighters in the south, where the bodies of civilians had been found strewn on roads and in town centres.
“The enemy is still on the ground,” said military spokesman Daniel Hagari as a second night fell after the attack, adding that Israel was reinforcing its military strength near the Gaza Strip.
Gun battles raged as the Israeli army sought to secure desert regions near the coastal enclave, rescue Israeli hostages and evacuate all areas near Gaza.
“We’ll reach each and every community until we kill every terrorist in Israel,” vowed Hagari, a day after Hamas fighters launched their shock offensive and surged into Israel using vehicles, boats and even motorised paragliders.
There was widespread shock and dismay in Israel after at least 100 citizens were captured by Hamas and abducted into Gaza, with images circulating on social media of bloodied hostages, and distraught relatives pleading for the state to rescue them.
Yifat Zailer, 37, said she was horrified to see online video footage from Gaza that showed her female cousin and the woman’s children, aged nine months and three years.
“That’s the only confirmation we have,” she told AFP, her voicing breaking with emotion, and adding there was no information on her cousin’s husband and her elderly parents.
“After the army took control of the kibbutz, they weren’t at home,” she said. “We assume they were kidnapped … We want to know what their condition is, we want them to return safe. They’re innocent civilians.”
Israel also came under attack from the north when Lebanon’s Hezbollah launched guided missiles and artillery shells Sunday “in solidarity” with the unprecedented Hamas offensive, without causing any casualties.
Israel responded with artillery strikes across the UN-patrolled border. “We recommend Hezbollah not to come into this,” said army spokesman Richard Hecht. “If they come, we are ready.”
Israel was stunned when Hamas launched their multi-pronged offensive yesterday, the Jewish Sabbath, raining down at least 3,000 rockets as fighters infiltrated towns and kibbutz communities and stormed an outdoor rave party.

Panicked Israeli residents phoned media outlets as they hid in their homes from militants going door to door and shooting civilians or dragging them away.
Two Thai nationals were among those killed, and other Asian nationals, many of whom work as farm labourers in the region, were believed to be among the hostages.
Global concern has mounted, with Western capitals condemning the attack by Hamas, which Washington and Brussels consider a terrorist group.
Israel’s foes have praised the assault, including Iran whose President Ebrahim Raisi voiced support when he spoke with Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders.
Anti-Israel protests have flared in Iraq, Pakistan and some other majority Muslim countries, while Germany and France were among nations stepping up security around Jewish temples and schools.
In the Egyptian city of Alexandria a police officer opened fire “at random” on Israeli tourists Sunday, killing two of them and their Egyptian guide before he was arrested.
Netanyahu – who leads a hard-right coalition government but has received pledges of support from political opponents during Israel’s national emergency – has vowed to turn Hamas hideouts “to rubble” and urged Palestinians there to flee.
“We are embarking on a long and difficult war that was forced on us by a murderous Hamas attack,” Netanyahu wrote on X, formerly Twitter, pledging no “respite”.
US President Joe Biden has voiced “rock solid and unwavering” support for Israel and warned “against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation”.
US Secretary of state Antony Blinken told CNN “we have reports that several Americans were killed” and others missing and “we’re working to verify those reports”.
Hamas has labelled its attack “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood” and called on “resistance fighters in the West Bank” and “Arab and Islamic nations” to join the battle.
Its attack came half a century after the outbreak of the 1973 conflict called the Yom Kippur war in Israel, sparking bitter recriminations on what was widely seen as an enormous intelligence failure.
“There was a very bad failure here,” said Sderot resident Yaakov Shoshani, 70. “The Yom Kippur War was small compared to it, and I was a soldier in the Yom Kippur War.”
He recalled the terror of the attack on their town near Gaza.
“I held a kitchen knife and a large screwdriver, and I told my wife that, if something happens, to make sure to read the Kaddish (prayer) over me, if you stay alive,” he said. “And so we stayed close to each other at home, shut everything and turned off the lights.”
Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh has predicted “victory” and vowed to press ahead with “the battle to liberate our land and our prisoners languishing in occupation prisons”.
Hamas said Saturday it had fired 5,000 rockets, while Israel reported some 3,000 incoming projectiles, as Hamas ground forces launched their assault on nearby israeli communities.
Sderot resident Yitzhak, 67, said he now expected the army to “conquer Gaza house by house, clean the area there properly, and not leave Gaza until they get the very last rocket out of the ground.”
Israeli attacks have reduced several Gaza residential towers to rubble, and another strike completely destroyed a mosque in Gaza’s Khan Yunis.
Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, leading to Israel’s blockade of the impoverished enclave of 2.3 million people.
Israel and Hamas have fought several wars since, with the latest in May killing 34 Palestinians and one Israeli.
Many Gaza residents voiced defiance. “We will not give up, and we are here to stay,” said Mohammed Saq Allah, 23. “This is our land, and we will not abandon our land.”

Israeli ambassador says it's a 'shame' some Irish politicians have Palestine flags on social media,"ISRAEL’S AMBASSADOR TO Ireland has said it is a “shame” that some Irish politicians have posted images of Palestinian flags on their social media accounts.
There is still some fighting under way more than 24 hours after an unprecedented surprise attack from Gaza,in which Hamas militants, backed by a volley of thousands of rockets, broke through Israel’s security barrier and rampaged through nearby communities.
Israel says more than 600 people have died and a further 100 are being held prisoners, while Gaza says the death toll on its side stands at 370.
Speaking on RTÉ’s This week, Israeli ambassador Dana Erlich was asked about Irish politicians who have images of Palestinian flags on their social media feeds.
Elrich responded: “As people who claim to be defending human rights, I think it’s a shame that they don’t comment and they’re very silent whenever an Israeli has been killed.
“I don’t know how you can keep silent again after all of these barbaric images that we’ve seen yesterday, after elderly women being dragged in the streets, bodies of young children, women, mothers, grandmothers, killed in the streets.
“If you can be silent to that, then I don’t know how you can be supportive of human rights.”
Some video footage of the violence that erupted yesterday appears to show Hamas fighters parading a disoriented-looking elderly woman in a golf buggy down a dusty Gaza street while Palestinian crowds cheered.
There has been no official confirmation of the number of deaths on the Israeli side since the fighting erupted early yesterday, but Elrich said she believes this figure “might have risen to around 400 or even more”.
She added that there is no confirmation on how many Israelis are currently being held hostage.
“At the beginning we thought it was dozens, we’re not sure about the final numbers,” said Elrich.
“A lot of the people are still missing, we see their families calling out for them, so we don’t have the exact numbers, we just see the horrified families reporting.”
Elrich said the fighting is “still continuing in the south of Israel” and that “this is nothing like we’ve ever seen before”.
The high death toll and multiple captives appears to point to a major intelligence failure within Israel and undermined the long-held perception that Israel has eyes and ears everywhere in the region.
When asked about a perceived intelligence failure, Elrich said: “It’s something that obviously we’re all asking and there will be investigations.

“Right now, what we are focusing on is what are we doing to defend our people?
“For me, as Ambassador of Israel here in Ireland, is how do I get the international support and Irish support that we need? And we want to thank Ireland for its condemnation.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Micheál Martin have both condemned the unprecedented attack, stating that the violence needed to stop and a peace process needed to take place.
Martin said yesterday that he could “see tensions rising” during a trip to the region last month, and the scale of Saturday’s attack by Hamas was “quite shocking” and launched “without justification”.
He said it was “clearly a breach of international law”.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned of a “long and difficult” war ahead after Palestinian militants launched a massive surprise attack.
“We are embarking on a long and difficult war that was forced on us by a murderous Hamas attack,” Netanyahu wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
When asked about Netanyahu’s response, Elrich said: “This is nothing that we’ve seen in the past 50 years in Israel’s existence, and unfortunately, we all know that we’re headed for a rough time, but we are resilient and we will prevail.”
Elrich added that the Israeli government “always take consideration of the local population” when deciding to carry out an air strike, and that “we always make the most in order not to hurt local civilians”.
“The local Palestinian community, we’re going above and beyond in order not to hurt them. So that is the main difference. We will do anything in our power not to hurt civilians.”
Elrich also stated: “We did not declare war on the Palestinians in Gaza. We declared war on Hamas.
“I want to emphasise that because our hearts go to the people in Gaza, they are hostages and they’re suffering from Hamas as well as we do.”
Netanyahu also warned people living in Gaza to leave as he vowed to turn parts of the territory “into ruins”.
When Elrich was asked where is open for Gazans to seek refuge, she said: “I think all of us should point the finger at Hamas, because that is the leadership that is taking care of those people.
“That is the leadership that chooses to hide in mosques, in hospitals, in bomb shelters, that decides to put infrastructure in rockets instead of electricity, instead of education.
“So that’s where we should be asking all of these questions.”

Sports Minister urges aproportiate response from Israel to outrageous Hamas attack,"SPORTS MINISTER THOMAS Byrne has urged a “proportionate” response from Israel to an “outrageous” attack by Hamas militants.
It comes after a surprise attack against Israel saw gunmen enter villages and thousands of missiles launched into Israel.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Micheál Martin condemned the unprecedented attack, stating that the violence needed to stop and a peace process needed to take place.
Martin said yesterday that Ireland supported Israel’s right to defend itself, but said its response needed to be proportionate.
Asked whether the response had been proportionate, Martin said that more “hard information” was needed to make that assessment.
Junior minister Thomas Byrne today said the attack from Hamas was “absolutely wrong” and “outrageous”.
“Israel is entitled to defend itself, that’s clear. However, it has to be proportionate. They cannot go in and do the same thing, they need to watch what they’re doing as well,” he said, speaking on RTÉ’s The Week In Politics.
“We certainly believe that the ultimate answer to this is what we’ve been advocating for decades, in Fianna Fáil and the Irish government, which is a two-state solution. And we’ve been working to that, and it is time that I suppose the world gets serious about that.”

Sinn Féin has written to the Ceann Comhairle and the parliamentary business committee to request that the parliament reconvenes as soon as possible to discuss hostilities in Gaza and Israel.
Asked whether Sinn Féin condemns the attack by Hamas, TD Mairead Farrell said “of course we condemn… any targeting of civilians”.
Asked about a tweet sent by her party colleague Chris Andrews who said the attack was “a direct result of years of apartheid” in Palestine, as well as Ireland and the EU not holding Israel to account, Farrell said Ireland and the EU did need “to speak out loudly in relation to any breaking of international law”.
Martin, who is also minister for Foreign Affairs, said yesterday evening he now feared for people in Gaza and said it was “vital that the voice of moderation comes to the fore”.
The Tánaiste said that he could “see tensions rising” during a trip to the region last month, and the scale of Saturday’s attack by Hamas was “quite shocking” and launched “without justification”.
He said it was “clearly a breach of international law”.
Martin also said Ireland’s support for a two-state solution had not changed, and that it remained “the only sensible and rational solution to this issue”, but it needed political momentum.
“My sense is that the hardliners are growing in influence, and that’s why I believe the need to have moderate voices in the centre is key.
“So what we need really is a political peace process to get on track in a serious way,” Martin said.","2.37pm, 8 Oct 2023",Pro-Israel, Calls for a measured Israeli response to a Hamas attack.
Micheal Martin says he 'fears for' people in Gaza following 'shocking' Hamas attack on Israel,"LAST UPDATE|7 Oct 2023
TÁNAISTE AND FOREIGN Affairs Minister Micheál Martin has said that he “fears for” people in Gaza as Israel retaliates after an attack by militant group Hamas.
“This was in my view an appalling attack by Hamas, and one which they know the consequences [of] as well,” he told reporters ahead of the Fianna Fáil President’s Dinner in Dublin this evening.
Martin earlier condemned the attacks on X, formerly Twitter, calling for an immediate end to the violence.
“I strongly condemn the firing of rockets into Israel by Hamas and attacks against Israel from Gaza. I deeply regret the loss of life and the impact on civilians. I call for an immediate cessation of all hostilities,” Martin posted.
The Tánaiste’s remarks came after militants in the Gaza Strip carried out an unprecedented infiltration into southern Israel and fired thousands of rockets into the country this morning.
Dozens of Israeli’s have been killed and people were kidnapped in the assault. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Nethanyahu has declared war in response, and the country has already retaliated strongly.
Martin said the scale of today’s attack is “quite shocking”, but that any Israeli response needed to be “proportionate”.
“The scale of this and the attack on civilians I think is to be condemned and it’s quite shocking, the scale of it,” he told reporters ahead of the Fianna Fáil President’s Dinner in Dublin this evening.
Martin said it was vital that the “voice of moderation” come to the fore in terms of bringing an end to the conflict.
Martin also said that the attacks did not dent Ireland’s continued support for a two-state solution to the long running Israeli-Palestine conflict.
He was also asked about Irish peacekeepers serving in the south Lebanon region, and whether there were concerns for them as a result of the escalating situation.
“Obviously the situation there will be relatively tense also and we are monitoring that situation and obviously alert to any potential spillover,” Martin said.
New operation
Hamas sent fighters across the border as they announced the beginning of a new operation. The Israeli military began striking targets in Gaza in response, setting the stage for what is likely to be a new heavy round of fighting between the bitter enemies.
“We are at war, not in an operation or in rounds, but at war,” Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, adding Hamas had launched a “murderous surprise attack” on Israel and its people.
There has been widespread condemnation of the attacks from international leaders.
International reaction
Speaking in the White House this evening, US President Joe Biden said that the United States “stands with Israel” and “we will never fail to have their back”.
“The world has seen appalling images, thousands of rockets in a space of hours raining down on Israeli cities. I got up this morning and started this at 7.30-8 o’clock to hear Hamas terrorists crossing into Israel, killing not only Israeli soldiers but Israeli civilians, in the street and their homes. Innocent people murdered wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas.”

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Israel has an “absolute right to defend itself” after the attacks.
In a post on X, he wrote:
“I am shocked by this morning’s attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli citizens.
French leader Emmanuel Macron also condemned the attacks, and expressed solidarity with the victims.
“I strongly condemn the terrorist attacks currently hitting Israel. I express my full solidarity with the victims, their families and loved ones,” he posted on X.
German leader Olaf Scholz also joined the condemnation.
“Horrifying news reaches us today from #Israel . The rocket fire from Gaza and the escalating violence shock us deeply. Germany condemns these Hamas attacks and stands by Israel,” he posted.
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the attacks are “terrorism in its most despicable form”.
“I unequivocally condemn the attack carried out by Hamas terrorists against Israel,” she posted.
Meanwhile, Lebanon’s Hezbollah congratulated Hamas for the operation, saying it had “divine backing”.
The group said the attack is a response to “Israel’s crimes” and attacks on holy places and that “the will of the Palestinian people and the rifle of the resistance is the only alternative to face occupation”.
Hezbollah said that its military command in Lebanon is following the developments on the ground and is in direct contact with the Palestinian command and they are both “evaluating the situation and the ongoing operation”.
History
The attacks have come after weeks of heightened tensions along Israel’s volatile border with Gaza, and heavy fighting in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Israel has maintained a blockade over Gaza since Hamas, an Islamic militant group that opposes Israel, seized control of the territory in 2007.
The bitter enemies have fought four wars since then. There have also been numerous rounds of smaller fighting between Israel and Hamas and other smaller militant groups based in Gaza.
The blockade, which restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, has devastated the territory’s economy. Israel says the blockade is needed to keep militant groups from building up their arsenals. The Palestinians say the closure amounts to collective punishment.
The rocket fire comes during a period of heavy fighting in the West Bank, where nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military raids this year.
Israel says the raids are aimed at militants, but stone-throwing protesters and people not involved in the violence have also been killed. Palestinian attacks on Israeli targets have killed more than 30 people.

Day of bloodshed as Hamas launches surprise attack and Israel responds in 'state of war',"LAST UPDATE|7 Oct 2023
AT LEAST 70 people have been reported killed in Israel and Gaza authorities have reported a death toll of 198 people in the bloodiest escalation in the Israel-Palestinian conflict since May 2021.
Hamas militants fired thousands of rockets and sent dozens of fighters into Israeli towns near the Gaza Strip in an unprecedented surprise early morning attack during a major Jewish holiday on Saturday, killing dozens and stunning the country.
Israel said it is now at war with Hamas and launched airstrikes in Gaza, vowing to inflict an “unprecedented price”. Hamas militants were still fighting gunbattles inside several Israeli communities hours after the incursion began.
Israeli fighter jets struck three multi-storey buildings in Gaza in response, AFP journalists reported, sending clouds of dust into the sky as the towers of more than 10 floors each collapsed.
“The Hamas terrorist organisation deliberately places its military assets in the heart of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” the army said a statement confirming the strike.
“Prior to the strike, the IDF (army) provided advance warning to the occupants … and asked them to evacuate.”
Irish citizens in Israel have been urged to take caution and shelter in place.
“Due to rocket fire on Israel and an ongoing attack by Gaza militants we advise citizens to exercise extreme caution, shelter in place and follow the instructions of local Israeli authorities,” the Irish embassy in the wider Tel Aviv region said.
Israel’s national rescue service said at least 70 people were killed and hundreds wounded in the Hamas attacks, making it the deadliest attack in Israel in years.
An unknown number of Israeli soldiers and civilians were also seized and taken into Gaza, an enormously sensitive issue for Israel.
At least 198 people in the Gaza Strip have been killed in Israel’s retaliation and at least 1,610 wounded, the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said.
The strength, sophistication and timing of the attack shocked Israelis.
Hamas fighters used explosives to break through the border fence enclosing the long-blockaded Mediterranean territory, then crossed with motorcycles, pickup trucks, paragliders and speed boats on the coast.
Bodies of dead Israeli civilians and Hamas militants were seen on the streets of Israeli towns.
Associated Press photos showed an abducted elderly Israeli woman surrounded by gunmen being taken back into Gaza on a golf buggy, and another woman squeezed between two fighters on a motorcycle.
Images on social media appeared to show fighters parading what seemed to be captured Israeli military vehicles through Gaza streets, and a dead Israeli soldier being dragged and trampled by crowd of Palestinians.
The assault threatened to spiral into a greater conflict, mirroring previous conflicts between Israel and the Hamas militants ruling Gaza that brought widespread death and destruction in Gaza and days of rocket fire on Israeli towns.
“We are at war,” Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address, declaring a mass army mobilisation. “Not an ‘operation,’ not a ‘round,’ but at war.”
“The enemy will pay an unprecedented price,” he added, promising that Israel would “return fire of a magnitude that the enemy has not known.”
The shadowy leader of Hamas’ military wing, Mohammed Deif, said the assault was in response to the 16-year blockade of Gaza, Israeli raids inside West Bank cities over the past year, violence at Al Aqsa – the disputed Jerusalem holy site sacred to Jews as the Temple Mount – increasing attacks by settlers on Palestinians and the growth of settlements.
“Enough is enough,” Mr Deif, who does not appear in public, said in the recorded message.
He said the morning attack was only the start of what he called Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, and called on Palestinians from east Jerusalem to northern Israel to join the fight.
“Today the people are regaining their revolution.”
At a meeting of top security officials Saturday, Mr Netanyahu said the first priority was to “cleanse” southern Israel of infiltrators, followed by a greater retaliation in Gaza.
Serious incursion
The serious incursion on Simchat Torah, a normally joyous day when Jews complete the annual cycle of reading the Torah scroll, revived painful memories of the 1973 Mideast war practically 50 years to the day, in which Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, aiming to take back Israeli-occupied territories.
Comparisons with one of the most traumatic moments in Israeli history sharpened criticism of Netanyahu and his far-right allies, who had campaigned on more aggressive action against threats from Gaza.
Political commentators lambasted the government over its failure to anticipate what appeared to be a Hamas attack unseen in its level of planning and co-ordination.
Asked by reporters how Hamas had managed to catch the army off guard, Lt Col Richard Hecht, an Israeli army spokesman, replied: “That’s a good question.”
The Israeli military hit targets in Gaza in response for some 2,500 rockets that sent air raid sirens wailing constantly as far north as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, some 50 miles away.
It said its forces were engaged in gunfights with Hamas militants who had infiltrated Israel in at least seven locations. The abduction of Israeli civilians and soldiers raised a particularly thorny issue for Israel.

Their number was not immediately known.
Videos released by Hamas appeared to show at least three Israelis captured alive, and AP photos showed at least three civilians taken in Gaza, including the two women.
Israeli television showed images of a young man stripped down to his pants being led on foot in a chokehold and reported that elderly women with dementia as well as workers from Thailand and the Philippines were among the captives.
The Israeli military confirmed that a number of Israelis had been taken captive.
A top Hamas official, Saleh Arouri, told Al-Jazeera TV that his group is holding “a large number” of Israeli prisoners, including senior officers, adding that they will be used in a prisoner exchange to free Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails.
Neither side said how many. Israel has a history of making heavily lopsided exchanges in order to bring captive Israelis home.
“A grave mistake”
In a televised address, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant warned that Hamas had made “a grave mistake” and promised that “the state of Israel will win this war”.
Western nations condemned the incursion and reiterated their support for Israel, while others called for restraint on both sides.
“The US unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians,” said Adrienne Watson, spokeswoman for the US National Security Council.
“We stand firmly with the government and people of Israel and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks.”
Watson said Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, has spoken to Israeli counterpart, Tzachi Hanegbi.
Micheál Martin condemned the attacks on X, formerly Twitter, calling for an immediate end to the violence.
“I strongly condemn the firing of rockets into Israel by Hamas and attacks against Israel from Gaza. I deeply regret the loss of life and the impact on civilians. I call for an immediate cessation of all hostilities,” Martin posted.
Saudi Arabia, which has been in talks with the US about normalising relations with Israel, released a statement calling on both sides to exercise restraint.
The kingdom said it had repeatedly warned about “the dangers of the situation exploding as a result of the continued occupation (and) the Palestinian people being deprived of their legitimate rights”.
Protests
The attack comes at a time of historic division within Israel over Netanyahu’s proposal to overhaul the judiciary.
Mass protests over the plan have sent hundreds of thousands of Israeli demonstrators into the streets and prompted hundreds of military reservists to avoid volunteer duty, turmoil that has raised fears over the military’s battlefield readiness and raised concerns about its deterrence over its enemies.
It also comes at a time of mounting tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, who have felt increasing despair with the peace process effectively dead for years and no resolution to Israel’s occupation.
Over the past year Israel’s far-right government has ramped up settlement construction in the occupied West Bank, Israeli settler violence has displaced hundreds of Palestinians there, and tensions have flared around a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site.
The wide-ranging assault threatened to undermine Netanyahu’s reputation as a security expert who would do anything to protect Israel.
It also raised questions about the cohesion of a security apparatus crucial to the stability of a country locked in low-intensity conflicts on multiple fronts and facing threats from Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group.
Hezbollah congratulated Hamas on Friday, praising the attack as a response to “Israeli crimes” and saying the militants had “divine backing”.
The group said its command in Lebanon was in contact with Hamas about the operation.
Israel has maintained a blockade over Gaza since Hamas seized control of the territory in 2007. The bitter enemies have fought four wars since then.
The blockade, which restricts the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, has devastated the territory’s economy.
Israel says the blockade is needed to keep militant groups from building up their arsenals. The Palestinians say the closure amounts to collective punishment.
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military raids in the West Bank, which has seen heavy fighting. Israel says the raids are aimed at militants, but stone-throwing protesters and people uninvolved in the violence have also been killed.
Palestinian attacks on Israeli targets have killed over 30 people.
The tensions have also spread to Gaza, where Hamas-linked activists held violent demonstrations along the Israeli border in recent weeks.
Those demonstrations were halted in late September after international mediation.
